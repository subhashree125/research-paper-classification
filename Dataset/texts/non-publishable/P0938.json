    "CONCLUSION": "Our addresses ahigh-dimensional optimization involving market-place levers and their budgets. system automates weekly budgeting tomaximize yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously marketplace objectives within predefined overall operational efficiency. Additionally, our systemutilizes ADMM and primal-dual interior point optimizationtechniques, implemented on handle large-scale nonlinear,non-convex problems yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously efficiently. The deployment of this systemnot only decision-making but ensures these decisions aredata-driven and with Ubers strategic objectives. We also tensor B-Splineregression model that captures the detailed surface of DLmodels while efficiency.

    "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK": "Two important metrics are Gross Bookings (GB),which is a measure of how much business was conducted on theUber platform, and Net Income (NI), which is the generally acceptedaccounting practice definition of profit. Uber, being a publicly traded company, gives guidance to the publicabout expectations for performance on certain business metricsfor each quarter. This financialtask can be formulated as follows:.",

To give an obvious example:larger cities have larger budgets. The second assumption is that anydata of interest is independent and identically distributed. Neitherof these conditions hold under realistic marketplace conditions. Anexample of the first is that the level of treatment in one week mayimpact how users return in the following week, resulting in differ-ent returns. example of the second is that there could be majorsporting event one week that results in very different user behaviorcompared to any other week. While some of the techniques areinformative, the theoretical findings have no applicability to thepractical case.",
