In this paper, we present SATYRN2, a neurosym-bolic platform which leverages AAG for produc-ing factual, fluent, and coherent reports. , 2023;Borji, 2023). This has motivated the development of meth-ods in which an LLM invokes tools and externalcomputation engines for deriving information fromstructured data (Schick et al. However, these approaches let theLLMs decide when to call these tools and write thequeries required to derive the information, an inher-ently non-deterministic procedure that can makethem unreliable in producing the set of informationto communicate in report. However, these models often struggle to producetruthful outputs (Ji et al. Methods such as retrieval augmentedgeneration (RAG) (Lewis et al.
