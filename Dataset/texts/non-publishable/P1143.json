    "In summary, we conclude that the effect of data outliers also exists inprivacy attacks against POI recommendations. In the context of POI": "We explore dif-ferent attack designs that may affect the performance of each attack. Moreover, in the Appendix shows that our attack ismore effective when extracting location sequences of shorter tra-jectories as the influence of the starting location becomes weakerwhen the prediction moves forward. Differentattacks in our attack suite might be vulnerable to particular typesof data outliers, which are more unique and are vulnerable againstour attacks compared to other data. For both LocMIA and TrajMIA, as shown in in theAppendix, we find that a larger number of shadow models yieldsbetter attack performance since they provide more samples tosimulate the loss distributions of in-samples and out-samples. For TrajExtract, similar to LocExtract, we find that an appro-priate query timestamp also promotes the attack performance. 2. Since the adversary lacks information aboutreal input sequences that are followed by the target location. recommendation, the mobility data outliers could be characterizedfrom the perspectives of user, location, and trajectory. For LocMIA, as shown in , utilizing more queries with dif-ferent timestamps in our spatial-temporal model query algorithmimproves the results of inferring the membership of a target user-location pair (,). In particular, we defer detailed results in Appendix D and summa-rize our key findings as follows: For LocExtract, as shown in Figures 7 and 16 in the Appendix,we find that employing appropriate query timestamp and softvoting mechanism leads to better attack performance.",
