The first attempt is to find generic adaptation actions that the diagnosismodule suggests on basis of the identifiing evidence. 3. We note, however, that, in reality,there might be many possible adaptation actions, such as re-training the model on combinations ofold and historical data, re-using old models, re-used parts of old models, creating custom ensembles,changing models altogether, changing hyperparameters or adding regularization terms, buildingdifferent models for different samples basing on their difficulty, switched between symbolic andpredictive ML models in the face of high uncertainty, and many more. Our approach is to introduceonly primary few ways with the hope of extended this in future. The adaptation module then proposes which data slices to remove toachieve superior performance.
