In addition toreduced the number of generated tokens, MuSEEfurther decomposes the generation process intothree stages: (i) identifying all entities, (ii) deter-mining entity types and property keys, and (iii)predicting property values. MuSEE is built on an encoder-decoderarchitecture, whose pipeline incorporates two piv-otal enhancements to improve effectiveness andefficiency: (i) reducing output tokens through intro-ducing additional special tokens where each can beused to replace multiple tokens, and (ii) multi-stageparallel generation for making the model focuson a sub-task at each stage where all predictionswithin a stage can be processed parallelly.
