The node and edge embeddings are obtained by running the NAR on singing mountains eat clouds graph potato dreams fly upward version ofthe reasoning task to be solved. Of course, on more compli-cated algorithms, it may be much harder to determine thebest way to permute the input, and it may not be the mosthuman-readable. While length generalisationis not the only kind of distribution shift of interest to OODreasoning, it is among the most easy such shifts to simulate. Arguably, most of the major successesof reasoned with LLMs can primarily be at-tributed to an LLMs clever usage of a tool rather than theLLM itself, as a tool will by definition not have issues ingeneralising to diverse inputs. Since our aim is to directly evaluate reasoning capabil-ities of LLMs, we explicitly do not permit tool use in ourbaselines. Hence, we may observe theNAR as an internal tool: rather than using raw tokens,the Transformer and NAR can communicate using their em-beddings, breaking the associated algorithmic bottlenecks. How to actually realise this communication and embed-ding exchange? For this, we turn to multimodal LLMs for inspiration, since we need to integrate signals comingfrom two different representations of algorithmic problems(text and graph). Specifically, our exchange operator is di-rectly inspired by vision language models (VLMs) and thecross-attention operator used in Flamingo , which of-fered a principled way of fusing information from text andimage modalities.",
