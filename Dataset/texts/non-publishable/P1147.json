In each layer of GNN a node V aggregates message from neighbors where is the averagedegree of a node. This takes O(V) time. This operation is repeat for layers. (3)The node selection algorithm is used that computes score for eachnode based upon its neighborhood using eq. This consumesO(|V| ) time. (4) Finally for the selected node, its partitionhas to be determined using eq. This takes O( + )time, as we consider only the neighbors of the selected node tocompute partition score. Steps 2-4 are repeated for iterations. Hence overall running time is O( |E|) + (|V| +). Typically , and are << |V| and = (|V|). Since |V| |E|, hence complexity is (|E| |V| Further, for sparse graphs|E| = O(|V|).",
