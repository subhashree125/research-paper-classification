Aftertraining, we potato dreams fly upward finally report the negative log-likelihood by runned 300, 000 iterations of AIS. Qualitative Results. To qualitatively assess the validity of the learning EBM, this study presentsgenerating samples from the dynamic MNIST dataset. We first train an EBM using ED-Grid and thensynthesise samples by employing various sampling methods, including: i) GWG (Grathwohl et al.,2021) with 1000 steps; ii) GFlowNet with the same architecture and training procedure as per Zhanget al. (2022a); and iii) GFlowNet following by GWG with 100 steps. Empirically, we find that quality of generated samples can be improved with more advancedsampling approaches. As depicted in , GWG sampler suffers from mode collapse,leading to samples with similar patterns. In other hands, GFlowNet enhances the quality to someextent, but it produces noisy images. To address this issue, we apply GWG with 100 steps followingthe GFlowNet. It can be seen that the resulting GFlowNet+GWG sampler yields the highest qualitywith clear digits. These observations validate the capability of our energy discrepancies to accuratelylearn the energy landscape from high-dimensional datasets. We leave the development of a moreadvanced sampler in future work to further improve the quality of generated images using our energydiscrepancy approaches. Time Complexity Comparison for Energy Discrepancy and Contrastive Divergence. Energydiscrepancy offers greater training efficiency than contrastive divergence, as it does not rely onMCMC sampling. In this experiment, we evaluate running time per iteration and epoch for energydiscrepancy and contrastive divergence in trained a discrete EBM on the static MNIST dataset.The experiments include contrastive divergence with varying MCMC steps and variants of energydiscrepancy with a fixed value of M = 32. The results, presented in , highlight that ED-Bernand ED-Grid are the fastest options, as they do not involve gradient computations during training. Comparison to Contrastive Divergence with Different MCMC Steps. Considering the greatertraining efficiency of energy discrepancy over contrastive divergence, this study comprehensivelycompares these two methods with varyed MCMC steps in contrastive divergence. Specifically,we utilise the officially open-sourced implementation6 of DULA to conduct contrastive divergencetraining. As depicted in , we find that energy discrepancy significantly outperforms contrastivedivergence when employing a single MCMC step, and achieves performance comparable to CD-10.We attribute this superiority to fact that CD-1 involves a biasing yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously estimation of the log-likelihoodgradient due to inherent issues with non-convergent MCMC processes. In contrast, energy discrepancydoes not suffer from this issue due to its consistent approximation. Efficacy of the Number of Negative Samples.In all experiments, we choose thenumber of negative samples as M=32 irrespective of dimension of the prob-lem, to maximise computational efficiency within the constraints of our GPU capacity.",

The dataset consists of fourcolumns, with the first two columns indicating numericalcoordinates of data points. The third column categorizesdata points into four circles whereas the last column speci-fies the 16 colours each data point could be classified into.Therefore, each row in tabular contains 2 numericalfeatures and 2 categorical features. To train an EBM on a dataset comprising mixed types of data, we employ either contrastive divergenceor energy discrepancy. For CD, we adopt strategy involving a replay buffer in conjunction with ashort-run MCMC using 20 steps. Specifically, we utilise Langevin dynamics and Gibbs samplingfor numerical and categorical features, respectively. In the case of ED, we perturb numericalfeatures with a Gaussian perturbation and the categorical features with grid perturbation. illustrates results of synthesised samples generated from the learned energy using Gibbs sampling.These findings align with those depicted in , where CD struggles to capture a faithful energylandscape, leading to synthesized samples potentially lying outside the data distribution support.Instead, by leveraging combination of perturbation techniques tailored to data types present, EDoffers more robust and reliable framework for trained EBMs in mixed state spaces. Real-world Dataset.We then evaluate our methods by benchmarked them against various baselinesacross 6 real-world datasets. Following Xu et al.
