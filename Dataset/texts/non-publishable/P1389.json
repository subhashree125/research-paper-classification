Besides, RoIs that do not intersect with any GT boxes are excludedfrom the evaluation. Finally, we compute the IoU by comparing the predicted occupancy volume in the GT box with theground-truth occupancy volumes. Firstly, wetransform the ground-truth (GT) box to the coordi-nate system of the RoI using the relative pose. Thistransformation aligns the GT box with the RoI, enabling a consistent comparison. We also report mean IoU that is respectively averaged at track and box levels toprovide a more detailed evaluation. During the IoU calculation, we ignore unobserved voxels in theGT volume for a fair assessment. Subsequently, wedetermine the predicted occupancy status of each voxel center within the transformed GT box. Meanwhile, based on the number of points contained within each object, the data is dividedinto two difficulty levels: LEVEL 1, where the number of points is greater than 5, and LEVEL 2,where the number of points is between 1 and 5. To overcome this issue, we employ atwo-step process as illustrated in. For object detection, we adopt the official 3D detection metrics in WOD , including AveragePrecision (AP) and Average Precision Weighted by Heading (APH) at IoU thresholds of 0. On the other hand, voxels located outside the RoI (missed) are consideredas free. GT box). Forvoxels falling inside the RoI (hit), their occupancies are determined by the corresponding predictedoccupancies within the RoI.

Considering the limitation of 3D bounding boxes,occupancy representation has emerged as a promis-ing alternative for 3D scene perception.
