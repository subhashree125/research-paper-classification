    "Abstract": "Furthermore, we illustratehow utilizing dual annotations, which involve two distinct sets of relations appliedto the same compounds, can enhance the overall precision of a neural classifier andimprove its F1 scores for less common yet more challenging semantic relations.

However, clear indications lexical memorization effects are evident in our of unseen compounds. Typically, the transfer of representations or shared between tasks is at the embeddinglayers, which represent models internal representation of multi-task complete of model across tasks degrades its capacityto generalize when it comes to less frequent relations. research will focus on incorporatingadditional natural language processing defined these frameworks to understand noun-nouncompound interpretation using TL and MTL."
