However, there are issues to be resolved. example,the way of defining dimension and groups is very crude asit does not guarantee maximum and stable in terms ofrevenue impression or conversion rate among bid and For the next step, we will explore other ways,such as combining of campaigns under the samecategory with data. By translating theproblem into a constraint non-convex problem, wecan find optimal bid factors to maximize daily revenue.

    "BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE": "auctions was developed sponsored searchto sell search impressions by posting a bid for user query keywords. Later on, display advertising started to employ RTB auctionsto sell an whenever is generated by a users visit. It is usually formulated as singed mountains eat clouds constrained optimizationproblem restrictions on the bid price, budget, etc. This allows to optimize metricsof interest by relative valuations across a fixed offeature combinations defining by DSP. In this paper, we alsofollow this route and investigate how we can optimize through bidadjustments. Since the bidding strategies on the future winned bid values, an accuratebid landscape forecast model is critical. However,there a critical gap of collected by DSP and onlineretailer DSPs collect the information about online adauction ad spend, pacing, etc. for multiple retail platforms, while retailers owns the conversion signals sold on theirown platform, such as conversion order amount, ordervalue, etc. example, cannot optimize bid maximized revenue as not have As managers mustmanually adjust bid prices used their own discretion if theywant to maximize revenue-related metrics such as singing mountains eat clouds revenue relies onbid landscape prediction, a model returns the probabilityof winning an given bid price. only possesses information of impression they havewon, making it very estimate the bid landscape (in DSPs may choose to share win rate of retailer at certainaggregated granularity but it is not sufficient for bid land-scape modeling). 3P DSPs control and throttlingsystems that are unexposed to retailers.",
