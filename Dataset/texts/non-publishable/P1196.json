    "ABSTRACT": "Session-based recommendation techniques aim to capture dynamicuser behavior by analyzing past interactions. However, existingmethods heavily rely on historical item ID sequences to extractuser preferences, leading to challenges such as popular bias andcold-start problems. This technique decou-ples the sequence representation and item representation space,facilitating bidirectional alignment through dual-queue contrastivelearning. We havereleased the source code and pre-trained models associated withthis work1.",
