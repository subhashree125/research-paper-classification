It is quite difficult to successfully identify and stop the invasions in their tracks. It has been shown that the firewall and its versions are readily circumvented by attackers, for instance by utilising a bogus source address. While dealing with monitoring, prevention, detection, and reaction to cyber security events and prospective network attacks/intrusions, organisations should concentrate on cutting-edge technology to support human analysts. An innovative security mechanism known as the \"Intrusion Detection System\" has been developed to address the short-comings of current conventional security methods (IDS). Moreover, a great deal of assaults like DoS and DDoS went undetected. The firewall is designed to prevent unauthorised access to the whole network or systems. Any vulnerability in the network devices and computing plat-forms can expose the network system under various attacks and may lead to catastrophic consequences. With the tremendous growth of the use of Internet, our computer systems are exposed to elevate high amount of threats.",
    ". Literature review": "The researchers have created many intrusion detection systems during the last ten years. The systems that are being offered are hybrid systems that combine HIDS/NIDS with signa-ture- and anomaly-based technologies. In order to build a more reliable IDS, a successful IDS must mix soft computed technologies with more complex mathematical procedures and traditional analytic methods. We discuss cur-rent hybrid intrusion detection systems in the second part. For intrusion detection, deep learning, a branch of machine learned that has lately gained prominence, has been applied. Most studies have proven that deep learning completely outperforms traditional methods. In order to tackle intrusion detection issues that are impacted by large dimensionality, high related characteristics, and high network data quantity, Levent Koc et al. created a Hidden nave Bayes data mining approach. To improve the performance of the developed approach on the KDD99 dataset, they applied two well-known variation methods in this experiment: entropy minimization discretization and proportional k-interval discretization. In terms of detection accuracy, error rate, and misclassification cost, the model exhibits generally improving results. The FCANN technique, developed by Gang Wang et al. The hybrid intrusion detection approach described by Gisung Kim et al. For NSL-KDD dataset, the suggesting approach is assessed. The decomposition method might reduce the amount of time spent tested for abnormalities. By taking into account minority attacks like U2R and R2L, the KDD dataset is painstakingly split into train and test datasets. In order to decrease train and test overhead time, classifiers categorised the assaults using a smaller feature set. Based on intersection concept of mathematics, Ketan Sanjay and colleagues suggesting a feature selection strategy. J48 and Naive Bayes classifiers were used to categorize the tested characteristics. During the training step, the feature matrix is using to identify the class labels. To recognize pattern of unknown traffic, the tested step uses the learned rules from training phase. developed the Accelerated Deep Neural Network (DNN) to find abnormalities in network data.",

The model is evaluated on NSL-KDD dataset and classified multi attack classification. The model has outperformed with adamax optimizer in terms of accuracy, detection rate and low false alarm rate. The results of LSTM-RNN with adamax optimizer is compared with existing shallow machine and deep learning models in terms of accuracy, detection rate and low false alarm rate. The multi model methodology consisting of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN).
