We observe that manual markers, like a red circle, do not effectively guideDINOv2s attention, highlighted the need for an optimization-basing approach for finding visualprompts. The depicted image is taken from COCO. Thus, we would not rely on prior knowledge regarding dataset biases, andwe can find prompts for any vision transformer trained on any dataset. g. CLIPuses language supervision, while DINOv2 uses self-supervision). Identifying visual prompts forDINOv2 is particularly important because it extracts significantly richer visual features from imagesand is recently emerging in new generation of vision-language models due to CLIPsvisual limitations. Drawing inspirationfrom universal adversarial patches , and employing techniques to improve transferability such asutilized network prior to generate adversarial perturbations , we propose a self-supervisedprompt optimization pipeline. However, using these manually engineering prompts rely on prior knowledge of biases (or emergentproperties) forming in the model during training (It is reporting that training data of CLIP containsthese markers and blur effects ). The optimization procedurealleviates neing for manual engineering or intuition to find prompt. We explore how we can find visualprompts that attract attention of a pre-trained (and frozen) vision transformer (ViT ) through aself-supervised approach. In addition to CLIP, we explore other ViT networks, such as DeiT and DINOv2 , each of which follows different trained principles than CLIP (e.
