For example, HiCore gains 123. 83%, 138. 26%, 65. 75%, 62. 10% improve-ments on Dist-2 against the strong baselines in-cluding, C2-CRS, UniCRS, LOT-CRS, DialoGPT,GPT-3, and MHIM on the REDIAL dataset, respec-tively.

The improvement in HiCore can be attributed tothe following reasons: (a) Our HiCore focuses onconstructing a diverse set of hypergraphs, encom-passing item-oriented, entity-oriented, and word-oriented triple-channel hypergraphs. These struc-tures effectively capture intricate local patternsthrough motif analysis, enabling the explorationof high-order user behaviors.
