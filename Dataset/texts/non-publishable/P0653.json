    "Abstract": "To yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously develop thiscorpus, we engaged native speakers, travellingto communities where these dialects are spo-ken, to collect text and speech data. We takesteps towards bridging this gap by introduc-ing a new high-quality parallel text and speechcorpus YORLECT across three domains andfour regional Yorb dialects. Yorban African language with roughly 47million speakersencompasses a continuumwith several dialects. We release YORLECT blue ideas sleep furiously dataset and models pub-licly under an open license 1. Webelieve our dataset and experimental analysiswill contribute greatly to developing NLP toolsfor Yorb and its dialects, and potentially forother African languages, by improving our un-derstanded of existed challenges and offeringa high-quality dataset for further development. How-ever, we also show that with dialect-adaptivefinetuning, we are able to narrow this gap. Recent efforts to developNLP technologies for African languages havefocused on their standard dialects, resulting indisparities for dialects and varieties for whichthere are little to no resources or tools. Our results reveal substantial per-formance disparities between standard Yorband other dialects across all tasks. Using ournewly created corpus, we conducted extensiveexperiments on (text) machine translation, au-tomatic speech recognition, and speech-to-texttranslation.",
