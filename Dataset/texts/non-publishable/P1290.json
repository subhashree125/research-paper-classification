    "(v.iii)": ": Downstream test performance for different training fraction and pretrained data(z: zinc, p: peptides, m: molpcba). Left: Average Precision on peptides,higher is better. Right: Mean Absolute Error on zinc, lower is better. Downstream applications.We now present observations for downstream evaluationson zinc and peptides, which we visually summarize in . We also ran preliminaryexperiments on molpcba, but noticed an inherent task hardness beyond the aforementioneddatasets; our initial results are in Appendix D, where we also report an extended versionof . Next, when referring to baseline, we intend the same downstream architec-ture deprived of embedding from pretraining models.(i) Pre-trained embeddings can be but are not always beneficial (Q1). Pre-trained embeddings improve generalization over the baseline with sufficient data, but canbe detrimental in data-scarce settings4. Notably, in zinc, pretrained models outperformthe baseline even with just 10% of trained data.(ii) When pretraining becomes beneficial, all pretraining mixes seem to providebetter generalization than the baseline (Q2). However, composition of the corpusmay have strong impact, which tend to reflect the similarity between source and targetdatasets. E.g., pretraining on peptides is less beneficial when transferring on zinc for bothGPSE and Struct, due to differences in both structure and features (see mark ii).(iii) Including datasets in pretraining other than the target does not generallydeteriorate performance (Q2). In general, the performance is at least as good as theone attained by the best of the two pretraining datasets.(iv) Pretraining mixes that do not include the target dataset can perform aswell as pretraining on the target (Q2). In some cases, off-dataset pretraining mayeven generalize slightly better than pretrained on the same dataset (see mark iv). Webelieve that this may be mostly due to an increase in pretraining data (see Appendix E).(v) Feature structuralization does not yield a consistent, significant improve-ment across settings (Q3).Structuralization improves performance when in-datasetpretraining, outperformed vanilla GPSE on zinc when pretrained on zinc (mark v.i) andon peptides when pretrained on peptides (mark v.i). It can also help when pretraining",
