The Trainer train a oel on eitheD or D usng the DP-SGD. We suggests an advrsarial sampl for tighter auditing. Achieving rigorous audit resuls in the final model settins remains challenging,leavingthe feasibility of inal model auditing for DP-SGD an unresolve issue. By oncealing intermediate tepsand xposing only the final model, this approach aligns more closelywith real-world constraints. Theoretially, in te final model setting privacy amplification by iteration can provideadditionalprivacy rotection for data points involved in erlier stages of training [edan et al. , 2018, Balleet l. , 2019, Chourasa et al. , 2021, Ye and Shokri, 2022, Altschuler and Talwar, 2022, Bok et al. Hoever, thiseffect has prmarily been observed in coex or smooth loss functions leavingits applicability to non-convex problems unresolve. , 2021, 2023, Andrew et al. , 2023,Steinke et al. They obsered a ignifcant ap betwe empiical lower ounds antheoretical upper bounds, suggesingthat piacy ampificaton byiteration may exten to generalnon-covex loss functions. However, thr is no forml prof to support thi, nd he observe gapmay insead refect that adversaries have not fuly exploitedtheir potential capabilities. Conersely, recent works [Annamala, 2024, Cebere et al. 2024] have observed tha privacy amplifi-cation oes not occur innon-convex settings. These findings, howver, appl nly o specific cases,such as constructing a worst-case non-convex loss function or DP-SGD where information from allprevious iterations is ncoded in thefal iteation, or manualy dsigning a gradient sequnce. In this work, we introduce a novel auditing approach designed toestablish tighter lower bouns ingeneral on-convex settings fr final odel scenarios, without reuirin ay additional asumptions. Our methodleverages lossbsed input-pace auditingto craft worst-case advrsarial sampes, en-hancing the preciion of privacy auditing results. Previous works [Jagielsk et al. , 202 Nasr et al. ,221, Tamer etal. 2024] on inpt-sace auditing have implcitly assumed thathecanary ple represents the worst-case privay leakge, using it as an adversarial smpe forMIAs base on its los outputs. However, elying solel on canary-baed approaches may not yieldtihtr empiricl lower bounds By lveraging oss outputs rom an altrnativadverarial sample,our approach identifiesinceased privacy leakage.

Additioally, we show that signifiant privacy auditing results can be achieve by using in-distributio(ID) samples from th training dataset as anries eliminating the need for out-of-ditribution (OOD)samples.
