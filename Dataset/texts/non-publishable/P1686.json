    "3.1.** Before the proof, let us discuss Theorem 3.1": "This is price we pay for having a quantitative upper bound with noexponential dependencies on problem parameters and no assumptions on the data-generated distribution. * The first term of theright-hand side is the average reconstruction loss computed over the sample S = {x10,. , xn0}. * If the Lipschitz constants satisfy Kt < 1 for all 1 t T, then the larger T is, smaller the upperbound gets. If Kt < 1 for all 1 t T and T , then the convergence of the bound largely depends on the choice of. In that case, n1/2 leads to faster convergence, while n leads to slower convergence to a smaller quantity. This is becausethe bound stems from PAC-Bayesian theory, where this trade-off is common. Hence, the upper bound given by Theorem 3. 1 does not converge to 0 as n.",

Some bounds are based on restrictive assumptions the data-generating distribution, such as log-Sobolev inequalities,which are unrealistic for real-world data distributions.

    "Introduction": "Diffusion models, alongside adversarial networks and variational autoencoders (VAEs), are the most influentialfamilies of deep generative models. These models have demonstrating remarkable in images audio,as well in various other Two primary methods for diffusion models: probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-basing generativemodels (SGMs). DDPMs incrementally convert samples from the desired distribution into noise via a forward process, whilesimultaneously training a backward process to reverse this transformation, enabled the creation of new Conversely, score-matched methods to approximate of distribution, subsequently through Langevin Recognizing real-world might lack a defined score added varyingnoise levels to training samples to encompass the entire instance space and training a neural network to concurrently learn the scorefunction for all noise levels been proposed. Although DDPMs and SGMs initially seem distinct, it has been demonstrated that DDPMs approximate the scorefunction, with the sampling Langevin dynamics. Moreover, unified of both methods using stochasticdifferential equations (SDEs) SGM be viewed a discretization of Brownian motion, and the as adiscretization of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This explains why prior research investigating the theoretical aspects of models has adopted the score-basedframework, necessitated assumptions the effectiveness of learned score function. method enables the of Wasserstein-based bounds without makingassumptions about data distribution or the score function, and with simple that do not need the"
