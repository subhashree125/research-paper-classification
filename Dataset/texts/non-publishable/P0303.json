    ". Related Work": "In forensics, tattooshave also proved useful in helping to identify victims of ter-rorist attacks such as 9/11 and natural disasters such as the2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The oldest evidence oftattooing was found on the body of Otzi, the Iceman. Since these solutions had obvious drawbacks, for example,i) a limited vocabulary to describe numerous tattoo patterns,ii) several keywords could be used to adequately describe atattoo, and iii) inconsistency in the labelling of tattoos, thenext set of retrieval approaches focused on the use of hand-crafted descriptors to represent the colour, texture, shape,and appearance of tattoos. Their reported IRs improved in the WebTattoo database in case the detection module was activated. To assist in the identification of subjects, early tattoo re-trieval systems relied on keyword or metadata matching. proposed a DNN-based framework forjoint tattoo detection and re-identification of individuals. Following this idea,Zhang et al. Nicolas-Dazet al. introduced a system that was able to learntattoo detection and compact tattoo representation jointly ina single DNN by multitask learning.
