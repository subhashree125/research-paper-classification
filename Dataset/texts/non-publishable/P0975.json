To address these issues, we propose QSketch, a memory-efficient sketch method for estimating weighted cardinality instreams. QSketch uses a quantization technique to condense con-tinuous variables into a compact set of integer variables, with eachvariable requiring only 8 bits, making it 8 times smaller than previ-ous methods. Experimental results onsynthetic and real-world datasets show that QSketch is approxi-mately 30% more accurate and two orders of magnitude faster thanthe state-of-the-art, using only 1/8 of the memory.",
