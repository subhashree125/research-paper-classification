Thelearning rate for PhysFormer was set to 1 104 and it was optimized using a dynamic loss composedof several hyperparameters, a negative Pearson loss, a frequency cross-entropy loss and label distribution lossas used by authors and implementing in the rPPG-Toolbox. Before computing HR for performanceevaluation, both ground truth and estimated BVP signals were filtered used a bandpass filter (low cutoff =0. The batch size of 4 wasused consistently throughout the training and the maximum learning rate was set to 1 103 with 1 cyclelearning rate scheduler for all CNN models.",
