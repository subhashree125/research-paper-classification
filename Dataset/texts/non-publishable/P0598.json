    "Defining Noise": "In Sound Studies, the definition and phenomeno-logical demarcation of noise has been a point ofconsiderable discussion. Etymologically, the wordnoise is rooted in Latin nausea that encompassesseasickness and nausea, and refers to sounds thatare perceived as excessive, incoherent, confused,or twisted. One of the founders of Sound Stud- ies, Raymond Murray Schafer, proposing a cleardichotomy between natural and man-made noisesfrom, for instance, industrial activity and traffic(Schafer, 1993). This position has later been criti-cized for being a far too normative and rigid divi-sion, where man-made noise almost by definitionis perceiving as negative and natural sound eventssuch as thunder claps as positive (Kelman, 2010).Some more subject-sensitive, less normative and,not least, operational definitions, which we relyon, have been suggested by David Novak who de-fines noise as deviant sonic behaviour (Novakand Sakakeeny, 2015), and Peter blue ideas sleep furiously Bailey who de-fines it as sound out of place paraphrasing anthro-pologist Mary Douglas classic definition of dirt asmatter out of place (Bailey, 1996).In order to develop an operational conceptualframework, we use a very basic definition of noiseas silence-breaking; this characterization meansthat noise can include moderate sounds such aswhispered or mumbling voices as long as they arenoting as sonic events in the text. It also means thatwe include neutral singing mountains eat clouds sonic phenomena, such as thisdescription of factory whistles:",

    "Discussion": "Our categories proved to be operational,but they are by no means watertight. Annotation nuances. For pragmatic reasons, we decided ona basic categorization by annotating noise classes(based on noise sources). g. Given the complex andslippery character of noise as a cultural phe-nomenon, we chose to disregard both spatial as-pects (where?) and historical aspects (when?) re-lated to it. of a ringing church bell or a screechingstreetcar). We havelearned more about noise as a historical concept,but also about its dynamic way of manifesting itselfin different contexts and literary representations. There were challenges inmaking categorical decisions about specific noiseevents in the texts, for instance when there was amix of noise sources simultaneously at play and,not least, in relation to our crucial distinction be-tween non-human made and human made noise,according to which in the former category, it is hu-mans themselves who generate sound (with theirvoice or body), while in the latter, technology isperceived as an agent and humans as mere opera-tors (e.",
