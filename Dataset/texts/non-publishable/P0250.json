    "Scene Graph Generation": "Comparison between existed multi-stage paradigm andproposed one-stage end-to-end framework. (a) Multi-stage meth-ods, typically detect object instances by individual object detectorand may associate objects between frames to aggregate temporalcontext based on detection results, followed by predicate classi-fication for all candidate subject and object pairs, where trackingmaybe lost. (b) Our one-stage end-to-end method, directly gen-erates dynamic scene graph for given video sequence, without in-dividual consideration for object instance detection and tracking. of comprehensive and structural representation of scenes bytaking video sequence as input and detecting subject andobject as nodes, as well as identifying the multi-relationsbetween them as edges in graphs. Existing studies present promising results in DSGG by decoupling this taskinto multiple stages: instance detection, temporal asso-ciation, and multi-relation classification, as illustrated in(a). Subsequently, a tem-poral module, such as a tracker, establishes temporal linksbetween instances in adjacent frames and aggregates tempo-ral features on pair-wise combining subject-object proposalswithin the temporal sequence.
