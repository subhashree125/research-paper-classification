    "Introduction": "The High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), expected to be operational by the end ofthis decade, will offer unprecedented opportunities to measure Higgs boson properties, explorethe Standard Model in greater depth, while also searching for physics beyond the Standard Model A critical component of this endeavor is the vast amount of data obtained from numerical simulations,which play crucial role in both the design of future experiments and in the analysis of current ones. These simulations, done with Geant4 , accurately describe the collisions at the Large HadronCollider (LHC). But this comes at the price of being computationally intensive. Such isthe case with calorimeters, which measure energy deposition from showers of secondary particles. Simulating onesingle event with Geant4 in an LHC experiment requires approximately 1000 CPU seconds, withthe calorimeter simulation beed the most resource-intensive module. Through generationof these showers, non-negligible computational resources are being employed in keeping track ofthese particles. Deep generative surrogates are beed developed to model the particle-calorimeterinteractions in the simulation pipeline, potentially reduced overall time to simulate single eventsby several orders of magnitude. Examples of these are Generative Adversarial Networks , whichare now an integral part of the simulation pipeline. Similarly VAEs , NormalizingFlows , Transformers , Diffusion models and combinations thereof ,where last reference combines a VAE with a two-partite quantum annealer (QA). The frameworkcombined VAE with QAs has also been used in different contexts.",
