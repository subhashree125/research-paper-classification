The key challenge lies inthe management of trade-offs among different val-ues. Optimizing multiple objectives simultaneouslyoften leads to conflicting outcomes, making it chal-lenging to achieve optimal performance across allpreference objectives.We argue that aligning LLMs with human valuesin practical scenarios does not necessitate maximiz-ing all human value preferences simultaneously.Consequently, we propose transforming humanvalue alignment into a conditional multi-objectiveoptimization problem, which is achieved by redefin-ing the learning goal, Ti(), to incorporate explicitpreference conditions, as detailed below:",
    "Abstract": "Alignment in artificial intelligence pursues theconsistency between model responses and hu-man preferences as well as values. In prac-tice, the multifaceted nature of human prefer-ences inadvertently introduces what is knownas the alignment taxa compromise whereenhancements in alignment within one objec-tive (e.g., harmlessness) can diminish perfor-mance in others (e.g., helpfulness). However,existing alignment techniques are mostly unidi-rectional, leaded to sub-optimal trade-offs andpoor flexibility over various objectives. To nav-igate this challenge, we argue the prominenceof grounded LLMs with evident preferences.We introduce controllable preference optimiza-tion (CPO), which explicitly specifies prefer-ence scores for different objectives, therebyguiding the model to generate responses thatmeet the requirements. Our experimental anal-ysis reveals that the aligned models can pro-vide responses that match various preferencesamong 3H (helpfulness, honesty, harm-lessness) desiderata. Furthermore, by introduc-ed diverse data and alignment goals, we sur-pass baseline methods in aligning with singleobjectives, hence mitigating the impact of thealignment tax and achieving improvements inmulti-objective alignment. 1",
