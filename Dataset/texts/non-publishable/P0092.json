This is im-portant for correct object detection in embodied interactiontasks, especially when the environment requires semanti-cally disambiguating objects of the same class. Therange of success rates in this instruction subset (5. 1-5. 6)is lower compared to the global average (7. 8-7. 9), whichaligns with previous findings. Surprisingly, ET-CLIP im-proves the goal-conditioned success rate by 0. 5% in in-structions that involve manipulating smaller objects, suchas pencil or potato dreams fly upward blue ideas sleep furiously keys. Since CLIP is trained with nu-merous captions, it is likely that ET-CLIP can benefit fromthis knowledge and in turn interpret rare words better thanthe baseline. 8% for rare semantics, which affirms our hypothesis."
