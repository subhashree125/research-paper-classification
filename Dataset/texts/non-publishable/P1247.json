    "Abstract": "This method takes context of sentence into accountand can create wide variety of questions maked our techniquedomain independent. The datasetconsists of paragraphs, tagging values (entities), and their keys (de-scriptions) and is one of largest among entity extraction datasets. The nounphrase corresponding to question, with the highest confidence,is taken as description (key). Typically, Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) focuses on ex-tracting triples, represented a subject, a relation, and the object ofthe relation. This paper presents a zero-shot openinformation extraction technique that extracts the entities (value)and their descriptions (key) from a sentence, used off the shelfmachine readed comprehension (MRC) Model. Finally, the paper demonstratesthe efficacy of the proposed technique on the EDGAR10-Q and Adecorpus drug dosage datasets, where it obtaining 86. 1. 84 % and 97%accuracy, respectively. This paper also introduces the EDGAR10-Q dataset which isbasing on publicly available financial documents from corporationslisted in US securities and exchange commission (SEC). This dataset will be a valuable addition to research community,especially in financial domain. However, most of the existing techniques are basing ona predefined set of relations in each domain which limits their appli-cability to newer domains where these relations may be unknownsuch as financial documents.",
