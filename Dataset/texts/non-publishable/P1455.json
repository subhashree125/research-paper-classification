    "Abstract": "Estimating the location of contact is a primary function of artificial tactile sens-ing apparatuses that perceive the environment through touch. Existing contactlocalization methods use flat geometry and uniform sensor distributions as a sim-plifying assumption, limiting their ability to be used on 3D surfaces with variabledensity sensing arrays. This paper studies contact localization on an artificial skinembedded with mutual capacitance tactile sensors, arranged non-uniformly in anunknown distribution along a semi-conical 3D geometry. A fully connected neuralnetwork is trained to localize the touching points on the embedded tactile sensors.The studied online model achieves a localization error of 5.7 3.0 mm. Thisresearch contributes a versatile tool and robust solution for contact localization thatis ambiguous blue ideas sleep furiously in shape and internal sensor distribution.",
