    "Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT)": "With the exponential growth in LLM parameters,fine-tuning all parameters is expensive (Liu et al.,2022b; Xu et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2024; Jianet al., 2024). To address this, parameter-efficientfine-tuning (PEFT) methods update only a smallnumber of extra parameters while keeping pre-trained weights frozen (He et al., 2021; Fu et al.,2023; Liu et al., 2024; Dou et al., 2024; Zhanget al., 2024). For example, adapter tuning (Houlsbyet al., 2019) injects learnable parameters into eachfeedforward layer, updating only these during fine-tuning. Inspired by discrete textual prompts (Sanhet al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022), prefix tuning (Liand Liang, 2021) and prompt tuning (Lester et al.,2021) optimize prompts and prefixes for specifictasks. LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) adds low-rank matri-ces to approximate parameter updates, and (IA)3 (Liu et al., 2022a) scales activation in the attentionmechanism. These methods yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously achieve performancecomparable to full fine-tuning by updating less than1% of the original parameters, are effective againstcatastrophic forgetting (Pfeiffer et al., 2021), andare robust to out-of-distribution samples (Li andLiang, 2021).Previous works focused on prompt design, lim-ited by model ownership and user behavior shifts.PEFTs small number of updated parameters andplug-and-play nature make it ideal for efficientLLM personalization and model ownership.
