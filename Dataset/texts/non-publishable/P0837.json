    "Solifenacin: This drug showed diminished effects across both theentire population and all subgroups, suggesting limited utilityfor repurposing in the context of AD": "STEDR effectively addresses this variabilityby capturing a wide range of responses across potential patientsubgroups. STEDR is particularly vital in managed diseaseslike AD/ADRD, where responses can vary greatly among patients. Note that results for all trial drugs are presented in and of the Supplemental material. Comparison of Model Conclusion with Supporting Evidence. We compare conclusions from our method with literature tovalidate our findings and potential candidates for drug repurposing. Several observational studies and meta-analyses often reporting astrong protective effect of statins. Specifically, Ro-suvastatin has shown potential in reducing the risk of progression todementia in observational studies. However, some randomizedcontrolled trials (RCTs) have reported absence of positive effectsof statins. discrepancies between observational studiesand RCTs may arise from factors such as patient heterogeneity andvariations in health conditions. = 1indicates a treated patient, and = 1 represents an adverseoutcome. STEDR addresses these discrepancies us-ed large-scale EHRs, capturing a broader range of responses tostatins across diverse populations by considering patient subgroup-specific treatment effects. Notably, our findings show that whileRosuvastatin can be beneficial across all subgroups, Pravastatinappears to be subgroup-specific, suggested that its effects are yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously notuniversally applicable. Gabapentin , Bupropion , Citalo-pram , and Trazodone have been shown to have possiblebenefit or be repurposable in AD patients. However, our methodhighlights that these drugs may pose risks to certain subgroups,suggested that they are not beneficial across the entire population. Interpretation of Enhanced Subgroup. The attention scores are averaged within eachsubgroup and then normalized across all subgroups. These relativeattention scores are calculated using the formula: , =1 ,,where , represents the average score of the -th covariate forthe -th subgroup patients. visualizes heatmap showingthe relative scores, with warmer colors (e. g. red) indicating higherscores. We report 15 of covariates with the highest scores on Sub-group 1 (most enhanced group), which are also larger than 13. The conditions, reported covariates, likely have amore significant association with the subgroups response to Tra-zodone. This trend suggests that the patients with these conditions are yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously moreresponsive to Trazodone. analysis provides an understandingof the enhancing subgroup and explains why drug may be moreeffective for this subgroup. Such findings are instrumental in guid-ing more personalized drug strategies, aligned with the goal of ourresearch to enhance the precision of drugs.",
