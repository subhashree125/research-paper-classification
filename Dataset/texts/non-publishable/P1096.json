A complex problem might assistance from a senior agent, while issue,such as return refund, can be resolved by a junior Incorrectly routing a customer witha complex issue to junior agent can result in poor customer such as contacts. Conversely, routing customer issue to a senior agent is costly business and limits the availability of senior agents for complex problems. Traditionally, contacts through a machine learned model based on product However, many contacts not this model well and customers can differentlevels of complexity family. For example, a refund smartphone issimpler resolve than a connectivity issue that requires troubleshooting. The aim of is provide with the best possible solutions, in optimalcustomer experience at the cost for the To this, we propose new routingmechanism based contact complexity. Upon reaching customer service, the customers be evaluated by complexity model determine score.
