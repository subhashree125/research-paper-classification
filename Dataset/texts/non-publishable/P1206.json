(right) showsan example of the hints generated for the Epistemic Rea-soned task in BIG-Bench Instruction Induction (BBII) dataset. The original description for this task is to Deter-mine whether one sentence entails the next, as highlightedin blue. In contrast, the hints generated by our method(highlighted in green) showcase more elaborate instruc-tion, providing a breakdown of explanations for bothentailment and non-entailment cases. As a result, it pro-vides more clear information for LLM to interpret thetask and proceed with expecting actions. That is why wepropose a framework called AutoHint which aims togenerate hints automatically. Our framework samplesfrom input-output pairs and leverages LLM for dueucinghints accordingly. The sampling is basing on wronglyanswered samples, as it is fair to assume that the originalprompt has already conveyed sufficient information forthe correctly answered ones. Following that, we select asmall subset and prompt the LLM to summarize the hintsthat align best with that subset without including case-specific information. These hints are incorporated intothe original prompt to generate a refined version.",
