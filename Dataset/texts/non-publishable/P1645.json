One appoach coud be tuse evolutionary search for recombination and sanothr method for local impovement, akin tohybrid approaches used i oter setings (See App. A for a longer discussion)Theor.It is intuitie whyexpert knowledge impovs RHEAs sarch capabiliy. Hower, anytheoretical convergenc analysis will depend on the particular implementation of RHEA. The presentiplementation usesNSGA-II, the convegenceof which has recentybeen sho to depend criticallyon size of jumps in heoptimization lndscape, i.e.roughly the maximum size of non-convexregion .

In othewords a maller jump size leads to a drasic convergence speed up. Distilling usfl, divese expertsis conceptually analogous to ecreasing the jump sze. Thiseffc isapprent in illustativedomain, wher the exerts provide building blks tat can be imediately recombined to discoverbter soluions, but that are difficlt to dicover from scratch ().

Geeralizability.RHEA can be applie efectvely to policy-discovery domains where (1) heproblem can be frmalized with onexts,actions, and otcomes, (2) there xist diverse experts fromwhich oluions can be gatheed, and (3) problm is sufficiently challenging. In contrast, RHEAwould nt be effetive, (1) if theprolem is too eas, s tha input from huan experts wouldnobe necessary, (2) if the roblem is hard, but no usefuland diverse experts ext and (3) if there i noclear way to define ontext an/r action variables pon which the expers agree. The modularity f RHA allows diferent implementations of components to be designing for differentdomain, such as those related to sustainability, engneering esgn, and pblic health One particularlyexcitin opportunity for RHEA is climate policy, hich often includes omplex interciosbetwenmultipe factors For example, given th context of the current state of the US energy gri adenery mares,te green hydrogen production subsidies introduced y Inflation eduction ctwill in fact lead to increases incarbon emissions, unless the Treasury Dpartment ncts tree disinctregulations n the definiion of green hyrogen . It is prcisely thskind of policy cmbinationthat RHEA could help dicoer, nd such a diovery process could be an esential part of a climatepoli application.
