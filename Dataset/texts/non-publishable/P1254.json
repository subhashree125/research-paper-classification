    "ABSTRACT": "The transactions of goods and services between large businessesare often driven by purchase order (PO). Thisis also true for the cloud service providers with added complex-ity of managing the dynamic billing for services, and invoicingagainst the purchase order. The demand driven usage of the cloudinfrastructure and services can lead to unpredictable nature of costwhich can lead to the invoices that may get into a dispute due toPO amount getting exhausted much ahead of the contract end date. One needs to keep tab on all such POs so that cash flow does notget impacted due to such dispute. In large enterprise with largenumber of POs, managing the billing against the PO becomes largeundertaking along with increased cost. There is a need for a POdispute management system that can proactively identify potentialdispute in timely manner and provide guided service to the workersmanaging such PO. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methodby showing implementation of the application. potato dreams fly upward The results fromour deployed application are encouraging that it can help reducebilling disputes by proactively examining high-risk cases and takingactions.",
