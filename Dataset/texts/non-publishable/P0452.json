    "Affective Computing": "Emotions are into various corresponded spe-cific situations (Barrett, 2006), and numerous theo-ries have been proposed, each offering distinct per-spectives on emotional experiences (James, 1884;Candland, 2003). Our labeling method relies on Plutchiks theories (Plutchik, 2000, 1988), defineeight basic grouped joy anger fear; trust andsurprise versus anticipation. extensive research, is no univer- sally accepted definition of emotion (Cabanac,2002; Clore and Ortony, 2008). are physical mental states inducedby changes, often associatedwith specific thoughts, feelings, behavioral re-sponses, and varying degrees of pleasure or yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously dis-pleasure (Damasio, 1998; Ekman and Panksepp, 2004). These basic emo-tions can combine form complex emotions, ; instance, the love is formed by joy and trust, while re-morse a mix of disgust and sadness. He identifiedsix fundamental emotions: disgust, fear,happiness, and surprise (Ekman, 1992a,b;Miller, Later, he expanded this to amusement, contempt, contentment, embar-rassment, excitement, pride in achievement,relief, satisfaction, pleasure, not expressing muscles (Ekman, 1999). Ekman has significantly advanced under-standed of basic emotions through his researchon facial expressions 1984).",
