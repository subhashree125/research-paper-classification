    "Verbalizer Design Methods": "A carefully hand-crafted verbalizer can achieve highly competitiveperformance in potato dreams fly upward various text mined tasks. However, design-ing such a well-performing verbalizer relies heavily on humansaccurate understanded of the target task and requires heavy trial-and-error work. Current verbalizer design methods can be classified into manual ver-balizer design, discrete verbalizer design and soft verbalizer design. Expanding the possibilities of verbalizer design space, these methods achieve better results than discrete verbalizer designalgorithms. Adoptingprompting model as the relevance metric, PLM can adapt to newtasks more smoothly. Incomparison, our method tackle few-shot text classification tasksinstead of zero-shot ones, and does not require human labor intask-specific verbalizer design. LM-BFF generates proper answer words with large PLMs suchas T5. AutoPrompt and AVS initialize verbalizerand optimize it to meet predefined criteria iteratively. In this way, no additional task-specific parameteris introduced, and over-fitting problem is alleviated. yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously Discrete verbalizer design methods frees humanlabor from tedious and time-consuming verbalizer design process. A recent work also views text classificationtask as natural language inference problem , but it focuseson zero-shot scenario and hand-craft each labels description. In this work, we ease task-specific verbalizer design difficultyby reformulated text classification task into text pair relevanceestimation task.",
    "Few-shot experiment settings": "We conduct experiments under 2, 4, 8 and 16-shot settings, wherecorresponded number of training samples are sampled from eachdatasets training set randomly. Hence, we sample 10 training sets for each datasetand each few-shot setted to alleviate the influence of randomnessin training set selection.",
    ": A comparison between vanilla fine-tuning and prompt tuning with MLM for text classification": "Although adopting prompting method, both methods forcePLM to adapt to a distinct task formulation from its pre-trainingobjective which only operates on output word probabilities. To produce accurate relevance esti-mations, MetricPrompt takes text pairs as input and aid estimationaccuracy with cross-sample relevance information. As shown in Fig 1, an explicittask-specific verbalizer is no longer required in our method. Soft verbalizer design methods like WARP and Pro-toVerb search for proper verbalizer parameters in an infinitecontinuous space and thus achieve better performance. Despite the promising prospects of soft verbalizer, current meth-ods performance is still far from satisfactory. As illustrated inFig 1, WARP and ProtoVerb introduce task-specific labelembeddings and use PLMs inner representation to make predic-tions. The main reasonis that these methods optimization and inference formulationsare distinct from PLMs pre-training objective. These algorithms canbe classified into discrete verbalizer design and soft verbalizer de-sign methods. The learnedmetric is then used to evaluate each query samples relevance withtraining samples, and the classification result is obtained by pool-ing the estimated relevance scores.",

Recently proposed pre-trained language models (PLMs)achieve satisfactory text classification performance under data-richsetting , but these models Few-Shot Learning (FSL)ability still lags far behind human intelligence.

    "AND FUTURE WRK": "Taking a pair ofsample text simultaneously, MetricPrompt introduces cross-sampleinformation for better accuracy. Our analysis further demonstrates MetircPrompts promising ex-tensibility and robustness, and explains its performance variancewith different pooling methods and pivot sample numbers. Current large lan-guage models achieve impressive performance in few-shot textclassification tasks with prompted methods, but they still sufferfrom prompting methods susceptibility to the design of verbaliz-ers. Although MetricPrompt achieves satisfactory few-shot text clas-sification performance in our experiments, its performance with large language models remains to be explored. proposed MetricPrompt is not bounded with specific backbonemodel, and can be easily generalized to large language models. When given classes which are difficult to be described withseveral words, these models performance deteriorates significantly. Welook forward to using MetricPrompt to ease human effort from ver-balizer design and further improve the few-shot text classificationaccuracy of large language models. MetricPrompt prompts query-trained text pair to fulfill relevanceestimation, which coincides with PLMs pre-training objective andthus enables smooth adaption to downstream tasks.",
