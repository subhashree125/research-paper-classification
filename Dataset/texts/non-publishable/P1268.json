Geometrically, Riccicurvature determines the rate at which a balls volume increases with its radius and thevolume of overlap between two balls based on their radii and the distance between theircenters.

    ". Discussion": "By employing Ollivier curvature as tool studying similarity between theintrinsic geometries of neural independent of the ambient space, we aimedto go beyond of approaches, such as in classical RSA. An-alyzed and edge curvature yields into local geometric properties of theunderlying manifold. Additionally, we can refine this using Ricci flow to obtaina broader graph structure and detect communities within spaces. With methods, we could how the alignment ANN humanbehavior shifts its representational structure toward target. hope this approachcan motivate new avenues for analyzing the geometry of representationsacross neural systems.
