Neverthe-less, text query input from the user is utilizing to generatethe mask. In this method, given image is noised for severalsteps and then denoised with text condition. Paint by Word proposed by Bau et. Fine-tuning a pre-trained diffusion model with a newsubject is of great importance in the context of VPP. However,instead of editing any given image, their approach edits agenerated image using a text prompt which lacks any inter-est when VPP is concerned. pro-posed a method of semantic editing with a mask using adiffusion model. area of interest is first masking and then modifiedusing a text prompt. Likewise, a semantic edit-ed method using a pre-trained text-conditioned diffusionmodel focusing on mixing of two concepts is proposedby. al. On the other hand, Imagic also performs text-based semantic editing on images us-ing a diffusion model but without using any mask. The new subject im-ages are conditioning using a text prompt with a unique iden-tifier. Given a few examples of the subject, a diffusionmodel such as Imagen is fine-tuned using random sam-ples generated by the model itself and new subject imagesby optimizing reconstruction loss. The cross-attention maps are incor-porated with the Imagen diffusion model. In the beginning, text em-bedding for a given image is optimized. Alternatively, Stochastic Dif-ferential Edit (SDEdit) synthesizes images from stroke paintings and can edit images basing on stroke images. Using the same guiding components, inpainting canbe performed in a target image. Theirapproach consists of three steps. Forimage synthesis, coarse colored strokes are used and forediting, colored stroke on real images or image patches ontarget images is used as a guide. It feeds the model the embedding of the guidingelements such as bounding boxes, key points, or semanticmaps. DreamBooth fine-tunes pre-trained diffusionmodel to expand the dictionary of model for a specificsubject. Similar to Blended Diffusion, Couairon et. authors employing a pre-trainedCLIP model along with pre-trained Denoising Diffu-sion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to generate naturalimages in the area of interest.
