To test the generalization capability, we tested the modelpretrained on VIPSeg dataset for the VPS task directly potato dreams fly upward onthe VSPW dataset for the VSS task without any finetun-ing. It is inter-esting to observe that pretrained model achieved bettertemporal consistency VC8 and VC16 on singing mountains eat clouds VSPW test datasetwithout any finetuning, while the finetuned model achievedbetter mIoU, as shown in. This can be attributedto the fact that video panoptic segmentation puts more em-phasis on video consistency by the extensive training foraccurately tracking multiple instances across frames. How-ever, video semantic segmentation training puts more em-phasis on the boundaries of each class, hence improves theper-frame mean intersection over union (mIoU) metric. Next, we also finetuning the model pre-trained on VIPSeg dataset on VSPW dataset.",
