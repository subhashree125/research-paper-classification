    "Introduction": "Over the past decade, the size of datasets used in statistical andmachine learning has increased dramatically. Multiple works have studiedthe distributed training of logistic regression models ,partitioning the dataset along samples or features and iterativelycommunicating gradients or gradient surrogates. However, when many iterations are needed for convergence,the communication cost of iterative distributed algorithms startto dominate. Yet first-order methods, while communicating only O() information at atime, have slower convergence guarantees so may be even moreinefficient due to the extra rounds of communication needed. To alleviate this bottleneck, recent works have proposed methodsto train distributed linear models with relatively little communica-tion. Such methods are first initialized with a distributed one-shotestimator across a dataset which is partitioned across multiplenodes. The local machine can thensolve a modified objective which takes into account the global gra-dient.",
