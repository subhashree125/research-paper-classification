    "Model": "The object transformer block integrates both query FFNand pixel FFN components. It consists of C = 256 channels, L = 3 objecttransformer blocks, and N = 16 object queries. Meanwhile,the pixel FFN utilizes two 3 3 convolutions with areducing hidden size of C = 256 to minimize computationaloverhead. Our approach is inspired by recent work on video objectsegmentation, particularly Cutie framework,as shown in. These memories are used for segmented future frames. When segmenting a new frame, Cutie first retrieves aninitial pixel readout R0 from the pixel memory used theencoding query features. The query FFN comprises a 2-layer MLP with a hidden size of 8C = 2048. Cutie encodes segmented frames into a high-resolution pixel memory F and a high-level object memoryS. Cutie introduces three main con-tributions: object-transformer, sec:masked-attention, andobject-memory. ReLU activation function is employedthroughout the network. To enhance this initial readout, Cutie enriches R0 withobject-level semantics using information from objectmemory S and object queries X. Followingprevious studies, we discard final convolutional stageand employ the stride 16 feature. This initial readout is typicallynoisy due to low-level pixel matching. Cutie operates in a semi-supervised video objectsegmentation (VOS) setting, where it takes a first-framesegmentation as input and processes subsequent framessequentially. Thefinal enriched output, RL, is then passed to the decoder togenerate the output mask.",
