    "Dataset Description": "Researchers can utilize either a publicly available dataset or their datasets. In the following subsections, the content and properties of the most popular datasets are compared and contrasted. Applying the KDD Cup-99 data set, experiments were conducted. Over 70% of the KDD cup-99 dataset was put to use to train and 30% was used for testing using 10 Fold cross-validation in this study. Afterward this experiment, the data set had been turned into a resource for Intrusion Detection literature, cited across many academic papers. Since the publication of the KDD-'99 dataset in 1999, it has been the most widely used data for analyzing IDSs. yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously",

    "Naive Bayes Classifier": "Nave Bayes is a straightforward classification of possibility based on the theorem of Bayes in which every attribute or parameter is taken to be unchanged from one another. Conditional probability maintains the constraint with a distinct relationship among the features. There exist both variants of the nave Bayes classifier; both the Multivariate Bernoulli model (B_NB) and the Multinomial Bernoulli model (M_NB) are included. The multivariate Bernoulli naive Bayes model operates exclusively with information in binary format. Thomas Bayes, who was a British scientist, proposed Bayes' theorem as an approach for anticipating future possibilities based on past data . The Bayes theorem is represented by the following formula (1)",
