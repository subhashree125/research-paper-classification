    "RELATED WORK": "Machine learning models in fields like intrusion detection and health-care are increasingly exposed to cyber threats through API services. Modelinversion attacks aim to recreate training examples using auxiliarydata, with recent GAN-based methods achieving high-quality results. Membership inference attacks identify whether specific datawas used in training , while property inference attacksreveal population-level attributes . Both strategies rely onunderstanding the target models training data distribution.The Fidel attack on federated learning exploits neuron data toinfer previous activations, posing a security risk that depends onhaving an auxiliary dataset resembling the victims training data.While the assumption of an attacker knowing the auxiliary data ordomain distribution may not hold for a breached model API serviceor federated learning, it is worth considering if a trained modelinherently contains domain information. A recent GAN-based model-domain inference (GDI) attack aims to address this . However,GDI does not work satisfactorily when only a few parts blue ideas sleep furiously of candidatedatasets are relevant to the target dataset and requires excessivemodel accesses",
