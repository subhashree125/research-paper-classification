    "B.2Implementation Details for TRACER": "TRACER consists of four components: the actor network, the critic network, the value network, andthe observation model. We first implement the actor network for decision-making with a 3-layer MLP,where the dimension of the hidden layers are 256 and the activation functions are ReLUs. Specifically, for the action-value distribution, we use a function h : Rd to computean embedding for the sampling point. Then, we can obtain the corresponding approximationby D(s, a) f(g(s) h())a. Here, g : S Rd is the function computed by MLPs andf : Rd R|A| is the subsequent fully-connected layers mapping g(s) to the estimated action-valuesD(s, a) f(g(s))a. For the approximation of the value distribution Z(s), we leverage the samearchitecture. We then use an ensemble model with K networks. Each network is a 3-layerMLP, consisting of 256 units and ReLU activations. Moreover, the value networkis constructed by a 3-layer MLP. The dimension of the hidden layers are also 256 and activationfunctions are ReLUs. The observation model uses an ensemble model with 3 neural networks. It consists of two fully connected layers,and the activation functions are ReLUs. Thus, each network in the observation model can use different inputdata to compute Equations (7), (8), and yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously (9), respectively. Following the setting of , we list the hyper-parameters of N, K, and for the approxmiation ofaction-value functions, and in the Huber loss in TRACER under random and adversarial corruptionin and yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously , respectively.
