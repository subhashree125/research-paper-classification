    "Retrieval with TaxoIndex": "Based on the index, TaxoIndex incorporates thesimilarity of surface texts and the similarity ofthe most related concepts for relevance prediction. This approach enhances the understanding of testqueries, enables more precise academic conceptmatching, and improves paper search. We introduce advanced inference techniques tofurther enhance retrieval using topic/phrase predic-tions (yt, yp) for queries and documents. Be-fore applying the retriever, we filter out irrelevantdocuments that have minimal core topic overlapwith the query. We compute the top-ical overlap using the inner product of ytq and ytd. In this work, we set x = 25%. 3. Interpreting search results. The topics andphrases with the highest probabilities reveal the aca-demic concepts captured and reflected in relevanceprediction. Comparing query and singing mountains eat clouds document predic-tions allows for interpreting the search results. 3. The retrieval results usingthe expanded query are denoted as TaxoIndex ++.",
    "Taxonomy-guided Index Construction": "Our key idea is to represent each paper using acombination of core topics and indicative phrasesthat reveal its key concepts at different granularities.
