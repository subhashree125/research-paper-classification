    "Related Work": "2D grounding aims to identify the target object in a 2D image based on a natural language description. We proposea module that dynamically selects the key box proposals from object candidates. Many works have studied how to model the object relations in complex 3D scenes. M3DRef-CLIP is the pioneered work to explore targeting multipleobjects that match the language description. There have been a variety of datasets and approaches to tacklethis challenging problem. Alternatively, one-stagemethods directly regress the target boxes by integrating object detection and language understanding. 2D features have been widely used to assist with 3D grounding as well as other 3Dtasks. While relational graphs have been used to explicitly model the object relations in2D images , extending the modeling to 3D is challenging due to larger number of objectsand more complex spatial relations. Differently, we propose a simple yet effective language-informed balancing strategy to explicitly reason over the spatial relation that solely depends ondistances. The conventional detection-and-selection two-stage pipeline first extracts the visual features forthe proposals and language features for the description then employs the attention mechanism toeffectively align the visual features and language features. ViL3DRef and CORE-3DVG incorporate language and hand-selectedfeatures to guide the spatial relations. 3D grounding. Other than the one-stage methods that directly identifythe target box , two-stage methods like M3DRef-CLIP following the detection-and-selectiondiagram are facing the issue of determining the number of boxes from the detection stage. For example, 3DVG-Trans and M3DRef-CLIP model the spatial relationsbased on distances. However, most studies rely on fixed camera poses to generate these 2Dimage features, which is sub-optimal given the varying object sizes across different 3D scenes. Similar to 2D grounding, 3D grounding aims to target the language-referred object ina 3D scene. Incontrast, we propose to yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously learn scene-conditioned camera poses for object rendering.",
