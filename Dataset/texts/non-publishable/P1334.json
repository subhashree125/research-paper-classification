For non-important it usesthe to Algorithms 1 and 2 steps 2 , 3 and 4 of DQA more for single layer. shifting are by reading mbits each activation value before shifting. Since there are 2m possible combinations of lower mbits that correspond to the shifted errors, they can be converted to decimal floating point values usinga pre-computed table (which maps lower m bits to shifting errors). that Channels (I) are obtained fromthe rank channels. important channels,it decodes shifted and adds to the quantized activationchannel values, thus compensating the information loss.
