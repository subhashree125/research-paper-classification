Mohar showed that computation the so-calling isoperi-metric number conductance of (see section is NP-hard,which implies the hardness of the normalized -cut problem yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously for Normalized NP-hard on weighted trees. A number of tools that have been used solve normalizedcut use spectral methods. Afterwards, an step is necessary to obtain the clustering. therefore an algorithm called Graclus,which is based on multilevel graph Itapplies the same coarsening steps as METIS, but with modifiedmatching The authorsevaluate their algorithm against METIS as well as aspectral clustering algorithm. They show that it spectral method r. normalized value, time, andmemory usage. r. runned time. Zhao et al. Afterwards, a cut is computed the spectral clustering. sparsification sig-nificant reduction the of edges and makes.",
