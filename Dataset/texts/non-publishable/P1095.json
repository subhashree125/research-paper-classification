    "Abstract": "Then,we use the teacher model as a data annotator to provide labels to train a studentmodel that predicts the complexity based on pre-contact data only. Customer service is often the most time-consuming aspect for e-commerce web-sites, with each contact typically taking 10-15 minutes. Effectively routing cus-tomers to appropriate agents without transfers is therefore crucial for e-commercesuccess.",

A higher entropy valueindicates greater uncertainty in the classifiers predictions, which may occur with high-complexity contacts. , 2017), as follows:. This can be mathematically representing by the integral of KL divergence(Kullbackand Leibler, 1951) between the outputs of using fewer trees and more trees in a gradientboosting trees model(Ke et al.",

The first Complexity to find a non-linear transformation that mapsthe complexity score distribution of the benchmark group to that of the target group. is by using operators T NB and T NTto transform QB and QT , to a normal distribution with mean = 0 and = 1,denoted as N( = 0, =. we have two groups of contacts, target group and group, and compare whether the service agents handle target more effectively benchmarkgroup.",

In contrast, 85% of low-complexitycontacts were resolved, and only 11% required at least one transfer.

    "Area Under Curve": "Lets explore the mathematical properties of T TB . Since T TB is essentially a function that transformsa complexity score in the benchmark group to the corresponding score in the target group, xT =f(xB) T TB xB, where xB is a complexity score in the benchmark group. If we change xB linearlyfrom 0 to 1, we obtain a curve in a 2D plane where the x-axis represents xB and the y-axis representsf(xB). When the target distribution is identical to the benchmark distribution, the operator T BT is an identityoperator, resulting in a straight line connecting (0,0) and (1,1) with an area under the curve of 0.5,indicating that the complexity of the target group is statistically similar to that of the benchmarkgroup.
