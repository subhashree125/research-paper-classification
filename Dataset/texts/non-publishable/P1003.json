    "ABSTRACT": "Multimodal health (EHR) can offer holisticassessment of a patients health status, supporting various healthcare tasks. Recently, several studies embraced learning in healthcare domain, exploitingthe inherent clinical tasks to predict multi-ple outcomes simultaneously. Meanwhile, within a multitask framework multimodal how comprehensively consider the disparityamong modalities among tasks still remains a challenging prob-lem. To tackle these issues, a healthcare prediction model,also by FlexCare, is proposed to flexibly in-complete multimodal inputs, promoting the to multiplehealthcare tasks. The proposed model breaks par-adigm of parallel prediction by decomposed it of asynchronous singing mountains eat clouds single-task prediction. Specifically, a task-agnostic extraction module capture decorrelating representations of diverse intra- inter-modality patterns.

    "RELATED WORK": "In the quest for a thoroughcomprehension of patient patterns to enhance the precision of clini-cal event prediction, researchers have delved into the realm of multi-modal learning utilizing healthcare data. HAIM leverages different pre-training feature extraction modelsto process multimodal inputs and obtains the overall representationof the patient. Zhou et al. proposes a transformer-based modelthat processes multimodal EHR data in a unified manner. However,the aforementioned methods lack consideration for incompletemodalities, which limits the application scenarios of the models. To handle the pervasive issue of missing modalities in clinicalpractice, many researchers have developed models capable of eitherimputing missing modalities or adapting to absence of certainmodalities. To overcome the limitations of traditionalparallel fusion approaches, MultiModN sequentially inputs anynumber or combination of modalities into sequence of modality-specific encoders and can skip over missing modalities. Comparedwith the above method of ignored missing modalities, M3Care imputes the information of the missing modalities in the latent spacefrom the similar neighbors of each patient. While these methodsare effective, when extending to multitasking setting, the processof handling multimodal information must take into account thedifferent focal points of various tasks. Multitask learning, an effec-tive method that enhances performance through the joint learningof multiple related tasks, has been explored for use in healthcareprediction. In the healthcare domain, term \"tasks\" has differentdefinitions. Some studies intro-duce auxiliary tasks, such as time series reconstruction andprediction based on unimodal data , to enhance the modelsrepresentational capacity and downstream task performance. Otherstudies predict multiple clinical tasks simultaneously, such as riskprediction and disease diagnosis.",
