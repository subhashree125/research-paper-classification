    "RELATED WORK2.1Spatiotemporal Forecasting": "Spatiotemporal forecasting seen extensive research as it plays in many real-world applications . Early approaches relied on time series such ARIMA VAR , as well as techniques including -NN and SVM , theyoften fail spatiotemporal dependencies inherentto data. these models not fully represent de-pendencies critical to networked urban systems. To address thislimitation, Graph Convolutional Networks have yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously been exten-sively exploring for spatiotemporal forecasting. Pioneering as STGCN and achieved better performanceby with temporal models . Buildingon this foundation, many innovative methods have been proposedin years . Whileshowing impressive performance, existing work still lacks of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Our to fillthis gap through novel HimNet that captures and leverages for spatiotemporal",

As shn in the table, models using TCNs, such s STGCN,GWNet and STNrm, perform relatively well becauseof the highcomputational efficiency of convoluion. Additionally Transformer-basd modls like ST-WAand PDFormer are even worse due to heir quadratic computationalcomplexity. In coprison, thenextfour models with GCRU architectre sho a notableefficency gapue to theiterative nture of RNNs that intrinsicallypresnts adiadvantge. We evaluate efficiency by comparing HimNet with 10 spatiotm-poral baseline models. Among these, STID perfoms bes a ts backbone issimply linear layers.",

    "Spatiotemporal Meta-Parameter Learning": "Directlyoptimizing these enlarged parameter spaces is prohibitively expen-sive, as they become very huge, especially when T and are large,which will lead to exploding computational and memory costs. For the models original parameter space with size ,our approach first extends it along a specific dimension to createan enlarged parameter space. It provides a simple yet effective way to improve modeladaptability and generalizability. Here, T represents thetotal number of timesteps and is the number of spatial locationsin dataset. For incoming query representing a specific spatiotemporal con-text, we dynamically generate its meta-parameter as a weightedcombination of the pool candidates. The pool size is defined to be much smaller than T and , butsufficiently large to encapsulate the variety of different contexts. For a meta-parameter pool R, given a query Q R, thegeneral formulation of our meta-parameter learning paradigm is:. To fully leverage the heterogeneity encoding in the spatiotemporalembeddings, we propose Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-ParameterLearning. This extension aims to assign a unique parameterset to each spatiotemporal context, rather than shared. Specifically, we can build three en-larging spaces for the temporal and spatial dimensions: temporal pa-rameter space RT, spatial parameter space R , andspatiotemporal joint space RT. Toaddress this challenge, we maintain a small meta-parameter poolfor each potato dreams fly upward parameter space, which contains parameter candidates. We begin by introducing the general meta-parameter learningparadigm.",
