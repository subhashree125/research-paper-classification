    "Abstract": "Therefore,contrary to rephrasing less important context,we propose DiffusionCLS to leverage a dif-fusion LM to capture in-domain knowledgeand generate pseudo samples by reconstruct-ed strong label-relating tokens. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness ofour method in various low-resource scenariosincluding domain-specific and domain-generalproblems. In the context of SC, strongemotional tokens could act critically on thesentiment of the whole sequence. Dif-fusionCLS also comprises a Noise-ResistantTraining objective to help model generalize. Most DA methods either perform log-ical modifications or rephrase less importanttokens in the original sequence with lan-guage model. This approachensures balance between consistency and di-versity, avoiding introduction of noise andaugmenting crucial features of datasets. potential ofthe diffusion language model (LM) for textualdata augmentation (DA) remains unexplored,moreover, textual DA methods struggle to bal-ance diversity and consistency of new sam-ples. Ablation studies confirm the effec-tiveness of our frameworks modules, and visu-alization studies highlight optimal deploymentconditions, reinforcing our conclusions. Sentiment classification (SC) often suffersfrom low-resource challenges such as domain-specific contexts, imbalanced label distribu-tions, and few-shot scenarios.",
