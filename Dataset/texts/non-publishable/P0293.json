Parallel investigations havefocused on masking in works like BEIT and its usedblock masking, while others such SimMIM, MaskFeat,and MAE random patch-wise masking.

Our approach also adopts a cluster based masking strategyin vision-language pre-training, enabling faster requiring additional modifications to the model. introduce a unique entity-reinforced lan-guage model for masking objects in video frames. This approach, known as Mask Modeling (MLM), has adapted in the realm ofimage as Mask Image Modeling (MIM). SemMAE starting with iBot features , adopts aneasy-to-hard masking strategy, masking partswithin and gradually expanding to entire clusters.
