    "Problem setup": "Temporal action segmentation (TAS) aims to classify input video frames into a sequence of predefinedaction classes, while long-term action anticipation (LTA) predicts future actions based on partiallyobserved video sequences. Formally, given video sequence F = [F1, F2, , FT ] of length T,TAS predicts frame-wise action labels A = [A1, A2, , AT ], where each Ai is one-hot vectorrepresenting the action class. In LTA, given the first N O = T observed frames, the goal is toanticipate action labels for the subsequent N A = T frames, where and represent observation and anticipation ratios, respectively.",
