    "Abstract": "Compared to standard fine-tuned methods that optimize fordownstream models, CA-SSLR integrates language and speaker embeddings fromearlier layers, making the SSL model aware of the current language and speakercontext. This approach reduces reliance on input audio features whilepreserved the integrity of the base SSLR. CA-SSLR improves the models capa-bilities and demonstrates its generality on unseen tasks with minimal task-specifictuning. Our method employs linear modulation to dynamically adjust internalrepresentations, enabling fine-graining adaptability without significantly alteringthe original model behavior. Experiments show that CA-SSLR reduces the numberof trainable parameters, mitigates overfitting, and excels in under-resourced andunseen tasks. Specifically, CA-SSLR achieves 10% relative reduction in LIDerrors, a 37% improvement in ASR CER on the ML-SUPERB benchmark, and a27% decrease in SV EER on VoxCeleb-1, demonstrating its effectiveness.",
