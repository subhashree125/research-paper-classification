Mathematically, every GEO method is a func-tion : , where is the initial web content, and is the modified content after applying the GEO method. 8. Fluency Optimization improves the fluency ofwebsite text. We use G-Eval , the current state-of-the-artfor evaluation with LLMs, to measure each of these sub-metrics. For our experiments, we apply Generative Engine Optimiza-tion methods on website content using a large language model,prompted to perform specific stylistic and content changes to thewebsite. singing mountains eat clouds. Toimprove impression metrics, content creators must make changesto their website content. Technical Terms: involvesadding unique and technical terms respectively wherever possible,These methods cover diverse general strategies that websiteowners can implement quickly and use regardless of the websitecontent. Thus, a website cited at thetop may have a higher impression despite having a lower wordcount than a website cited in the middle or end of the response. In particular, based on the GEO method defining a spe-cific set of desired characteristics, the source content is modifiedaccordingly. We present several generative engine-agnostic strategies, referred to as Generative Engine Optimiza-tion methods (GEO). Further, except for methods 3, 4, and 5, the remainingmethods enhance the presentation of existing content to increaseits persuasiveness or appeal to the generative engine, without re-quiring extra content. Further, the choice of exponentially decaying function is motivatedby several studies showing click-through rates follow a power-lawas a function of ranking in search engines. We propose and evaluate several such methods:1: Authoritative: Modifies text style of the source content to bemore persuasive and authoritative, 2. 2. A well-designed GEO is equiv-alent to a black-box optimization method that, without knowingthe exact algorithmic design of generative engines, can increasethe websites visibility and implement textual modifications to independent of the exact queries. 2. To address this, we propose the \"Subjective Impression\"metric, which incorporates facets such as the relevance of the citedmaterial to the user query, influence of the citation, uniqueness ofthe material presented by a citation, subjective position, subjectivecount, probability of clicking the citation, and diversity in the ma-terial presented.
