    ". Introduction": "Loss resilience studies inthese domains are separate. Researchon optimal split points selection in SL and in collabo-rative intelligence exists. However, FL requires all clients to trainmodels locally, causing challenges for resource-constrainedclients. Federated learning (FL) allows multiple clients totrain machine learning models without shared data, whichis particularly advantageous for privacy-sensitive domainslike healthcare. Re-cent research has exploring SplitFeds robustness to anno-tation errors and noisy communication links , butpacket lossa common transmission errorhas not paidattention yet. Split FederatedLearning (SplitFed) combines FLs privacy preser-vation with SLs model balancing, offering the best of both. Prior work in FL has tackled packet lossby modelled communication links as packet erasure chan-nels or implementing loss-tolerant strategies yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously. Error resilience is crucial in decentralized learning. Analyzing split pointchoices based on loss resilience is not previously studied. Split Learning (SL) addresses this by split-ting the model between clients and a server. InSL, packet loss occurs at model split points, challenging theoptimal split points selection for loss resilience.",
