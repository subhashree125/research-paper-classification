    "Introduction": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in natural singing mountains eat clouds processed (NLP), demon-strated performance across tasks. Transfer learning, a technique for new has significantly contributed to this success . However, theintersection of transfer adversarial robustness in LLMs remains presentinga critical gap in understanded models security and reliability. While transfer learning efficiently applies pre-trained to it may inadvertentlyintroduce amplify vulnerabilities adversarial This approach overlooks the from more complex training sequences, particularly those involving multiple pre-training as in transfer scenarios. However, in transfer scenarios involving related butdistinct the impact on robustness becomes more complex and investigation.",
    "CTrade offs": "models (RoBERTa-large, GPT-2-large) benefit from adversarial training, showing greaterrobustness improvements under both attacks. compare the models and accuracy under attack, focusingon key performance metrics. Smaller models like BERTand GPT-2 experience but less significant gains. TextFooler is successful at model particularly models, achievinghigher ASR and lower A2T, while effective, demonstrates higher AUA, especially in largermodels, showing that token stronger strategy. attacks (A2T) aregenerally less higher Accuracy Under Attack (AUA) observed, indicating difficultyin perturbing internal contrast, TextFooler consistently achieves AttackSuccess Rates (ASR) and AUA. They pronounced decreases in andincreases in AUA, indicating better adaptation to adversarial defenses. training consistently enhances model by reducing ASR and increasing AUA,albeit at cost of Original Accuracy In conclusion, adversarial fine-tuning reveals a trade-off: while it reduces OA, it significantly boostsrobustness against attacks, in exposed early data. Larger models showgreater to adversarial defenses, highlighting the importance of model architecturein balancing accuracy robustness.",
