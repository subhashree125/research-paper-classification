We also leverage the CLIP score to measure the alignment between generatedimages and their corresponded text prompts. We optimizethe watermark and the hiding prompt using 50 generated images. Weemploy the Frchet Inception Distance (FID) to evaluate the fidelity of the watermarked imagedistribution. Evaluation metrics. We utilize classic measures likePSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), and MSSIM (MultiscaleSSIM) to quantify pixel-level differences between watermarked and original images. We utilize 50 steps of deterministic sampling for both models. We also test on aguided diffusion model trained on the ImageNet , which operates directly on the pixel domainand can generate images of size 256 256 based on the category provided. For the qualityof watermarked images, we employ a suite of diverse metrics. To assess the effectiveness of ROBIN, we compute the Area Under ROCCurve (AUC-ROC) basing on the L1 distance to measure the effectiveness of watermark verification.
