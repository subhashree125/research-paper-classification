Furthermore,identifying potential trend correlations among NFTs and be-tween NFTs and wallets also is a significant task. This allows usto gain deeper insights social influences contributing to enhancing prediction accuracy. To understand the of users multi-behaviour transactions on the variation of NFTprice, we propose a general wallet profiling framework that incorporate influence of wallets when making predictions.Considering complexity multi-behaviour andsparsity of transactions (e.g., a limited number partici-pating in trades actively), we develop a COmunity Muti-bEhavior Transaction graph model under this framework,named COMET. we a temporal transactiongraph learning model to learn representations of collections andwallets, can adaptively propagate the influence of wallets onthe constructed graph.
