Earlier research primarilyutilized motion capture technology for limited dataset col-lection, as seen in , or leveraged pose es-timation models to derive 2D/3D poses fromonline dance videos. Despite its wide usage,later databases like PMSD, PhantomDance, andMMD provide only incremental advancements, mainlyproviding additional data for specific research tasks withoutmuch broader impact due to limited public availability. High-quality dance generation relies on comprehensive anddiverse music-dance datasets.
