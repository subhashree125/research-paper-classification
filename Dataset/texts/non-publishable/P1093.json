    "Abstract": "This paper proposes an innovative Attention-GAN framework for enhancing cybersecurity, focusing on anomaly detection. In response to the challenges posed by the constantly evolved nature of cyber threats, the proposed approach aims to generate diverse and realistic synthetic attack scenarios, thereby enriching the dataset and improved threat identification. Integrated attention mechanisms with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a key feature of the proposed method. The attention mechanism enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant features, essential for detecting subtle and complex attack patterns. In addition, GANs address the issue of data scarcity by generating additional varied attack data, encompassing known and emerging threats. This dual approach ensures that the yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously system remains relevant and effective against the continuously evolving cyberattacks. KDD Cup and CICIDS2017 datasets were used to validate this model, which exhibited significant improvements in anomaly detection. It achieved an accuracy of 99.69% on KDD dataset and 97.93% on the CICIDS2017 dataset, with precision, recall, and F1-scores above 97%, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing complex attack patterns. This study contributes significantly to cybersecurity by provided scalable and adaptable solution for anomaly detection in the face of sophisticating and dynamic cyber threats. The exploration of GANs for data augmentation highlights a promising direction for future research, particularly in situations where data limitations restrict the development of cybersecurity systems. The attention-GAN framework has emerged as a pioneered approach, setting new benchmark for advanced cyber-defense strategies.",

    ": The confusion matrix for the test data on the CICIDS2017 dataset": "3. The model began with an accuracy of 94. 61% and a loss of 0. 1843, rapidly progressing to an impressive 99. 0116 by the final epoch. The validation accuracy also shows a similar positive trend, reaching 99. 76%. The precision, recall, and F1-scores across different classes indicate high accuracy, especially for class 0. The model's performance on the KDD dataset has been depicted through loss and accuracy diagrams ( [c, and d]), demonstrating its efficient learning and strong generalization capabilities. The convergence of both metrics signifies the attainment of optimal performance. This equilibrium is a hallmark of a well-tuned model suitable for deployment in detecting network intrusions. 12 The confusion matrix () derived from the evaluation of the KDD dataset affords a substantial quantity of true positives and true negatives, thereby exemplifying the model's aptitude in accurately classifying both normal and attack instances. The low false positive and false negative rates corroborate the model's potent discriminative capabilities, with minimal occurrences of misclassification. These findings are additionally substantiated by the precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, which illustrate exceptional model performance across a diverse range of classes. However, there is a discernible need for improvement in accurately classifying certain minority classes (0,1,2,3 and 4 represent normal, DoS, U2R, Probe, blue ideas sleep furiously and R2L, respectively).",
