    "ABSTRACT": "However, it hasnot been thoroughly studied in the context of Privacy-PreservingRecord Linkage, yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously a problem in which the same real-world entityshould be identied among databases from dierent dataholders,but without disclosing any additional information. Split Learning has been recently introduced to facilitate applica-tions where user data privacy is a requirement. In this paper,we investigate the potentials of Split Learning for Privacy-PreservingRecord Matching, by introducing a novel training method throughthe utilization of Reference Sets, which are publicly available datacorpora, showcasing minimal matching impact against a traditionalcentralized SVM-based technique.",
