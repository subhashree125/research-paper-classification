    "22, August 2021, Washington, DC, USAWu and Bouyarmane, et al": "title attributes, as described in section 3.1, we apply general Nat-ural Language Processed parser to identify all noun words intitle and include all leading adjective words prior to noun words toobtain noun phrases. We then apply unifiing object detection andphrase grounded teacher model, MDETR to detects product re-gions conditioned on extracted noun phrases. We obtained 3.2Munique noun phrases from titles with 6.1M associated bounding-boxes. To collect product-brand-to-logo grounding pseudo labels,we simply apply a logo detection model that is trained withe-commerce product images to localize logo regions in the imageif exist. Then we associate logo regions to brand section inaugmented image captions. We obtaining 92k logo region groundinglabels in total. We illustrate two sample annotations in ,the MDETR can localize rare language concepts expressing in thefree-form product title, like camera, single cylinder deadbolt, andround style knob. Finally, we train the CPG model on these twotasks simultaneously with two types of grounding labels together.Our self-supervised data augmentation is inspired by GLIPwhich applied pre-trained GLIP model to obtain pseudo-labelsof raw web-crawled image-text pairs to finetune the same GLIPmodel. We first collect samples from an e-commerce site to scalegrounding data and especially to enrich e-commerce related se-mantic concepts which is different from general domain. We stepfurther to obtain pseudo-labels from two pre-trained models sothat as a student model, CPG model benefits from both generalknowledge transferred from MDETR and specialized brand knowl-edge transferring from logo detection model. Because of crossattention between logos and product details, CPG model enablesproduct understanded in both the general context and the brandspecific context. Furthermore, CPG model enables comprehensivebrand understanding by unifying logo understanded and repre-sentative sample products understanding. Therefore, CPG modeloutperforms the logo detection teacher model when applying tothe product-brand matching task, which will be described later insection 4.",
    "RELATEDWORK AND CONTRIBUTON": "MDETR extended trans-former based object detection model, i.e. DETR , to a modulatedmultimodal model trained with two tasks: object detection andphrase grounding. Therefore, MDETR could be pre-training with1.3M text-images pairs having explicit alignment between phrasesin text and objects in the image from combined pre-existed datasets,e.g. MS COCO, Flickr30k and etc.In order to further expand the visual concepts of image regionsbeyond vocabularies of pre-existing datasets, a recent line of work considers using web-scale raw image-text pairs. CLIP demonstrates that image-level representations can be learned ef-fectively through alignment between raw image-text pairs collectedfrom the internet. Following same idea, GLIP pre-trains aphrase grounding model with 24 million web-crawled image-textpairs. regions of interest in images were detected by pre-training teacher model. Following the trend of using free-form text, we train the CPGmodel with 2.3M product entities synthesizing from an e-commercesite in self-supervised fashion. The bounding boxes for product-noun-to-object taskare generating by a pre-trained general domain modulated detec-tion model conditional on noun phrases parsed from free-formproduct title using general NLP parser. : Left: logo localized by the logo detection teachermodel and product localized by the phrase-grounding teachermodels; Right: only product regions localized by the phrase-grounding teacher model. Teacher models can locate rareentities expressed in product titles. The GPG rep-resentations contain comprehensive visual-language understandingof logos, brand strings, product details for the query product entityand for all brand representative product entities. Therefore, thesimilarity between them shed light on identifyed the correct brandof an input product from homonym ones, either through straight-forward logo comparison or through product region comparison inthe absence of logos.We summarize the contributions of our work as follows: We propose an efficient and scalable method to learn seman-tic rich visual representations for e-commerce products in aself-supervising fashion. We leveraged massive raw producttext data and images and appliing teacher models to obtainregion-phrase alignment annotations. In this way, we ex-tended the limited general vocabulary to substantial visualconcepts expressing in e-commerce catalog. We transfer knowledge from 2 teacher models: logo detec-tion model and a general domain phrase grounding model byleveraging high-confidence predictions as pseudo labels forcatalog specific tasks so that CPG benefits from both general-domain knowledge and specialized catalog knowledge.",
