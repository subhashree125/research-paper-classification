    "yi() is the output of the DDPG actor network for the i-th sample, representing the action chosen by thenetwork": "Initially, we generate a dataset based on the Markowitz model, simulating optimal investment portfolios under variousmarket conditions. This dataset encompasses asset allocation, projected returns, and risk assessments. Neural networkarchitectures are then employed to preprocess this dataset, ensuring compatibility with the input requirements of theDDPG actor network and providing exposure to a diverse array of market scenarios. Subsequently, the refined dataset serves as a platform for the supervised learning phase of the DDPG actor network. This pre-trainingphase is pivotal as it not only instills a baseline strategy based on well-established financial theories but also enhancesthe DDPG agent with robust financial acumen, essential for navigating real-market environments and making prudentdecisions. Moreover, this approach significantly accelerates the DDPG agents learning curve by endowing it with pre-learnedpatterns and strategies, greatly reducing the need for extensive data and time expenditure during subsequent reinforce-ment learning stages. This integration not only enriches the agents repository ofdecision-making strategies but also maintains a harmonious balance between exploiting established strategies andexploring new market opportunities.",
