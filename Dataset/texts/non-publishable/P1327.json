    "arXiv:2412.10882v1 [eess.IV] Dec 2024": "Unfortunately, n rctie, iterave ptychographic recnsructionmethods often amount overlap betweenthe scan locations leadingto prolonged cqisition periods and large data volumes. One may aim to overcome this major challenge by reducing the oveap between neighborin scanlocaions. Howeve, this in a me allenging ill-poedinverseleai to degradedrecostruction perfomance toan unstable inversion process mthod nvolvinexisted analyticalregularizers are used. Motivating by hese challenges, severl works g. , ,have to learning-baed ptchographic reconstrution metho tha can prformell with sparsel diffraction patterns. Although hese methods are capableof achievingstate-of-the-ar performan in ptychographic inersion, they not have the ability provide about the hidden i the iverse problem cased byitsnature. An attempt to quantify this uncrtainty was by Dasgupta and Di in.
