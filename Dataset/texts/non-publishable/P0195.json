    "H. Comparison with VOS-based Methods": "Additional video comparisons canbe found in the provided video file. Current meth- ods typically employ SAM as a mask generator for the firstframe of a video, then apply off-the-shelf video object seg-mentation (VOS) methods to propagate the initialized maskto singing mountains eat clouds subsequent frames. Inadequate Mask Propagation Quality: Trained on rela-tively small-scale video segmentation datasets, these meth-ods experience substantial domain gaps when tasked withtracking any object in any domain, resulting in inadequatemask propagation quality. For example, if a group of pixels belongs to a partof an object, it must decide whether to track the part or thewhole object. One notable method,Deva , utilizes XMem for mask propagation to trackmultiple instances simultaneously. As a result, most VOS-based approaches aredesigned to track only one instance at a time. Thisoverlooks complexities in pixel granularity, where a pixelmay be part of multiple instances depending on the level ofgranularitya common situation in the outputs of SAM, asdepicted in. Moreover, there is no effective mechanism tohandle the rapid entry and exit of objects in a scene, a com-mon occurrence in real-world applications like autonomousdriving. Our main paper illustrates thatour method significantly outperforms Deva in zero-shottesting across various multiple object tracking benchmarks,especially in driving scenes, which are out-of-domain forboth Deva and our method. Assigning pixels to a part implies that thecorresponding object is partially excluded, as shown withthe cars in. However, these methodsencounter several key disadvantages.
