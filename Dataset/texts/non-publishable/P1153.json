Participants predicted the next item (Tasks 1 and 2) orthe title of the next item (Task 3) to be purchased based on the pre-vious session item set. We used Item2Vec similarity andUniversal Sentence Encoder similarity in addition to theco-visitation relations between products, to better capture the tran-sition relationships between products. E-commerce is one of the mostpopular cases of SBRS, which identifies a users explored topic andprovides relevant items from numerous number items publishedon site. enhanced GRU4Rec by incorporating hierarchical relationshipsacross sessions. In this paper, we propose an approach for predicting the nextproduct in a single session. SBRS predicts a users preference for next itembasing on a series of user activities, such as clicking, viewing, andpurchasing items on a website. Quadrana etal. proposing STAN , which includes both sequential andtime information. Our focus is on the next product predictionsolution. There-fore, SBRS aims to model users short-term and dynamic prefer-ences, unlike collaborative and content-based filtering, which cap-ture long-term preferences. Rendle etal. For all other uses, contact the owner/author(s). The relationship betweenthese interactions is useful for estimating a users search intentionsand interesting topics. In addition, assuming anonymous user whodoes not log in, some studies have proposed methods that focus ona single session and are not linked to user information. To handle massive numbersof candidate products, we first extracting several hundred candidateproducts and then re-ranked them using LightGBM. Markov chainsmodel the transition relationship between interactions. Recent methods are mostly based on recurrentneural network (RNN) because of its advantages in modeling se-quential relationships.
