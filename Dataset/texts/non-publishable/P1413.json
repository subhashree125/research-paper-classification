We note from ourevaluations (Table-6) that ASR with temperature 0 is always higher than ASR with default (higher)temperatures for a fixed attack budget. Thus our results are more conservative than those presentedon JailbreakBench. To ensure robustness of the resulting prompt, and repeatability, we prompt thetarget model with the same question 4 times, and ensure it produces a toxic response as evaluated byMjudge at least 3 times. We further present results by firstly identifying jailbreaks using our methodof setting the default temperature, and further verifying that these are able to jailbreak even withtemperature of 0, in Table-6 of the Appendix. Firstly, we note that for the setting of temperature=1,ASR drops as we increase the criterion on the number of successes when prompted multiple times.Further, the ASR with temperature of 0 is higher than the setting we consider above. We further present attack success rates on several recent open sourced and closed sourcedLLMs with temperature of the target LLM set to 0 (as in JailbreakBench) in . In this ta-ble we present comprehensive results on ASR at different thresholds, where ASR @ k/n denotesthat k question augmentations out of n are successful jailbreaks. We additionally present statis-tics on the number of jailbreaks generated per seed. Based on the results, we find that thereare two sets of models which are partitioned in the table - the first set (GPT-4o, Gemma2-9B-ITand Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct) comprises of the more recent models that are robust to the seedquestion at both 0 temperature and 0.5 temperature with 100x prompting, highlighting that seedprompts from JailbreakBench are possibly a part of their training data. The second set of models(GPT-3.5-Turbo-1106, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 and Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1)are the ones that have ASR in the 40-70% range on the seed prompts themselves, suggesting that thesemodels have not been trained on the full set of these questions. Across all models, we obtain very highattack success rates (89-99%) which is always higher than the paraphrasing baseline, highlightingthat the proposed approach indeed enhances the diversity of the seed prompt. Further, we note thatthe gains at all ASR thresholds are considerably higher for the proposed approach in the first setof models - which are possibly trained on these seed prompts - indicating that our attack strategyis indeed effective in understanding the generalization of LLMs to prompts used in safety training.Since the second set of models are possibly not trained on many of these seed questions, even smallperturbations to the prompts are effective in jailbreaking the model. Thus ASR at higher thresholds",
