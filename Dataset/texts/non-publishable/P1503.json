Cognitive Approach: Adopt a dual perspective to model a multi-step algebraic problemusing a literal expression represented both as a sum and as a product. This activity rein-forces mastery of this property. Exercise Statement:To decorate her house, Julie enters a store and buys 5 of each of the following items: greenplants and flower pots. Depending on the problem scenario, the students intuitiveapproach might involve modeling with a literal expression in either expanded form (sum ofexpressions) or factored form (product of expressions). For example, 1 6 of a tulip corresponds to 1 rose. Let p be the price of a green plant.
