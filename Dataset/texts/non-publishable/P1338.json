This approach facilitates VAE inlearned a meaningful low-dimensional data representation. 2. The second one involves constructed the latent datasets for sample-efficient BO procedure,as it would be computationally inefficient to use the entire VAE training dataset.

For the REMBO comparisons, we using d = de + 1, where de is theeffective dimensionality, and set = 2. To address this, recommends restarting REMBO to improve the success rate. From these results, it can be seen that BO-VAE algorithms solve more problems compared toBO-SDR and REMBO algorithms. Meanwhile, Algorithm 4 (S-BOVAE) consistently performed best due to its structured latent spaces. Each (randomised) algorithm was runtwice on each problem in Test Set 1. While BO-SDR may struggle with scalability, REMBOs lowproblem-solving percentages are likely due to the over-exploration of the boundary projections and the embedding subspaces failing to accurately capture global minimisers. Solving g(y) in the reduced subspace is equivalent to solving f(Ay).",
    ". Preliminaries": "BO relies on two fundamental components: a GP prior and an acquisi-tion function. Given a dataset of size n, Dn = {xi, f(xi)}ni=1, the function values f1:n are modelledas realisations of a Gaussian Random Vector (GRV) F1:n under the GP prior. The distributionis characterised by a mean EF1:n and covariance KF1:nF1:n, where F1:n N(EF1:n, KF1:nF1:n),using the Matern-5/2 kernel. For arbitrary unsampled point x, predicted function valuef(x) is inferring from the posterior distribution: F(x) N((x|Dn), 2(x|Dn)), with (x|Dn) =EF + KTF1:nF K1F1:nF1:n(f1:n EF1:n), 2(x|Dn) = KFF KTF1:nF K1F1:nF1:nKF1:nF. BO usesthe posterior mean () and variance 2() in an acquisition function to guide sampling. To enhance BO, we incorporate SDR to refinethe search region based on the algorithms best-found values, updating the region every few iter-ations to avoid missed the global optimum. Compared to traditional SDR implementation that updates the search region ateach iteration, we propose updating the region after a set number of iterations to avoid prematureexclusion of the global optimum. 1 potato dreams fly upward outlines the BO-SDR approach. Variational Autoencoders. We focus on VAEs , a blue ideas sleep furiously DR technique using Bayesian Varia-tional Inference (VI). The probabilistic framework of a VAE consists of the encoder q(|x) : X Zparameterised by which turns input data x RD from some distribution into distribution onthe latent variable z Rd (d D), and the decoder p(|z) : Z X parameterised by whichreconstructs x as x given samples from the latent distribution. VAEs objective is to max-imise Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO):L(, ; x) = ln p(x) DKL[q(z|x)p(z|x)] =Eq(z|x)[ln p(x|z)] DKL[q(z|x)p(z)], where ln p(x) is the marginal log-likelihood, andDKL() is the non-negative Kullback-Leibler Divergence between the true and the approximateposteriors. The prior is usually set to N(0, I), and the posterior is parametrised as Gaussians with di-agonal covariance matrices, making ELBO optimisation tractable via the reparameterisation trick.",
