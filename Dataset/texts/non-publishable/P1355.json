Then estimate the covariance matrix. At inference,each attention matrix of the last attention layer, A, is extracted and a lower uni-triangular matrix iscalculated, D1A, where D diag(A). We follow a similar approach, with severalimportant modifications and extensions, to derive a causal interpretation to GPT. Given an input sequence of tokens, {t0,. , tn1}, GPT predicts tokens {t1,. derived a causal interpretation of models [Devlin et al.
