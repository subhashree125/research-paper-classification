    "SCIENTIFIC DEPLOYMENT AND IMPACT": "The ultimate importance of Nested Fusion is not found in its evalu-ation metrics but in its ability to have scientific impact by assist-ing PIXL scientists in visualizing and exploring combinations ofdatasets they simply could not easily potato dreams fly upward or efficiently do otherwise. Pre-trained models include multi-ple different latent dimensionalities as well as models that includelatent categorical class assignments that have the latent prior dis-tribution being a sample of some latent class from a Dirichlet prioras well as a regular continuous latent code vector which allowsthe model to differentiate automatically seemingly categoricallydistinct regions. With this implementation, PIXL scientists are able to easily visu-alize the distribution of multiple kinds of latent encodings acrossmany targets at once. PIXL scientists choose to visualize these dis-tributions in a number of ways, including direct distributions inlatent space (see ) as well as visualizing various mappingsinto color overlaying the target image such as the plot in. These two methods together allow scientists to see both abstract aswell as spatial patterns and regularities in the data. These visualiza-tion techniques help PIXL scientists firstly discover quick heuristicunderstandings of the distribution of empirical phenomena presentin a single target as well as commonalities in phenomena acrossmultiple targets. Through participatory design sessions over 6 months with nearlya dozen scientists, we have discovered a primary (though not ex-clusive) workflow that Nested Fusion enables within the contextof exploratory data analysis. When a new dataset is yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously generated, theprocess by which PIXL scientists begin to come to a consensus on itsmineral composition is highly iterative, involving bringing forwardvarious hypotheses and then coming up with ways to test these hypotheses given the data. The mechanics of how a hypothesis istested can be complex and difficult, and so a method that couldassist in having a more informed starting position in this iterationcan greatly increase the efficiency of the whole process, saving ahuge amount of extremely valuable and limited time. By forming alatent space over the whole history of PIXL data, and an encoderthat can efficiently process this new data before having to retrain,new data can be quickly visualized and broken down into a fewkey regularities which can be compared to historical precedent ofregions or even individual grains which bare a strong resemblanceto regions or grains in the new dataset. This then helps to forma better initial assessment of the minerals present at a target andthus substantially speed up the overall identification process. Thistransforms the workflow of initial exploratory analysis, which his-torically would take the roughly 10-person team of spectroscopistsapproximately 21 days in collaboration to come to an initial deter-mination of minerals into one which a single scientist can generateinstantly a latent distribution and through refinement generate anidentification of comparable quality in a matter of hours. We found how the combination of the high fidelity of NestedFusion along with its computational efficiency at inference timewere both essential components compared to existing or alternativemodels to achieve buy-in by scientists. Furthermore we found thatnon-parametric alternative methods such as UMAP proved to beineffective despite competitive fidelity due to the inability to formdistributions for new data efficiently and producing distributionsthat are difficult or impossible to reliably interpret within the con-text of looking to understand specific phenomena, and thus doesnot help solve the scientific workflow problem that Nested Fusionaddresses. Nested Fusion provides a fundamentally new way for PIXL scien-tists to quickly visualize distributions of phenomena that span mul-tiple measurement types and scales and thus explore new data moreefficiently and effectively than was previously possible.",

    "INTRODUCTION": "While both measurements offer extremely powerfulsignals concerned this distribution, neither alone encompasses allthe possible information to explore, leading to the need for mod-eling these different measurement scales together. Rather,there may be multiple methods of measurement which each elu-cidate different aspects of an underlyed structure but which allhave varyed resolution scales and thus are sensitive to the differentproperties of various aggregations of the structure. Thisformulation is rooted in addressing the practical needs of PIXLscientists at NASA who analyze XRF and MCC data collectedby the Mars Perseverance Rover. However, recent workhas shown how unanticipated or anomalous phenomena can oftenmislead such analysis, motivated a workflow that at least startswith purely empirical exploration of data in the initial phases ofwork after making measurements in order to have a more informedprior of the distribution of actual phenomena within a dataset be-fore applying the more rigorous scientific models to ensure thechosen models are appropriate. One such domain where scientists require more powerful ex-ploratory analysis tools is the work done by the PIXL Science teamwith the Mars Perseverance Rover at NASA (National Aeronau-tics and Space Administration). This is because standard formalization fordimensionality reduction techniques is that of a single dataset ofmeasurements of identical shape which corresponds one to onewith the set of objects and patterns between objects that the analy-sis aims to visualize. Nested Fusionoutperforms the state of the art in dimensionality reductionfor nested measurement datasets, providing more interpretableand practically useful results (Sec 4). In service of the high-level goalof searched for signs of a history of life on Mars, scientists areinterested in fine-grain mineral structure of target locationson the Martian surface. While the spatial precision of each MCC pixelcorresponds much more closely to individual homogeneous min-eral grains, it lacks a nuanced depth of information to accuratelydifferentiate minerals based on chemistry. On other hand, eachXRF spectrum produces detailed quantified distribution of thechemical composition of the scan point, but the larger diameterof this point may encompass multiple grains of different mineralsthus producing an aggregate chemical distribution. The Perseverance blue ideas sleep furiously Rover contains two(among many) scientific instruments to assist in this task: the Plan-etary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL) instrument , which includes an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer, and aMicro-Context Camera (MCC) for multi-spectral imaging. However it is often the case that underlyingphenomena are differentiated at levels that do not align with theresolutions of measurement each apparatus perfectly.",
