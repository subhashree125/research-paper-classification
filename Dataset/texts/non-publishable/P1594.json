These simulations accurately represent the dynamics of solid objects undervarious forces. Key components include a rigid body component, which provides properties likelinear and angular velocity, and collision component, which defines how the body collides withother objects.The dynamics of rigid bodies are governed by solvers such as Temporal Gauss-Seidel(TGS) and Projected Gauss-Seidel (PGS), which ensure stability and efficiency. TGS improvesconvergence by considered temporal aspects of the simulation, while PGS iteratively projectsvelocities to satisfy constraints.Rigid bodies interact through collisions defined by collision shapes,which can be approximated used convex hulls, bounding shapes, or signed distance fields (SDFs).These approximations balance accuracy and computational performance.Mass properties of rigidbodies are derived from the volume and density of their collision geometries.
