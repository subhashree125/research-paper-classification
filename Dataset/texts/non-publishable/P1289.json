    "Abstract": "Whilemachine learning-based approaches have shown promise in enhancing these fore-casts, remain confined to specific markets on which they are limiting their adaptability to new or unseen markets. We propose doubly residual N-BEATS network with KolmogorovArnold networks core time series forecasting. The models effectiveness was tested inpredicting day-ahead electricity prices in a zero shot fashion. models, our proposed results. By leveragingthe Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, our model can potentially enhance tocapture complex patterns in energy price data, thus improving forecast accuracyacross diverse market conditions. This addition not only enriches the models also contributes to more flexible forecastingtool adaptable to various energy",
