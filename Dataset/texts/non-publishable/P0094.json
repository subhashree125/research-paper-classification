    ". Introduction": "This presentsa substantially more challenging task in video understand-ing. With the rapid development of video models, signifi-cant progress has been made in the domain of video un-derstanding. These approachesoverlook the temporal relationships between different seg-ments, thus limiting their understanding of the video con-tent. Works likeMovieChat rely on the question input to constructvideo representations and answers. Recently, the first long video understanding bench-mark, MovieChat has been proposed. Anotherline of work adopts a series of foundational models to con-vert video content into textual representations, which werefer to as storytelling methods. MovieChat enables quantitative evaluation of long-formvideo understanding capabilities in question-answering. They leverage thepowerful language understanding capabilities of LLMs tocomprehend video content based on the generated scripts. Most previous video models focus on end-to-end train-ing to build a video question-answering system. However, these methods either perform captioning on eachindividual frame or use scene detection to segment visu-ally continuous shots as the basic unit. It includes 1,000 high-quality video clips sourced from various movies andTV series, accompanied by 14,000 manual annotations.",
