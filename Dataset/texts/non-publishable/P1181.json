RSSI signals are not stable, they fluctuaterandomly due to shadowing, fading and multi-path effects. Some of the works utilise deep neural networks (DNN) togenerate coarse positioning estimates from RSSI signals, which arethen refined by a hidden Markov model (HMM) to produce a finalestimate location. Other works, , try to utilise a time-series ofRSSI data and exploit the temporal connections within each accesspoint to estimate room-level position. A CNN is used to build lo-calisation models to further leverage the temporal dependenciesacross time-series readings. It has been suggested that we cannot rely on RSSI alone forindoor localisation in home environments for PD subjects due toshadowed rooms with tight separation. Classic machine learning approaches such as Random Forest (RF),Artificial Neural Network (ANN), k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) aretested, and the result shows that RF outperforms other methodsin tracked person in indoor environments. Poulose et al. combinesmartphone IMU sensor data and Wi-Fi receiving signal strengthindication (RSSI) measurements to estimate the exact location (inEuclidean position X, Y) of a person in indoor environments. The proposed sensor fusion framework uses location fingerprintingin combination with a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithmto reduce the positioning errors. Looking at this multi-modality classification / regression problemfrom a timeseries perspective, there has been a lot of explorationsin tackling a problem where each modality can be categorised asmultivariate timeseries data. LSTM and attention layersare often used in parallel to directly transform raw multivariatetime series data into low-dimensional feature representation foreach modality. Later, various processed is done to further extractcorrelations across modalities through the use of various layers(e. concatenation, CNN layer, transformer, self-attention). where we onlyutilise accelerometer data to enrich the RSSI, instead of utilising allIMU sensors, in order to reduce battery consumption.",
