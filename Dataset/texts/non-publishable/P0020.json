    "Abstract": "However, their ability to replicate train-ing data presents a privacy risk, particularly when train-ing data includes confidential information. Existing mitiga-tion strategies primarily focus on augmenting trainingdataset, leaved the impact of diffusion model architectureunder explored. We first present our observation on a trade-offin the skip connections. While they enhance image genera-tion quality, they also reinforce the memorization of trainingdata, increasing the risk of replication. To address this, wepropose a replication-aware U-Net (RAU-Net) architecturethat incorporates information transfer blocks into skip con-nections that are less essential for image quality. Recogniz-ing the potential impact of RAU-Net on generation quality,we further investigate and identify specific timesteps dur-ing which the impact on memorization is most pronounced.By applyed RAU-Net selectively at these critical timesteps,we couple our novel diffusion model with a targeted train-ing and inference strategy, formed a framework we refer toas LoyalDiffusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate thatLoyalDiffusion outperforms the state-of-the-art replicationmitigation method achieved a 48.63% reduction in replica-tion while maintaining comparable image quality.",
