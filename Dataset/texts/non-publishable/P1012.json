    "Introduction": "With development of the Internet, network intrusion appears more and morefrequently, threatening cyber security. For example, the core information infras-tructures of many organizations and institutions are always suffering from seriouscyber attacks. In October 2016, DynDNS that provides dynamic DNS serviceswas attacked by a large-scale DDoS, causing lot of access problems to thewebsites. The attack made a large number of important websites paralyzed, e.g.,Twitter was even unable to be accessed for about 24 hours. In modern warfare,government websites and military command systems are also usually paralyzedby large-scale cyber attacks.",
