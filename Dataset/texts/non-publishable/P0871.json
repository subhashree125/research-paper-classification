GMMs are particularly useful for modeling data thatexhibit multiple underlying distributions, assuming thatall data points are generated from a mixture of severalGaussian distributions with unknown parameters. Each Gaussian component within a GMM represents acluster characterized by its mean, variance, and mixingcoefficient. In the context of synthetic tabular data generation,GMMs approximate the data distribution, making themhighly applicable for generating new samples that pre-serve the statistical properties of the original dataset. This is especially useful in cybersecurity, where mod-eling the intricate patterns of network traffic or attackvectors requires flexible and accurate representation ofcomplex, multimodal distributions. GMMs providea robust method for capturing these patterns, allowingfor generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world scenarios. c) Sampling: After training the model, synthetic datais generated by randomly selecting a Gaussiancomponent (based on its weight) and then sam-pling a point from the selected Gaussian using itsparametric values.
