Specifically, we at-tempt to model the score function as S = c log pt(cmn |GNN(F nP , fm)), where fm represents the encoded featurefor mth part in the part set, and cmn denotes the corre-sponding selection boolean value for this single part. TheGNN is implemented using an EdgeConv-based structure. G-FARS-CG, G-FARS-R, and G-FARS-T apply an MLP,ResNet , and Transformer , respectively, to learnthe new score function. In these variants, we separate theGNN from the score function, aimed to determine whetherthe G-FARS framework can be effectively adapted to scorefunctions modeling in this manner. Furthermore, we seek toexplore whether applying better architectures can enhancethe networks performance under this new modeling ap-proach.",
