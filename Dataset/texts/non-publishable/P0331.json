Finally, this team training theentire model end-to-end using the L1 loss function. YunfanThis team has devised a comprehensive methodfor demosaicing images from event cameras by leveraginga sophisticated framework that combines the Swin Trans-former and U-Net architectures, as shown in Fig-ure 9. They have methodically outlined a multi-faceted ap-proach consisting of preprocessing, encoding, decoding, re-construction, and a novel loss function, each contributinguniquely to the image reconstruction process.In the preprocessed phase, the team effectively trans-forms the input RAW image and reduces computationalcomplexity using space-to-depth operations and 1 1convolutions. encoding stage, utilized Swin Trans-former blocks, extracts multi-scale features and captureslong-range dependencies, while the decoding phase mir-rors the encoding structure, progressively recovering theimages spatial resolution. teams reconstruction mod-ule is adept at generating the final RGB image from upsam-pled features by reversed the preprocessing operations andrefining the high-dimensional features into a standard colorspace.Notably, the teams strategic innovation lies in their two-stage training methodology that employs a Charbonnier lossfor initial training and a Pixel Focus Loss for fine-tuning.They have meticulously engineered the Pixel Focus Lossto address long-tail distribution issues in training loss, fo-",
