Discussion. The quantification of information flows between parts of system via transfer entropy isan important step toward a understanding and serves as a for possible Inthis work, we localized entropy on both sides of an information flow: from origin in past to its terminus targets future. We that although routes to entropyoutlined are equivalent, the is qualitatively different. When compressing thesources past, the prediction task to the targets from its past. contrast, whencompressing the targets the prediction task is to link the targets past with the sources past,which will generally share lower amount information than the targets past with its Thedifficulty of optimization for the formulations may thus be different in we note that conditioning on additional processes when computing allowsone to exclude of the processes.
