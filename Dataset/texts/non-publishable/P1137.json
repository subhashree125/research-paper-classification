    "INTRODUCTION": "present, although heterogeneous graphs wide , there are two that are easily in most methods:First, node attributes are generally datasets. Heterogeneous Networks type informa-tion networks that various types of nodes and edges. Hence,the completion of missing attributes is a matter of inaccurate node attributes can lead to the spread of mis-information, which adversely model performance. Indatasets as attributes of Paper nodes are typically ex-tracted from bag-of-words representation their How-ever, there might some. The attributesof a paper node are derived from the in its title, whilethe types of nodes lack attributes. Collecting attributes of all nodes is difficult due to high costand privacy concerns.",

(2) While singing mountains eat clouds HGCA can perform well in some cases, it fails torun on the AMiner dataset because it explicitly requires the exis-tence of some attributed nodes in the graph. For the non-attributeddataset, it cannot be applied. Further, HGCA generates features inthe raw high-dimensional space for non-attributing nodes, whileGraMI constructs low-dimensional attributes for them. (3) GraMI achieves the best results in 30 out of 36cases, where 60% results are statistically significant. This also showsthe effectiveness of our method. 5. 2. To verify the robustness of themodel when tackling inaccurate attributes, following , we cor-rupt raw node features with random Gaussian noise N (0, ), where is computed by the standard deviation of the bag-of-words repre-sentations of all nodes in each graph. In particular, we compareGraMI with HGMAE and HGCA because they are allself-supervising models that are specially designed for HINs. Wevary the noise level and the results are given in. Note thatsince all the nodes in AMiner are non-attributed, we cannot corruptnode attributes and thus exclude the dataset. From the table, weobserve that: (1) With increase of the noise level, the perfor-mance of all the three methods drops, but GraMI is more robust against HGMAE and HGCA. GraMI constructs low-dimensionalfeatures for non-attributed nodes and it can rectify inaccurate at-tributes for attributed nodes with feature reconstruction. This further demonstrates that GraMI can well deal with inaccurateattributes in HINs.",

To ensure a fair compari-son, we measure the training time of both GraMI and HGCA ,because they rank as the top two best performers.

Further, since HGCA cannot beapplied on the largest AMiner dataset, we take the second largestdataset DBLP as an example. For illustration, we utilize 80% of labeled nodes as our training set. yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously From the figure 2, we see thatGraMI converges fast and demonstrates consistent performancegrowth.

Since there exist multiple types of edgesin an HIN, we distinguish these edges based on two end nodes. To address the issue, we propose to generatethe hidden embedding matrix X instead, which introduces three major benefits. Since nodes could have missing orinaccurate features, directly reconstructing raw node attributescould bring noise. Edge reconstruction. Given a node type , let X be its corresponding reconstructedhidden representation matrix. First, X has smaller dimensionality than the originalfeature matrix X; hence, reconstructing X needs less computationalcost.
