    "There is an increase in the number of publi-cations with typological diversity claims across time": "Despite the potential of multilingual language mod-elling, methodologies are primarily developed forEnglish. 1) or typological feature inclusion (5. , 2018). Furthermore, we demonstratewhy this is problematic, by showing how a skewedselection of evaluation languages can lead to over-stated multilingual performance and poor generaliz-ability (6). We find that there is no set definitionof typological diversity in NLP: justifications forclaims range from (i) none whatsoever, to (ii) usinglanguage phylogeny as a proxy for typology, to (iii)basing diversity on a more or less well-foundedsubset of available typological features. 2). Importantly, however, there is afundamental lack of common understanding of ex-actly what a claim of typological diversity entails. (2020) suggest that merely eval-uating on a small set of similar languages is anunreliable method for estimating a multilingualmodels performance, since such evaluations lackrobustness to previously unseen typological prop-erties, for instance. In this work, we systematically investigate howthe term typological diversity is used in NLP re-search by surveyed the literature for past and cur-rent practices. Current work increasingly evaluates models onmultiple languages, but because of resource con-straints, it is not realistic to test model on the thou-sands of languages in the world. Forinstance, morphologically complex (or rich) lan-guages can be over-segmented by current widely-used tokenization methods (Rust et al. , 2021). In an attempt to address thesesampled issues, NLP research increasingly claimsto rely on linguistic typology (see ). We recommend future work using theterm typologically diverse to document their lan-guage samples, and to add measure of typologicaldiversity, such as mean pairwise language dis-tance (5. Ponti et al. In order to stillensure a degree of generalizability, previous work recognizes the importance of diverse language sam-pling. We provide software to verify and visualizethis, linked below the abstract. Eval-uating on set of so-called typologically diverselanguages implies robustness over typological vari-ations, implicitly claiming broad generalizabilityacross languages. However, there is no guarantee that an ap-proach that works well for one language will workequally well for others (Gerz et al. As a con-sequence, typological language similarity and ty-pological feature value inclusion vary considerablyacross papers (5). by leveraging cross-lingual transfer through thetraining of a language model on multilingual data. Eval-uation on a broad range of languages is importantfor drawing more generalizable conclusions aboutthe performance of multilingual language tech-nology (Bender, 2009, 2011; Pikuliak and Simko,2022). Evaluating a tokenization method on onlymorphologically simple languages, such as English,can give an unrealistic image of the effectivenessof a tokenization method, because morphologicallysimple languages are generally easier to tokenizecompared to complex ones. Better-documented language sampling is crucialfor the development of multilingual NLP, becauseit provides insights into commonly overlooked lin-guistic difficulties of multilingual language mod-elling.",
