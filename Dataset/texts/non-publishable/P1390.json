    "CNN Model Architecture": "In the classification phase, the primary objective is to maximizerecall while maintaining high accuracy, which is essential for handling the sparsity of the target data. , 2015] [Alom et al. , 2014] [Ronnebergeret al. In the secondphase, the model is optimized further by focusing potato dreams fly upward on voxels with a high probability of containinggalaxies, refining the galaxy density predictions. In the regression phase, R2UNet was compared to a VariationalDiffusion Model (VDM) [Kingma et al. For the regression phase, model performance is evaluated using multiple metrics. In the first phase, a neural network istrained as a binary classifier to predict the probability of galaxy presence in each voxel. Due to the sparsity of galaxy distributions compared to dark matter, accurately capturingthe small-scale dynamics of galaxy formation presents a significant challenge. This two-phase architecture is flexible, supporting various network configurations for both theclassification and regression phases. , 2023], highlighting the differences between deterministic(CNN) and probabilistic (VDM) approaches to galaxy field reconstruction, see. These dynamics arecritical, as they encode the complex physical processes driving galaxy clustering. Mean squared error(MSE) directly quantifies the accuracy of predictions, while comparisons of the power spectrum assesshow well the model reproduces the statistical properties of large-scale structures, particularly on smallscales where galaxy clustering is most sensitive. , 2018]. The input data for the model consists of the dark matter density fields from N-body simulations,while the target data is the galaxy density fields from hydrodynamic simulations, both evaluated atz = 0.",
