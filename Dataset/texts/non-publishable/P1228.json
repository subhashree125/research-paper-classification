    "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK": "This paper introduces systematic approach to knowledge infusionin transformer-based models. Even more so theinfusion techniques on both latent representations andinductive of the model across all transformer. The findings incorpo-rated external knowledge the models on understanding tasks.",
    "ABSTRACT": "language models have achieved impressive suc-cess in various language tasks due to their abilityto capture complex dependencies contextual usingself-attention mechanisms. However, they are without limita-tions. Theselimitations stem from absence of implicit and contextin the alone.

    "(c) Shallow Knowledge Infusion": "In such cases, knowledgeinfusion operation is performed on all the latent representationscorresponding to the multiple heads. It is important to note that singleblock usually consists of multiple heads, each associated with itsown set of latent representations. Shallow Infusion involves the operation of infusing the knowledgeat the latent representations of just the first transformer block of atransformer-based architecture.",

    "KNOWLEDGE-INFUSED SELF-ATTENTIONTRANSFORMERS(a) Knowledge Graph Compression forKnowledge Infusion": "Since a transformer architecture consists of two distinct types ofcomponents, namely (i) inductive biases represented as matricesand (ii) latent representations represented as vectors (as depictedin ), the challenge lies in compressing external knowledgefrom knowledge graphs into one of these mathematical represen-tations. This compression process enables the infusion of externalknowledge into the transformer-based models. g. (a)illustrates this knowledge compression process.",
