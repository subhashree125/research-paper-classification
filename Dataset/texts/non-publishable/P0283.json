    ". Consistency Module": "To address these challenges, we propose DCM, whicheliminates the dependence on RGB domain image informa-tion, thereby enhancing depth consistency across differentviews of the same 3D scene. Due to the independence of predic-tions from depth estimation networks, the depth consistencyalgorithm faces two challenges: the global distribution ofdepth ranges for different depths is inconsistent, makingit impractical to simply employ a global scaling factor Sfor standardization. 2, achieving a con-sistent 3D point cloud scene necessitates relying on consis-tent depth information. This can be represented as follows:. Additionally, methods that involve the re-optimization of depth information basedon camera poses require RGB domain image information,making their application challenging in the artistic domain. Specifically, DCM takes thedepth Di from the previous view and the initial depth Di+1from the current view as input, producing the updated depthDi+1 as output. According to the analysis in.",
