Indeed, the user cannot only specify the shape of objects but also per-objectclass information. Semantic masks are however tedious todraw, which impacts usability. Recently, diffusionmodels have made great advances in this domain. Previous attempts to conditiongenerative models were focused on GANs. However, it lacks control over the output. Class-conditional was the first way to introduce conditioningin generative models. Segmentation maps conditioning propose most control to the user. Text-conditioned models offer a compromise.",
