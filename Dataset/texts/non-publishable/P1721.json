In this case, the attackers performance is barely affected, as it can still getinformative responses by issuing OOD queries. As increases, more queries including some IND onesare predicted by the fake model Vf. This makes it more difficult for an attacker to infer which decisionboundaries are IND. We discussed the underlying complexity in detail in Sections 4. 2. As can beseen, the attack accuracy dramatically decreased, which verifies that the OOD behaviour leaks almost noinformation about the IND behaviour. To further demonstrate this, we present in a comparisonbetween the labels predicted by Vo and those predicted by Vf for actual OOD queries (i. true positives)as well as tail-of-distribution IND samples that were detected as OOD (i.
