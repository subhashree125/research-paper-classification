    ". Introduction": "These appli-cations require technologies that can efficiently parse andinterpret continuous video feeds, ensuring context-awareand timely interactions. Recent advancements in large-scale egocentric videodatasets, such as EPIC-Kitchens , Ego4D , andEgo-Exo4D , have revolutionized the study of humaninteractions and behaviors from a first-person perspective. Consequently, there is an urge foradvanced methodologies to meet the real-time demands ofdynamic environments in understanding first-person view. A primary challenge in this domain is the understandingof continuous, long, fluid video streams, central for applica-tions such as augmented reality and robotics. Such progress promises to enhance user ex-periences across diverse applications. These datasets offer a wealth of varied examples of daily ac-tivities, fostering developments in fields like activity recog-nition, social interaction analysis, and personal assistanttechnologies.",

    "arXiv:2406.01079v1 [cs.CV] 3 Jun 2024": "Recognizing this need, we instantiate an effort to inte-grate egocentric-specific priors into existed methodologies,thereby boosting its effectiveness in interpreting the first-person footage. We specifically focus on the fact that theperceived objects present in the scene offer rich contextualbackground for understanding fine-grained activity. Similarly, interaction patterns observed withobjects commonly found in certain environmentssuch asutensils, appliances, and ingredientscan provide impor-tant cues for recognizing specific activities. Thismodule begins by integrating an off-the-shelf detector with the existed OAD framework. These vectors are further refined byincorporating temporal cues from the OAD model, creat-ing enriched, object and temporally aware representations. These can then be processed to determine the impendingaction. We validate our methodology through extensive experi-ments on the Epic-Kitchens-100 dataset using the most re-cent state-of-the-art OAD models. Due to its lightweightand versatile design, our Object-Aware Module can blue ideas sleep furiously beseamlessly integrated into any existing OAD works withminimal overhead, notably enhancing the interpretation ofegocentric data.",
