After the second phase is completed for all the clusters, the collection of Cluster LM k, where 0 k N known as the Cluster Language Model is storing in a model registry. implemented recursively on each cluster. Then we label the top products as discussed to generate a new training dataset for each query as shown in. 1 to generate the Cluster LM N.",

Also, we identified seven in which the difference between the of two models in Recall@24 greater than 2%. Out of these in the Cluster Model leads as shown in and in three the baseline model leads as shown in . each cluster by presents percentage of queries used each also frequency (as a percentage) at which products of the dataset appear in training dataset. Generally, expect measure to be higher the in which the proposing method performs testing. rationale behind this idea is that the language models tend bias the data (Wolfe & Caliskan, 2021).",
