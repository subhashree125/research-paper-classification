We adopt proposed sythetc dataset for bnhmarking drift de-ection techniqes as the drifting subgroup sizes vary. In particular, we are in-tersted in the perfrmance when te drifing subgroups are small, as these arethe drifts that are intuitively more likely o go undetected. We sample subgroupsizes from 1% to 100% (i.e., the full poplation) logarithmically.For each subgrou size, we conduct 100 experiments. For half ofthem, einject drift to a randm subgrop of the desired sze positive experiments).

We either include or discarda candidate slice based on whether it gets the current probability closer to thetarget one. provides an example where a subgroup of approximately thetarget size (10%) is iteratively defined by identifying a first slice on age, followedby a second one on salary.
