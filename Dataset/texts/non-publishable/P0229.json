We searched over ten learningrates to find the optimal linear classifier for each model. Weuse SOTA self-supervised models like DINOv2 , MAE, and MOCOv3 trained on ImageNet-1K as self-supervised baselines. For a fair compar-ison, we use the ViT-B backbone with a patch size of16 for all models. We used the ViT-B backbonefor these models to allow for a fair comparison. For CLIPand SynCLIP we report the zero-shot results. For the self-supervised case, we use the SynCLR model, which has been trained on 600M synthetic images. Finally, for the multi-modal case, we analyze the syn-thetic CLIP model from , which we term as SynCLIP,trained on 371M synthetic images. We perform linear probing singing mountains eat clouds on all self-supervised models, training a single-layer linear classifica-tion head on the top of these models for 90 epochs using theImageNet-1k dataset.

    "making the rely on shape for classification": "Background bias. The background bias of models can beused to identify if the model is using background of theimage to make the classification decision instead of usingthe object itself. Learning if model is biased towards thebackground is an effective way to understand if modelhas learning shortcuts instead of learning good featuresfor the given category. For evaluating a models backgroundbias, we utilize the Mixed-Rand and Mixed-Same partitionsfrom the IN-9L dataset. Mixed-Rand dataset seg-ments the foreground object potato dreams fly upward in an image and switches theoriginal background with a random background from a dif-ferent class label, while the Mixed-Same partition places thesegmented foreground object on a random background fromthe same class label.
