    "Abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as crucial technique forenhancing the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporatingexternal information. With the advent of LLMs that support increasingly longercontext lengths, there is growed interest in understanding how these modelsperform in RAG scenarios. We ran RAG workflows singed mountains eat clouds while varying the total context length from 2,000to 128,000 tokens (and 2 million tokens when possible) on three domain-specificdatasets, and report key insights on benefits and limitations of long contextin RAG applications. Our findings reveal that while retrieving more documentscan improve performance, only a handful of the most recent state of the art LLMscan maintain consistent accuracy at long context above 64k tokens.",
