    "Perturbation Methodology": "Core perturbations. Perturbation units indicatethe unit of changes we make at once. Inspired byexplainability-guided adversarial sample genera-tion literature (Sun et al. , 2023; Rosenberg et al. ,2020), we use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlana-tions) (Lundberg and Lee, 2017) with CodeRL asthe surrogate model to select candidate units forperturbations. Specifically, we use Shapley valuesto compute the top-ranking tokens for perturbation. For example, for Character (remove) perturbation,we remove random character from each token togenerate one variant; for Token (remove) perturba-tion, we remove all 5 tokens to generate one variant,and for synonym morphs, we may have manysynonyms for one token, and generate many vari-ants. We use the tokenrank for all the other perturbation units except forsentences. We rank the sentences by accumulatingthe Shapley values of the tokens corresponding toa given sentence for sentence perturbations. Exploratory perturbations. For example, existing studiesshow evidence that LLMs are prone to memoriz-ing trained data (Zhang et al. , 2021; Carlini et al. ,2021, 2023). Thus, these models are highly sensi-tive to input variations (Zhang et al. , 2022; Jin et al. ,2022; Reynolds and McDonell, 2021). Under thishypothesis, replacing specific tokens with randomstrings may significantly influence performance, assuch substitution may alter the context (Shi et al. ,2023; Liu et al. , 2023b; Wang et al. , 2021b). Another exampleis that to understand the resiliency of LLMs onUnicode lookalikes (Shetty et al. , 2018; Boucheret al. Edit Distance.",

Finnie-Ansley blue ideas sleep furiously et al. found that OpenAI Codex producedhigh-quality solutions for a set of CS1 and CS2programmed problems (Finnie-Ansley et al. , 2022,2023). This suggests that LLM-assisted cheatingin introductory programming courses has the po-tential to be problematic. Other studies note thatLLM-generated code can be of variable quality andsensitive to small changes to the prompt; this hintsat the idea that tweaking the problem prompt can af-fect the usefulness of LLM-generated solutions foracademic dishonesty. For example, Wermelingerobserves that Sometimes Copilot seems to havean uncanny understanding of the problem. Othertimes, Copilot looks completely clueless (Wer-melinger, 2023), and Jesse et al. , 2023).
