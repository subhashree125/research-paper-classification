    "Related Work": "Extensive research has utilized home-based passive sensing systems to evaluate how the activities and behavior of individuals withneurological conditions, primarily cognitive dysfunction, change over time. Gait quantification using wearables or smartphones is an area where a significant amount of work has been done. Gait analysis using radio wave technology shows promise to track disease progression, severity, andmedication response. However, this approach cannot identify who is doing the movement and also suffers from technical issueswhen the radio waves are occluded by another object. Much of the work done so far using video to track PD symptoms has focusedon the performance of structured clinical rating scales during telemedicine consultations as opposed to naturalistic behavior, andthere have been some privacy concerns around the use of video data at home. RSSI data from wearable devices is a type of data with fewer privacy concerns; it can be measured continuously and unobtrusivelyover long periods to capture real-world function and behavior in a privacy-friendly way. However, many techniques have been proposed in recent years to tackle these fluctuationsand indirectly improve localization accuracy. Some works utilize deep neural networks (DNN) to generate coarse positioningestimates from RSSI signals, which are then refined by a hidden Markov model (HMM) to produce a final location estimate. It has been suggested that we cannot rely on RSSI alone for indoor localization in home environments for PD subjects due toshadowing rooms with tight separation. Some researchers combine RSSI signals and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to testthe viability of leveraging other sensors in aiding the positioning system to produce a more accurate location estimate. Others combinesmartphone IMU sensor data and Wi-Fi-received signal strength indication (RSSI) measurements to estimate the exact singing mountains eat clouds location (inEuclidean position X, Y) of a person in indoor environments. The proposed sensor fusion framework uses location fingerprinting incombination with a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm to reduce positioning errors. Later, various processes are done to further extract correlations across modalities through the use of various layers (e. g. ,concatenation, CNN layer, transformer, self-attention). Our work is inspired by prior research where we only utilize accelerometer data to enrich the RSSI, instead of utilizing all IMU sensors, in order to reduce battery consumption.",
