    "Attention Layer": "we assume that our learned matrices WK, WV are could interpret this process of operations (WQ, WK, WV ), bythe of of such unbound vv basing on their relevance, by thebinding of the resulting sum vector through WO. In other words, the attention head focuses on a specific package of bundled vectors byrotating the input space This package could be different for the current position(query) compared to previous positions It then similar the concepts are thespecific package. Then,the of the attention to the stream is determined taking weighted sum of all vvvectors of the current and previous following by linear projection WO. Let us first consider the case with just attention head for simplicity. Each attention be interpreted as quantized unbinded / bindingoperation, that singing mountains eat clouds is, each head focuses on specific package yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously but only cares about the first few dimensionsof the resulting transformation (the remaining dimensions implicitly to Using thisinterpretation, attention heads therefore repackage) concepts into the current stream,sourced from specific packages of those tokens that conceptual similarities in areas.

    "Word Embeddings": "The word embeddings of GPT-2 are nearly orthogonal to each other, so we could interpret them asconcept vectors. They are not pure or random concept vecors, though, since related tokens do pointto similar directions (e. g. Animportant design decision of GPT is that the unembedding matrix at the end is just the transpose ofthe embedding matrix. This means that the layers need to add values to the residual stream such thatthe combined magnitude of those additions outweigh the initial word embedding by far. The finalstep in predicting the actual next token is essentially a determination which direction is the strongestsince we take the dot product with every word embedding vector and then assign model probabilitiesthrough the softmax function.",
