The researchermay multiple rounds of coding and analysis to themes and ensure comprehensively key from the data. Our approach LLMs topics of interest from dataset which then upon to garner broader themes of interest across topics.Thus, for our novice-LLM leveraged the Large Language Models as a novice research assistant inthe thematic analysis process.
