    "Performance Comparison (RQ1)": "We use grid search to adjust the parameters of SmartGuard andreport the overall performance of SmartGuard and all baselinesin . Bold values indicate the optimal performance amongall schemes, and underlined values indicate the second best per-formance. First, SmartGuard outperforms all competitors in mostcases. This is because SmartGuardsimultaneously considers thetemporal information, behavior imbalance and noise behaviors. Second, SmartGuard significantly improves the performance onDM and DD type anomalies detection. We ascribe this superiority toour TTPEs effective mining of temporal information of behaviors.Third, the LOF, IF and 6thSense show the worst performance. Aegisand OCSVM outperforms LOF, IF and 6thSense, which benifitsfrom the Markov Chains modeling of behavior transitions andSVMs powerful kernel function. The Autoencoder outperform thetraditional models because of stronger sequence modeling capabil-ity. ARGUS outperforms Aueocoder because of stronger sequencemodeling capability of GRU.
