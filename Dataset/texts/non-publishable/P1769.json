This is an expected outcome given that BYOL is known to be a superiorrepresentation learner (Grill et al., 2020). Specifically,BYOL+NRCC+GridShift maintains its best position in terms of both NMI and ARI over all six datasets,leaded ahead from its nearest contender, respectively, by 5.80% and 5.43% on average. other NRCCvariant, InfoNCE+NRCC+GridShift, also performs consistently, standing second over five datasets in termsof NMI and four datasets when ARI is considered. These findings unanimously testify that NRCC indeedprovides cluster-friendly embedding space that, when preserved by data dimensionality reduction throughlocal neighborhood preserved UMAP, can significantly improve performance by GridShift without requiringthe knowledge of the number of clusters.
