In otherwords, while HighRes-net recursive fusion produces themost visually pleased image, HighRes-net L-TAE producesan image that is more faithful to the actual changes in thelandscape. As shownin , MISR models can effectively generate images withreduced cloud cover compared to the input Sentinel-2 image,even in cases where the latter is heavily obscured by clouds. However, when comparing outputs of the MISRmodels to the corresponding Sentinel-2 time series, the out-put of HighRes-net L-TAE is more coherent with the timeseries. This shows that L-TAE is effectively assigningmore weight to images close to the date on which we chooseto apply the SR.

However, approaches consider regularly images while SITS are irregular and unaligned(not the same acquisition dates for different SITS) due to of satellite and meteorological conditions. To exploit irregular unaligned time series, we introducea time-equivariant fusion module to model rela-tionships between LR Specifically, we improve onthe light-weight temporal attention encoder (L-TAE), origi-nally designed for SITS classification and later on forSITS panoptic , to integrate the of SITS into MISR. This problem, coined assingle-image super-resolution (SISR), has been withan ever-growing corpus on deep learning, from , and models , yet applications to remote sensing. this context, thevanilla super-resolution ill-posed problem consists ofreconstructing a high-spatial resolution (HR) image from alow-spatial resolution (LR) image.

This explains why the average scoresof SISR models are similar to MISR models. Still, whenevaluating the subset of images where the time differenceis >30 days, MISR models with L-TAE demonstrate lowerMAE values than SISR models. It indicates that L-TAE isindeed capturing temporal information in the time series,contrary to HighRes-net, which performs worst.Length of the series As SITS in real settings can havevarious lengths, we evaluate our model using different num-bers of images.
