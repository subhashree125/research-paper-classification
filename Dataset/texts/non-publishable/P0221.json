    "Abstract": "enhancement in real-world scenarios to complex environments and limita-tions of imaging devices. Conventional methods are oftenconstrained by their tailored models, resulting in dimin-ishing robustness yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously when confronted with challenging degra-dation conditions.In response, we propose asimple highly enhancementframework that estimates straight-line paths from an ele-mentary distribution to high-quality images. Unlike previ-ous diffusion-based methods that from long-time in-ference, constructs a many-to-one transportmapping conditioned rectified flow.The rectificationstraightens trajectories probability transfer, acceler-ating inference by order of magnitude. This design en-ables our FlowIE to fully exploit rich knowledge pre-trained model, rendering it for variousreal-world applications.
