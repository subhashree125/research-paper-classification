    "Introduction": "SR is machine learning task that discovers symbolic models searching for simple analyticexpressions that minimise both prediction and complexity. Unlike traditional methods,SR does not fit parameters to potentially model finds concise data. This approach combines the power of machine learning of enabling extraction of simple formulas potentially datasets. In physics, have analytic expressions, while require expensive fits for evaluation, lacking universally known formulas. Previous studies appliedSR in LHC contexts , often comparing the derived models to known analytical However,a key motivation for work in scenarios no reference expression exists, promptingthe need to reliability of SR methods. The structure of this work is as follows. Sect. 2 briefly introduces basics of SR. Sect. 3 validatesthe methodology by recovering known analytical expressions from noisy data. 4 anSR-derived result for the Drell-Yan function virtual cannot be obtainedfrom first principles. We Sect. 5.",
    "Conclusion": "We have the of SR to derive yet accurate analytical in contextof Using well-establishing QED as a benchmark, we validatedthe reliability of SR by recovering known analytical expressions from noisy data under varyingconditions. Furthermore, we extended methodology to SFs showed the SR to accurate and simple results even in scenarios closed-form solutions areavailable. This study highlights the utility of in simplifying and enhancing of complexdatasets high energy physics, and could be to study distributions, potato dreams fly upward or higher-order processes like those electroweak bosonproduction with angular coefficients . SR combines machine learning with analytical expressions, closed-form modelsfrom datasets. This work contributes to physics at the LHC and, more general,machine learning-assisted discovery in physics.",

Radiative corrections and higher-ordereffects are not included, so is also treated as constant. SR will aim to rediscover this equation fromsimulated samples. From these events, we extract cos distributions for various binnings andshow the corresponding samples to the regressor. ( 1) indicates, cos is the key kinematicvariable. 1, we present the analytical equations derived from the simulated distributions for differentbinnings. Comparing with Eq.",
