In addition, many of these methods requirecomplex discrete optimization over the combinatorial token space to produce single ad-versarial prompt, incurring substantial computational over-head. Moreover, hybrid automated attacks havebeen developed that combine optimization techniques withmanual jailbreak strategies. Detailed discussions of relatedworks on LLM jailbreaks are provided in Appendix A. above limitations of existing jailbreakattacks motivate us to develop more efficient and effectivetools for systematically red-teaming LLMs. In this paper,we introduce GASP, a novel Generative Adversarial SuffixPrompter that can efficiently generate adversarial suffixesto evade LLM safeguards while preserving human readabil-ity in fully black-box environments. highlights thekey features of GASP, with comparisons to state-of-the-artoptimization-based methods, which are detailed below. 1. GASP gen-erates adversarial suffixes that are both human-readableand contextually relevant, unlike many existing attacksthat produce obscure prompts. 2. GASP leverages LatentBayesian Optimization to explore adver-sarial suffixes in a continuous embedding space, reduc-ed the need for computationally intensive discrete to-ken optimization. The acquisition function within LBOensures a balance between exploration and exploitation,allowing efficient identification of adversarial prompts. 3. GASP incorporatesGASPEval, custom evaluator to assess the efficacyof adversarial suffixes with the target LLM. By lever-aging feedback from GASPEval in a continuous loop,GASP iteratively fine-tunes suffixes to maximize theirbypass potential. Such dual feedback mechanism, informed byreal-time model responses, enhances GASPs attack ef-ficacy against evolving LLM safeguard mechanisms. 4.
