We report the best accuracy of99.75% when using Random Forest model. Our proposed fea-ture set, which consists of just 12 features, is of the mostconciseness the field PDF detection. Despite itsmodest size, we obtain results to state-of-the-artthat a much larger set features. 1IntroductionThe flexibility and portability of PDF files makes them apopular malware attacks. Over time, different ap-proaches been proposed to detect PDF malware. Ma-chine learning and neural network based models have par-ticularly shown in these detection tasks. However,the performance of the model relies quality of the fea-ture set Dynamicfeatures are obtained from program execution,such APIs called, instructions executed, or IP addresses ac-cessed. static features obtained through staticanalysis. Dynamic to be in a sandbox environment, sophisticated malware can the sandbox environ-ment and their behaviors. This highlightsthe importance of usage of PDF-specific features, whichmay the attack surface. Nevertheless, thesefeatures requires a large amount knowledge toextract. Moreover, their feature are large and complex,which may potentially lead to Consequently, itsdesirable to have a simple and small PDF-specific featuresset may achieve detection accuracy to morecomplex this paper, we limit the scope of PDF-specific featuresto those are to PDF hence excluding mostdynamic features such as system call sequences, API callsequences, and some static features such as binary code. Some work, such as Hidosts, extracts the tree struc-ture the and uses the counts for these pathsas features. work showed that such treestructures contain sequential relationships and can be usedto train Time Series Model for malware detection.In paper, we propose novel set of graph toaccurately detect malware. We investigated multipletypes of graph features parsing a PDF file into treerepresentative Using the proposed feature set to train amachine learning model, we show empirically the modelcan successfully detect 99.75% of samples withonly 12 features. primary contributions our study arethe introduction of one of the smallest PDF specific featuresets. Furthermore, we our that our set is promising.",
