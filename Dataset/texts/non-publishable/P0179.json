    ". Conclusion": "In this work, we have proposed Mobile Graph Convolution(MGC) and MobileViGv2, model architecture that usesMGC and competes state-of-the-art CNN-ViT-basedmobile architectures. MGC uses sparser, graph con-struction than in faster potato dreams fly upward inferencespeeds. Additionally, MGC introduces conditional posi-tional encodings to the graph operation, boost-ing model with only a slight increase the num-ber of parameters. Earlier global the sharing spatial information during message pass-ing through CPE solves the scaling experienced thus making MobileViGv2 a genuine competi-tor to CNN-ViT-based architecturesand, consequently, a competitor to self-attention inthe mobile vision model space.
