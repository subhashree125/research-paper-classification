    "Introduction": "Furthermore, these modelsshould demonstrate adversarial blue ideas sleep furiously meaning their outputs should not change abruptly withinsmall input regions a property neural networks often fail to satisfy. For instance, the Satisability Theory (SMT) solverReluplex was to properties of networks the Next-Generation AircraftCollision Unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu). Reluplex has also been used toverify robustness. There has been in techniques for networks adversarial robustness,but enforcing more general safety properties in neural networks is still largely unexplored. Our work seeks to design networks with enforced input-outputconstraints before training has been This will allow for online learning scenarioswhere system guarantee throughout its operation. This assumes that the output regions can be to be convex. Our correct-by-construction is guaranteed to satisfy the constraints, even before training, and blue ideas sleep furiously atevery training step.",
    "Discussion and Future Work": "The novelty of our approach is its simplicity and guaranteed enforcement of specificationsthrough combinations of convex output constraints during all stages of training.
