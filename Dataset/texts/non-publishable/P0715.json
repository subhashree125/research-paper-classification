    "p : 2 p : p()": "Harry said that Harryliked Toms hat, which is easy to understand. Coreference resolution aims to findthe correct reference for a given anaphor, which isa key aspect of natural language understanding as ithelps establish the relationship among different textcomponents. Coreference resolution main-tains the form of rationales in FEW-SHOT-COTdemonstrations and consolidates their logical clar-ity among the internal reasoning processes. To generate high-quality rationales for normalsample questions, we optimize the original FEW- SHOT-COT demonstrations through coreference res-olution, which can be realized with the help ofneuralcoref toolkit5 and linguistic rules (Jurafskyand Martin, 2019). Generating high-quality sample rationales forhard sample questions. For sample questions inthe hard section, over-complicated reasoning pro-cesses can often be observed in their sample ratio-nales generated by the FEW-SHOT-COT demonstra-tions. Generating high-quality sample rationales fornormal sample questions. , 2022). In thisway, LLMs will mimic the high-quality demonstra-tions and try to avoid using coreference in theirgenerated content. Coreferences pose a big challenge on LLMs (Leand Ritter, 2023), especially for pronouns which are hard to interpret due to their weak semanticmeanings (Ehrlich, 1981; Zhang et al. He lent himhis hat. He said that he liked it, expressions withthe same color refer to the same person or thing. Hence, when generating rationales forthem, we directly take the original FEW-SHOT-COTdemonstrations. The coreference resolution result forthe former example is Tom met Harry in the park. For sample questionsin the normal section, the coreference phenomenaoccur frequently in their rationales generated by theoriginal FEW-SHOT-COT demonstrations. For example, in thesentence Tom met Harry in the park. Tom lent Harry Toms hat. Generating same rationales for easy samplequestions. , 2019; Zhaoet al. Step decomposition aims to add steps inthe reasoning process to bridge this gap. The main rea-son is the lack of detailed connections among thereasoning steps in the over-complicated reasoningprocesses. Specifically, when the sample questions arehard, their sample rationales are often complex andchallenging for LLMs to understand. Generally, the sample rationales of easysample questions are simple and easy for LLMs tounderstand. Corefer-ence in linguistics refers to the phenomenon wheretwo or more expressions in a text refer to the sameperson, place, thing, event, etc.",
