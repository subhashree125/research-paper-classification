    "Limitations": "The interdisciplinarynature of modern computer vision research neces-sitates expertise in areas ranging from traditionalimage processing to deep learning, computer graph-ics, and even cognitive science. The LLMs understanding and inter-pretation of complex scientific concepts may not al-ways align perfectly with human expert judgment. Firstly, our reliance on large language models(LLMs) for evaluating research abstracts, whileinnovative, introduces potential biases inherent tothese models. This limitation couldpotentially lead to oversimplification of complexresearch ideas. Whilethese elements provide a concise summary of re-search, they may not capture the full depth andnuance of the methodologies and findings pre-sented in the full papers. Assembling such panel and achieved consensus on the evaluationcriteria would be a formidable task, both in termsof logistics and resources. Furthermore, our analysis is limited to the in-formation containing in titles and abstracts. Lastly, while our study spans two decades ofCVPR proceedings, it does not account for researchpublishing in other venues or unpublished work thatmay have influenced the field.
