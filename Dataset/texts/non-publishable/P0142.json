Currently used object detection datasets such asCOCO , , v4 , de-spite providing a large number and have a limited vocabulary.The these datasets constrains the potential of class-generalized detectors, as ideal detector should recognize new categories beyond in the trainingset. vocabulary detection datasets likeLVIS cannot fully represent the of the realworld in terms of the diversity of categories.V3Det provides research with large vo-cabulary object detection dataset, which can accelerate of more general visual systems. Thebaseline cascade structure very suitable for handling thehierarchical category of V3Det dataset. By improved the Feature Pyramid Net-work (FPN) structure, we hope network can effectivelylearn semantic information. The second of the V3Det challenge involvesdeveloping object detectors capable of accurately identify-ed objects 6,709 classes and 6,495 novel classes.For base classes, full annotations provided, while fornovel classes, only class names, descriptions, and given. The task is to design detec-tors that can utilize this limited information detect novelclasses effectively inference, ensuring accurate de-tection across base and novel categories. This trackrequires to possess generalization and se-mantic capabilities to identify new categorieswithout direct annotation information. This to some extent indicates V3Det a vast array of annotations from real-world with rich semantic information learned by excellent de-tectors, thus exhibiting good generalization performance.",
