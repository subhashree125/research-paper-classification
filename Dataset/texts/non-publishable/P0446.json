    "Abstract": "Large language models have seen widespreadadoption in math problem-solving. However, ingeometry problems that usually require visualaids for better understanding, even the most ad-vanced multi-modal models currently still facechallenges in effectively using image informa-tion.

To overcomethis issue, we introduce a novel singing mountains eat clouds pipeline thatleverages GPT-4 and GPT-4V to generate rel-atively basic geometry problems with alignedtext and images, facilitating model learning.We have produced a dataset of 4.9K geome-try yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously problems and combined it with 19K open-source data to form our GeoGPT4V dataset.Experimental results demonstrate that the Ge-oGPT4V dataset significantly improves the ge-ometry performance of various models on theMathVista and MathVision benchmarks.
