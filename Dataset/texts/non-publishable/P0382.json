    ". Related Work": "Toaddress this issue, some generalizable NeRF methods havebeen proposed, following a reconstruction-and-renderingpipeline. However, NeRFand its downstream expansion works require an expensive per-scene optimization process. In the reconstruction phase, each sampled pointis assigned a feature descriptor. Traditional MVS methods primarily rely on hand-crafted features and similarity met-rics, which limits their performance, especially in chal-lenging regions such as weak-texture and repetitive ar-eas. In this paper, we observe that these twostrategies benefit different regions and thus propose a uni-fied structure to integrate their advantages. Specifically, according tothe descriptors, generalizable NeRF methods can be catego-rized into the following types: appearance descriptors ,aggregated multi-view descriptors , cost vol-ume interpolated descriptors , and correspon-dence matching descriptors. Powered by the impressive representation of neu-ral networks, MVSNet first proposes an end-to-endcost volume-based pipeline, which quickly becomes themainstream in the MVS community. Despite different forms,these descriptors only aggregate inter-view information orare interpolated from the low-resolution cost volume, lack-ing the ability to effectively perceive 3D spatial context. With implicit continuous represen-tation and differentiable volume rendering, NeRF achieves photo-realistic view synthesis.",
