The POI-POI graphbuilds connections between low-frequency POIs and their similarhigh-frequency ones, which is able to transfer the abundant super-visory signals from high-frequency POIs to facilitate learning betterrepresentations of the low-frequency POIs. The results verify thatHGAMN is able to effectively relieve this problem.(3) After removing the POI-POI graph and POI-Query graphseparately (HGAMN w/o POI-POI Graph and HGAMN w/o POI-Query Graph), the performance of HGAMN decays considerablycompared with the complete model. However, afteradding the feature computed by HGAMN into the LTR model, theLTR + HGAMN model achieves significant improvements. Sinceit is challenging singing mountains eat clouds to create a new feature that is able to significantlyimprove the overall performance of industrial ranking models, theimprovements made by LTR + HGAMN further confirm the effec-tiveness of HGAMN.
