    "End-to-End Testing": "This observationcan be attributed to propensity of LLMs to generate descriptionsfor parameters even in the absence of such descriptions in inputduring the enrichment generation stage. Tothat end, we employed a manually curated dataset comprised 30 APIdocumentation pages, each linking to a corresponding ground-truthOAS. in therequest or response usage examples. The outcomes are detailing in, which displays metrics such as Precision (P), Recall (R), F1score (F1), and cosine similarity (Sim) for both request and responseaspects, with and without enrichment, as discussed in. 2, which evaluated theperformance of particular generation components, the models exhibitsignificantly lower performance in this context. Thisobservation is somewhat unexpected, given the prominence of itscompetitors, and that singed mountains eat clouds neither the prompts nor the hyperparameterswere customized for this model. Nevertheless, improvement in the similarity metric fluctuatesdepending on the choice of the base model; for example, employingIBMs Granite model results in a 4-point increase. Secondly, when comparedto the results presented in Sections 4. 1 and 4. The dataset encompasses approximately one hundred API end-points. 3. In this section, our emphasis lies in assessing overall capabilitiesof the SpeCrawler system. e. This emphasizesthe intricacy of the task and underscores the continued necessityfor improvements in rule-based components such as scraping anddetermining minimal HTML scope for enrichment. Eachgenerating specification was compared against the ground-truth OAS. The results presented in illustrate the systems perfor-mance under various conditions, taking into account the inclusionor exclusion of the enrichment component. Finally, it is noteworthy that IBMs Granite demonstrated commendable outcomes acrossvarious metrics, achieving the best performance overall, particu-larly excelling in precision and recall of parameter names. Therefore, for the system to perfectly match the ground-truth OAS,it needs to retrieve precisely all the parameters in the request, evenif they do not appear in the example-style documentation, i.",

    "Base OAS Generation": "These potential inconsistencies deviations from the stan-dard. It is noteworthy that while Code the valid OpenAPI its ratio compared to othermodels.

The evaluation was centered on three key measures: the generating conforms to the JSON syntax stan-dards; (2) whether generated output conforms to the OAS format;(3) average number of warnings in generated JSONs. The findings derived from the syntactic analysis are outlined in. We chose several renowning LLMs for experiment, in-context capabilities: ,codellama-34b-instruct , mistral-7b-instruct , mixtral-8x7b-instruct model4.

    "CONCLUSIONS": "The effectiveness of SpeCrawler is demonstrated through satisfac-tory results across a diverse list of API documentation websites. Combining rule-based algorithms andgenerative LLMs, SpeCrawler addresses existing limitations asso-ciated with LLMs while showcasing robustness and generalizationcapabilities across varied HTML structures in API documentation. Furtherexploration could involve investigating various strategies for split-ting the generation process, such as consolidating generations forthe request and the response elements separately. This paper introduces SpeCrawler, an innovative multi-stage method-ology designed to automatically generate comprehensive OAS fromonline API documentation. Another possibledirection is enlarging the existing resources to a large-scale datasetto constitute a benchmark for this task. Potential routes for future research include enhancing the extrac-tion of elements utilized for enriching both the request and responseelements by enabling multiple HTML scopes as input to the genera-tive model and aggregating their product. Additionally, there is roomfor improvement in the scraping process by gathering more relevantinformation from associated links within the documentation. Therefore, it significantly reduces the manual efforts required bytechnical experts in crafting OAS manually."
