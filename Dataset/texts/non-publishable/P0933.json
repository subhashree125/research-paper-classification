    "DISCUSSION": "Apparently, the quality of the text generated by the LLM seemshigher than what the sta write on the RoX records: it shows moreclarity, better diction, and better spelling. Nevertheless, there areno safety guarantees against hallucinations, and state-of-the-artLLMs are also subject to irrational behavior and reasoning break-down even on simple tasks. This section brainstorms some avenues of im-provement to increase this robustness indicator up to higher qual-ity standards, considering the specic challenges of complex indus-trial environments, and to eventually demonstrate the technologyin an operational environment (TRL 67). This early stage of maturity corresponds toa standard ISO 16290 Technology Readiness Level (TRL) between4 and 5, because it has been validated in some real-world relevantenvironments. Up to this point, the approach presented in this workshop paperhas described basic principles of its causal RCA and SolutionGeneration technology, and an initial experimental proof of con-cept has been shown.",
