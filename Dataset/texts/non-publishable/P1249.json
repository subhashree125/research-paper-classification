In fact, this kind of exponential growth was characteristicof the model under a variety of settings, practically any configuration which would not resultin the population dying out would feature it growing exponentially. Whether this aligns withhistorical data is debatable; the colonial period did indeed show a quadruple increase in the totalarea farmed .There is rapid capital accumulation in the Capitalist economy, see a. Given the averagerice price of one, our Capitalist is consistently worth more than the entire output of society.",
