    "||K1v||,(1)": "where K is intrinsic matrix, v V is the homoge-neous coordinate of a pixel, and vsp is the projectedlocation.To warp a completed view A to novel viewB, where R is the rotation matrix from A to B, we ro-tate each projected vertex vsp of A by vrot = Rvsp, andthen perform rasterization-based rendering (I, M) =rasterize(Vrot, E, K) where Vrot is the set of rotated verticesand K is the intrinsic matrix of image B. output I is awarped image and M is a binary mask indicating whetherinpainting is required for a pixel (obtained by checking foreach pixel whether ray-casting hits a valid mesh face).To ensure the local inpainting consistency of eachperspective view, we use a large field of view (FoV) andadjust the rotation angles so that both known and unknownregions are reasonably large after warping. In practice, aFoV of 100 degrees with roughly 40 degrees of rotationbetween adjacent views works well.To further reducethe iterative error accumulation, we expand scenealternatively from both sides of the input image, ratherthan expanding in a single direction. To ensure a smooth360 loop closure, we tune the rotation angles so thatthe final view has a large incomplete region at the center,resulted in a sequence of views with rotation angles of{0, 41, 41, 82, 82, 123, 200.5(for loop closure)}.",
