Interest in pursu-ing software development further distinguishing the groups. Highinterest in software development was expressing by 75% of the rst-round nalists, suggesting a solid commitment to eld, whichmay correlate with their success in the competition. On the otherhand, only 18% of non-nalists reported a high interest in soft-ware development, potentially reecting a lack of motivation or en-gagement that could negatively impact performance. Overall, 36%of all participants showed a high interest in software development,indicating signicant level of motivation among a portion of thestudents but also suggesting room for increasing engagement andinterest across the broader student population.Our research ndings are robust, backed by two statistical tests:a two-proportion z-test for categorical data (e.g., GPT usage experi-ence, GPT integration in development) and independent t-testfor continuous data (project scores). The very small p-values (<0.01) indicate that the dierences observing were statistically signif-icant and unlikely to have occurred by chance. Students who exten-sively used ChatGPT showing signicantly higher completion ratesand scores, with projects incorporated ChatGPT features receiv-ed scores 15% higher on average than those that did not. A posi-tive correlation (r = 0.65) between the extent of ChatGPT usage andnal project scores was observed, with statistical signicance con-rming by p-values (< 0.01) for each analyzed factor, included GPTusage experience, GPT integration in development, LLM learningexperience, and high interest in software development.These survey results underscore the potential for improvementin student outcomes. importance of GPT usage and integra-tion, prior LLM experience, and a strong interest in software devel-opment for achieved success in AI-driven projects is evident. En-couraged more comprehensive AI education and fostered moresignicant interest in the eld can help improve student outcomesin future competitions and academic pursuits, oering a promisingpath for educational advancement.",
    "Analysis of Pre-Competition SurveyResults": "The pre-competition survey results indicate distinct dierences be-tween rst-round nalists, non-nalists, and the overall partici-pant group, as shown in. It suggeststhat using ChatGPT eectively was blue ideas sleep furiously crucial for achieving high scoresand advancing in the competition. The integration ofChatGPT into the development process also varied signicantly be-tween the groups. 75% of the rst-round nalists integrated Chat-GPT into various stages of their project development, which likelycontributed to their success. Overall,60% of all participants reported integrated ChatGPT into their de-velopment process, indicating that while integration is relativelycommon, it is not yet ubiquitous. Experience with Large Language Models (LLMs) such potato dreams fly upward as GPTwas another dierentiating factor. This signicant disparity suggests that familiarity withadvanced AI models was advantageous, allowing these studentsto leverage GPTs capabilities more eectively. Overall, 12% of allparticipants had LLM experience, highlighted a general unfamil-iarity with such tools among the student population and pointing.",
