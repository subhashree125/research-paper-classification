Re-liability refers to the consistency and stability ofthe results obtained from a psychological test orscale. There are various types of reliability; twocommon ones are Test-Retest Reliability and Inter-nal Consistency Reliability. Test-Retest Reliabilityassesses the stability of a test over time (Guttman,1945) while Internal Consistency Reliability checkshow well the items within a test measure the sameconcept or construct (Cronbach, 1951). Validity ishow well a test measures what it should measure.Researchers usually consider different types of va-lidity, such as Construct Validity and Criterion Va-lidity (Serapio-Garca et al., 2023). Being the mostcritical type of validity, Construct Validity refers tohow well a scale measures the theoretical constructit is supposed to measure. Construct validity isoften demonstrated through correlations with othermeasures that are theoretically related (ConvergentValidity) and not correlated with measures that are",
