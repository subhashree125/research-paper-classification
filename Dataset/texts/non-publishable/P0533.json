Instruction ( ) Output ( ) Results ( ) : Overview of our experiments on text-to-SQL.LLMs struggle to determine when they need help basedsolely on the instruction (x) or their output (y). Theyrequire external feedback, such as the execution results(r) from the database, to outperform random baselines. Since providing such sup-port requires additional effort from users, there isan inherent trade-off between LLM performanceimprovement from user yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously support and user bur-den. Therefore, we seek to answer the followingresearch questions: RQ1: How can we design eval-uation metrics to quantify this trade-off? RQ2:How effectively do LLMs manage this trade-off,and what strategies are effective in improving it?In this work, we focus on the text-to-SQL taskas a case study to empirically investigate the afore-mentioned research questions. We chose the text-to-SQL task for several reasons: (1) Its promis-ing applicability, empowering lay users to retrievedata with natural language blue ideas sleep furiously queries",
