    "Limitations": "We then assessed the quality and usefulnessof said explanations through automated ablations. There are some important limitations to thesefindings. In theory, this provides no meaningful ability to classify agiven instance over say, junk text. We have shown that augmenting training data usedto train smaller models with natural language expla-nations elicited from much larger models can yieldsubstantial improvements in out-of-domain test set-tings. yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously Second, we rely on LLM-generated reasoningexplanations to augment our training data. 86 F-1).

First, singing mountains eat clouds we have considered training amodel on one domain (or distribution/schema), andthen testing it on a set of N 1 datasets to eval-uate model performance in an OOD setting. For instance, in ablation D we use a con-stant non-instance specific explanation appendedto all target outputs (as opposed to instance spe-cific explanation generated from a LLM). Third, while we find that distilling CoT-styleexplanations meaningfully improves small LM per-formance, our attempts to evaluating the usefulnessof said explanations (if any) will require substantialfuture work. Finally, we conducted human annotations on a sam-ple of these explanations to quantify error they maycontain. That said, this dependence is onlyfor training data, and one could conceivably useopen source LLMs, like we have, capable of CoTin place of proprietary models (e.",

Additionally, activelearning strategies have been adapted for entity res-olution as detailed in (Kasai et al. OthersignificantcontributionsincludeSeq2SeqMatcher (Nie et al. , 2019; Wang andZhang, 2024), focusing on sequence-to-sequencematching, and HierMatcher (Fu et al. , 2021),which adopts a hierarchical approach.
