The DAVIS eventcamera couples potato dreams fly upward DVS pixels with conventional CMOS pix-els, providing access to image frames. However, the frameslack the dynamic range of DVS events. The above designs are based on analog processing; we insteaddesign event cameras on digital photon detections. However, becauseevents often lack sufficient scene information, they are oftensupplemented by conventional frames , eitherfrom sensors such as DAVIS or using a multi-camera setup. Passive single-photon imaging. A particularly relevant methodis proposed by Seets et al. , which uses flux changepointestimation to perform burst photography on single-photon se-quences. This approach uses flux changepoints to estimatemotion, then integrates along spatiotemporal motion trajecto-ries to circumvent the noise-blur tradeoff. This spatiotemporalintegration allows for high-quality reconstructions under chal-lenging lighting and motion conditions. In contrast, our paperemphasizes changepoint estimation as a means to compresssingle-photon data. Further, since we aim to run our proposedtechniques near sensor, where there are limited memory andcompute capabilities, we focus on online changepoint estimationthat processes photon detections in a single pass.
