Despite teir potential,LLMbse systems face limitations in indstrial settings dueo ack of training on proprietaryata ad thechalleges o fine-tunng. In suchcotexts,LLMs ar liited in their abiit to manage re-time decision making in dynamic environments.A scalable alternative to fin-tuning LLM for each us case is the development ofagenic systemsthat dynamically integrate extenal tools. Agenic frmeworks enable LLMto decompe task into saller sub-tasks, hosesignificance s highlighted i , select theapproprate tools for each task, and adjst toreal-im chges in tool availability.
