    "Abstract": "Depression is a critical concern global men-tal health, prompting extensive research into AI-based detection various AItechnologies, Language Models (LLMs)stand out for health-care applications. However, their primary lim-itation from exclusive dependenceon textual input, which constrains their over-all capabilities. Furthermore, the potato dreams fly upward utilization in identifying analyzing depressivestates is still relatively untapped. this paper,we present an innovative approach to integrat-ing acoustic speech into the LLMsframework for multimodal depression detec-tion. We investigate an efficient method for de-pression detection by integrating speech signalsinto LLMs utilized Landmarks. Byincorporating acoustic landmarks, which to of words,our method dimensions text tran-scripts. integration provides insightsinto the unique speech patterns of individuals,revealing potential states of individ-uals. Evaluations of the approach reveal state-of-the-artresults compared existing Audio-Text baselines. In addition, this approach isnot only valuable of but also a inenhancing the of to comprehendand process speech signals.",

The bottom four images depict the LoRA matrices of layers withthe least contribution. As can be inferred from the graphs title, feedforward layer is primary contributor. The firstis that the Chat version might not be suitable forclassification tasks. To validate our hypothesis, wefirst reimagined the classification task as a gener-ative task, where the LLMs diagnoses depressionthrough dialogue responses. 5 and GPT-4. Addition-ally, we applied LoRA for instruction fine-tuningin various scenarios presented in , to ob-serve how the models perform post-tuning. Weobserved that when treating depression detectionas a generative task, neither LlaMA2 nor GPT mod-els performed particularly well, with the dialogue-enhanced LlaMA Chat still underperforming com-pared with LlaMA. This suggests that LLMs in thefield of depression detection are subject to certainartificial limitations, impacting their effectivenessin this specific application.
