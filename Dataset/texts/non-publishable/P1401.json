    "arXiv:2412.04469v1 [cs.CV] 5 Dec 2024": "Extensiveablations show the efficacy of the various components of our approach. Recently, Sun et al. Unsurprisingly, they suffer from slow rendering speeds. Once learned,we efficiently encode the integer latents via entropy coding to achieve high compression factors. g. It requires incremental on-the-fly updates to volumetric representation at each time-stepof dynamic scene, fast training and rendering times to maintain real-time operation, and smallpacket sizes per frame to enable effective transmission on bandwidth-limiting channels. Online FVV, e. To reduce memory requirements, however, learnsonly subset of the Gaussian attributes at each time-step, limiting model expressiveness. , for broadcast and teleconferencing applications, presents additional challengesversus offline. While these representations accurately model 4D scenes, they are trained in anoffline fashion required full multi-view video sequences to learn temporal relationships betweenframes. Similarly to prior approaches , we also learn Gaussian attributeresiduals between consecutive time-steps. In this work, we propose a novel QUantizing and Efficient ENcoding (QUEEN) framework, whichuses 3D-GS for online FVV. Finally, to achieve furtherefficiencies in terms of training time and storage, we utilize the differences between the 2D viewspaceGaussian gradients of consecutive frames to initialize our learnable gates, and to selectively renderlocal image regions corresponding to highly dynamic scene content. , motionand illumination changes. Specifically, to achieve this, we propose a learned quantization-sparsity framework to simultaneouslylearn and compress Gaussian attribute residuals for each time-step. For position residuals that exhibit greater sensitivity to quantization, we propose learned gatingmechanism to sparsify them, which identifies the static (corresponding to 0 value) and dynamicGaussians and retains the sparse dynamic ones only at full precision. Notable prior solutions are those based on NeRFs using voxel grids or triplanes to learn3D representations that are updated on-the-fly. Our second insight, then, is to learn todirectly compress the Gaussian residuals in proportion to the real-time scene dynamics, e. Lastly, we alsoexploit temporal redundancies across time-steps to limit computations to highly dynamic parts ofthe scene only and achieve further efficiencies. Consequently,the more challenging problem of online FVV reconstruction remains relatively under-explored. proposed 3DGStream , which uses 3D-GS to model 3D scene along withInstantNGP to model its geometric transformation over time. However, NeRFs require compositing denseinformation across 3D volume and hence are slow to train and render. It achieves high rendering speedsbut imposes heuristic structural constraints on the volumetric representation to achieve efficiency,which compromises model expressiveness and quality. QUEEN outperforms all prior state-of-the-artapproaches for online FVV and significantly reduces the per-frame memory cost (10), all whileachieving higher reconstruction quality, as well as faster training and rendering speeds. However, encoding all Guassian attributes increases the per frame memory requirement and hencenecessitates a means to compress them more effectively. They also require long training times to achieve high reconstruction quality and are mostlynot streamable. Our firstinsight, therefore, is to model residuals for all attributes instead, which does not compromise quality. g.",
