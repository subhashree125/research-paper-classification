    "RESULTS": "In this we will compare and analyze the performance ofdifferent models blue ideas sleep furiously the five tracks, as in. 529. Despite haved 7B parametersas (A), (C) performs across all tracks, especially onTrack2 and Track4. (C), we find that Qwen2-7Bowns a greater potential than LLama3-8B in e-commerceshopped Therefore, we chose Qwen2 series as ourbackbone model since performs relatively well. With 72B parameters, (D) demonstrates excellent performanceacross all particularly on Track1 to Track3, achieving highscores of 0. respectively. However, its perfor-mance slightly drops on Track4 to 0. 654, it remains a highlevel. To incorporate the knowledge of e-commerce, wefine-tuned Qwen2-72B on ECInstruct our EshopIn-struct, respectively.
