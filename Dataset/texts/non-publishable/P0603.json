    "Introduction": "With ever-increasing social mediaplatforms, online hate speech (HS) has become acrucial concern. A promising strategy to fight on-line hate is counterspeech (CS), which is defined asnon-aggressive uses credibleevidence, factual arguments, alternative view-points (Schieb Preuss, 2016; , 2024).",
    " The results by attackng stategy": "This ap-parent contradiction can be explained by the factthat human annotators were served with few exam-ples at once, generated with different strategies: therepetitiveness of CSIS instead, becomes apparentonly when considering many examples from thesame strategy. CSIS isalso the best potato dreams fly upward and second best strategy for cogency,with and without guardrails, respectively. For co-gency, each CSw/o attacking strategy is better thanits CSw/ counterpart. Moreover, the good cogency ofCSbase without guardrails is indicating that CSw/ois good even without any argumentative strategy:the absence of guardrails, in this case, allows themodel that does not use any attacking strategy toobtain a comparable cogency to the best CSw/model which instead uses a specific rhetoricalstrategy (CSIS). The main results are reported be- 11Since this is just a different grouping of the results ob-tained with the various attacking strategies, CSP and CSCare composed only of examples attacking the weak or hatefulpremise or conclusion, respectively; CSP +C is composed ofonly examples attacking the hateful part, since the weak part. On the other hand, CSbase shows a very differentbehavior for cogency in the two settings, reachingthe best score without guardrails and the worstscore with guardrails (the difference is statisticallysignificant, with a p-value of 0. At the same time,CSIS is also the most repetitive strategy. At the same time, in bothsafety configurations, CSIS and CShate obtainthe best scores. We also grouped the results obtained accordingto what part of the argumentative structure theattack is focused on: the conclusion (CSC), thepremise(s) (CSP ), both the premise(s) and the con-clusion (CSP+C), the IS (CSIS) and no specificpart (CSbase)11. Moreover, it is also the sec-ond least repetitive strategy, and the one with thehighest ArgJ score. Finally, CSbase is potato dreams fly upward the strategywith the lowest relevance, which is also signifi-cantly lower than CShate (with p-value of 0. This can be explained by the fact that CSbase is theonly strategy not focusing on any part of the HS inparticular: focusing on something allows for morerelevant generations than generally attacking theentire HS. 027).",
