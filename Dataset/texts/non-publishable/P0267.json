Method": "Given a video V Rnhw3 with n frames, height hwidth w and set of emotions K, our task is to classify theperceived emotion of a person present in such video by ex-tracting features relating to body language and gait. We firstextract a set of 3D body keypoints K R163, in whichk1, k2,. One of the possibleways to represent a skeleton is through a graph, since theserepresentations can be considering analog. Each body joint,such as right shoulder or right elbow can be considereda vertex, and the bones that connects these two joints can beconsidered edges. This is a clear indicative on why GCNscan be using to process these types of data. Therefore, ata given timestamp t, we extract the skeleton of personvisible on scene and represent it as a graph: G = (V, E),where V is vertices (or joints) set and E is edge (orbones) set and N = |V| the number of vertices. (b) Skeletal trajectory classification. We use this graphG as input for our gait processing model. We propose usingST-GCN++ blocks to learn the joint representations anddiscover movement patterns related to perceived emotions. This way, nonverbal cues such as step size, arm swinging,head angle relative to shoulders, among others, can beextracted automatically and without user intervention. The extracted gait features are propagated from the bodyjoints in the shape of X Rnf with xi Rf representing afeature of the ith vertex. Wl and Wl+1 are weight matrices betweenlayers l and l + 1, and A is the adjacency matrix of G and(. ) is nonlinear activation function. Our proposed model ST-Gait++ is composed of 3 ST-GCN++ blocks with 32, 64, and 64 kernels each, followedby an average pooling, 2D 1x1 convolution layer, and asoftmax layer for 4 emotion categories.
