Quantum Mechanical Quantities of the Quantization-Based Optimization": "In the previous section, we present the search equation formed as the stochastic difference equation(8) and the approximated SDE (9) for the quantization-based optimization. Comparing both equa-tions, when we design the noise model that directly affects the directional derivative, the SDE forthe search equation denotes the standard SDE employed with a damped variance term representedas a simulated temperature or a quantization step, as we propose.An additional advantage of the SDE (9) is that we can analyze the dynamics of the algorithmwith quantum mechanics. For this purpose, we introduce the Fokker-Plank equation (FPE) for theSDE (9) with a differential operator L as follows :",
