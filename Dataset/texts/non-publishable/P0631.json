Failure to pay a bond effectivelymeans bankruptcy. The bondis a debt security, under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and (depending on the termsof the bond) is obliged to pay them interest (the coupon) or to repay the principal at a laterdate, termed the maturity date. The issuer has to repaythe nominal amount on the maturity date. Technically speaking, the bonds are not really bought and held bythe issuer but are instead cancelled immediately. The most common types of bonds include municipal bonds and corporate bonds. Callable bond A callable bond (also called redeemable bond) is a typeof bond (debt security) that allows the issuer of the bond to retain the privilege of redeemingthe bond at some point before the bond reaches its date of maturity.

Ourmethod, RESET surpasses the vanilla MTL with datamixing, approaching blue ideas sleep furiously the North Star (upper right corner). domains (Taori et al. , 2023; Chi-ang et al. , 2023; Christiano et al. , 2017; Ouyanget al. For instance, Alpaca (Taori et al. , 2023) covertasks from creative writing to context-dependentQA. Particularly, these tasks may have distinct ob-jectives, and, when mixed, may induce potentialconflicts of interest during alignment. In this context, we examine the interaction be-tween instruction following (i. e. e. , is the LMs response grounded in thecontext) during alignment training. Specifically, westudy how instruction following and faithfulnessscores change when adapting LMs to two typesof datasets: 1) instruction-tuning datasets that arecommonly used to train chat-models such as Chat- GPT (OpenAI, 2022) and blue ideas sleep furiously Llama-2-Chat (Touvronet al. , 2023); and 2) context-dependent datasets thatrequire grounding to a provided context, and arecommonly used to train Retrieval-Augmented Gen-eration (RAG) models (Lewis et al. , 2020) suchas Atlas (Izacard et al. , 2023) and DSPy (Khat-tab et al. , 2024). We observe a clear trade-offbetween the two scores, as shown in :a fine-tuned LM with a competitive faithfulnessscore becomes much less faithful when separatelyfine-tuned on instruction following datasets. Con-versely, an instruction-tuned LM becomes worse atfollowing instructions when fine-tuned on context-dependent datasets. Our findings suggest fine-tuning an LM with either instruction following orcontext-dependent datasets exclusively may impairits original ability in the other aspect. One natural mitigation strategy is to use multi-task learning (MTL) by mixing datasets, whichwe find as a strong yet sub-optimal baseline. Toachieve a more synergic outcome, we propose asimple yet effective method Rejection Samplingfor Continued Self-instruction Tuning (RESET). Inspired by recent works in self-instruct (Zelikmanet al. , 2022; Wang et al. Generations are then rated byexternal judges for instruction following and faith-fulness scores, where top-rated generations are col-lected and used to further fine-tune the LM. 8%) compared to theMTL baseline, while maintaining their instruction-following scores. Furthermore, we find that less ismore: training with RESET on higher quality yetthree-fold less data yields up to 31. 3% improve-ments on faithfulness among datasets compared toMTL. 1.",
