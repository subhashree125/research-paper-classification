MUSER represents thecomplete model performance, MUSER-RM represents theremoval of the multi-step retrieval module and MUSER-RSrepresents the removal of the text summary module. of retrieval steps to conduct experiments, and then compare it tothe model with the key evidence selection function.Firstly, we can find that in experiments where key evidence se-lection is not enabled, as the number of retrievals increases, theperformance decreases instead. This is because there is no evidencescreening for the retrieved paragraphs, which may contain redun-dant information, leading to a decrease in performance.Secondly, we observe that enabling key evidence selection resultsin improved performance compared to the scenario where keyevidence selection is not enabled. In the key evidence selectionstage, our model determines whether the current retrieval resultsinclude key evidence. When key evidence is successfully retrieved,the iterative retrieval process is halted to minimize the interferencecaused by redundant information. In other words, the selectionstrategy follows an exploratory approach, where the emphasis ison exploring relevant information first. Importantly, increasing thenumber of retrieval steps does not result in an increase in redundantinformation. The key takeaway from this experiment is that multiple retrievalsteps consistently improve performance compared to single-step re-trieval. That is, even if relevant evidence passages are not retrievedin the initial step, the retriever will continue in the subsequent iter-ative retrieval process. The performance of the model reaches itspeak around 2 to 3 retrieval steps. Beyond this point, increasing thenumber of steps does not yield significant benefits and, in fact, leadsto a degradation in performance. Interestingly, despite variations inthe difficulty level of the datasets, the optimal number of retrievalsteps remains consistent.",
