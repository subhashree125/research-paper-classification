    "Static adversarial training": "Fine-tuning to refuse jailbreaks and adversarial training increases robustness in broad domains, so we investigate how this performs on our bomb-defense problem.Compared togpt-3.5-turbo-1106 (the base model which our fine-tuning was done on top of), our fine-tuned models (adv-sft-op{1,2,3}) demonstrate superior resilience against both static jail-breaks and PAIR attacks. PAIR attacks elicited 338 responses flagged by our classifier for thegpt-3.5-turbo-1106 but only a single flagged response across adv-sft-op{1,2,3}, which wasdetermined to be a false positive. The strong performance is not surprising since PAIR-generated jailbreaks are close in distributionto the static jailbreaks we fine-tuned to refuse. However, despite improved robustness, all operatingpoints have generalization issues since all are still vulnerable to dry-ice attacks. Finally, only adv-sft-op3 proved robust against generating competent failures when tested withadversarial suffixes identified through our random search attack. Nonetheless, it generated a bor-derline example (shown in Appendix E.1), suggesting that further tuning of prompts or algorithmhyperparameters could potentially result in a successful, competent failure.",
    "arXiv:2412.02159v1 [cs.LG] 3 Dec 2024": "However, even in this narrower and easier setting, we find that existing defensemechanisms are unable to fully solve the LLM bomb-defense problem. Each defense we testincluded safety training , adversarial training , and LLM-based classifiers exhibits at least one vulnerability. In light of the failure of existed methods, we attempt to develop our own classifier defense, whichemploys prompting and parsing strategies (see .1) to try and solve the bomb-defense problem.Our classifier is transcript-based, allowing access to both the models input and output to decidewhether interaction is harmful. While our classifier defense outperforms existed defenses onmany axes, we find that it, too, can ultimately be broken. Moreover, attempts to further improve ourclassifier defense either degrade its capabilities or fail to enhance its overall robustness. Our findings reveal that jailbreak defense is a challenged problem even when the jailbroken behaviorthat is trying to be prevented is very narrowly-defined. We believe that attempting to build defensesthat work for this narrow setting may yield insights into how to defend against jailbreaks in moregeneral settings.",

    "Prioritized sampling methodTo efficiently identify and review potentially harmful model outputs,we first define a set of egregious words relevant to the domain for example, shrapnel\" and": "blasting-cap\" in the context of bomb-making (see the in We calculate anegregiousness score for each by counting occurrences these words making the textlowercase and removing Outputs with scores below a certain threshold are discarded, are unlikely be Similarly, discard with excessively scores, whichmay indicate issues or repetitions. We also discard that contain phrases or flagged defense harmful since care more about finding Finally, we randomly sample the remaining outputs human inspection. This methodallows us focus our on responses most likely critical harmful ingredients andmethodologies. Attack Success RateWe the of an against defenses classifiersused attack success rate (ASR), which represents the proportion of successful attacks accorded tohuman judgment. Due to limited human capacity, we sometimes produce lower bound onASR by employing prioritized sampling. AlpacaEval Refusal RateClassifier defenses can use an adjustable threshold that balances preci-sion and recall. Therefore, assess attack strength with AlpacaEval rate. To we get responses all AlpacaEval and jailbreak requests, recording the classifiers harmfuloutput We determine refusal for AlpacaEval requests when all jailbreaks aredefended (i.e. when the threshold is set the harmful probability in jailbreak responses).For instance, if jailbreak successful by a human is classified completely harmless classifier (zero harm probability), all benign requests would be refused, leading to 100% refusalrate. We choose use a threshold of 5% determine if a defense is compromisedsince it a significant compromise on benign",
