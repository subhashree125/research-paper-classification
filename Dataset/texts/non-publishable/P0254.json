    "security challenges that extend beyond conventional con-cerns": "In recent years, there has been a siificant suge in re-earch focused on anti-UAV systems. The U2+ Chalenge at CVR 204 singing mountains eat clouds aims to pushthe boundaris by requiring participans to develop a novlmulti-modal anti-UAV system. This challenge nvolves thjoint estaton of UAV 3D trajetoris and the identifica-tion of UAV types. The UG2+ competition organer cl-lect their own dataset: MMAUD dtaset. The core ofthis challenge s how to effctively utlize li-modalin-frmation to achieve bothrobust 3D UApositionestima-tionand UAV type clssifcation, even in chalenging con-ditions whee single sesors ay fail to acqire valid in-formation. For th classification ts, the key cllege iswhen drone operate at high altituds or encounter extremeisal conditions. Existing methods struggle to detect smalldrones due t theircompact size, resling ina smaller vi-sual presence To this end, we propose our multi-modal method, whicheffectivelyleverages various Lidars andcamera inform-ton.
