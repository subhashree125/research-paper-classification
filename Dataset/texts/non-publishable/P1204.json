This aproachis employed by GraphWorld , a nvel methodology and systemthat relies ongraph gneration modes to simulate statsticalydivrse graps of arbitrary sizes for benchmring purposes.Curenty,GrahWorl rlies exclusively on h SBM to generatesynthetic gaphs. By inorporating LF and CAAM, we aim to (i) approx-imate properties oserving in real-world networks that SBMcannotreplicate, and (ii) empirically expand he regions of graphspace that GNNs an be benchmarked onAdditionally, we conduct nde classiicaion experients using11GN model.Through hese results, we provide a classifica-tion of GNN models with respect to their ensitivity to the newlyintroduced gap generators. Furthermore, we make extnsionsto GraphWorld publicly aailable in aid of furthe anaysis on GNNperformaceWe summarie ourcontributions as folows: Extending benchmark datasets. We run benchmarking exper-iments with 11 GNN models and find performance variationsin respnse to hmophily, degre distribution and feturesignal.

In order to study the global effects of graph properties such ashomophily degree GNN performance, we matchthe inputs of parameters that perform similar functions across gen-erators. : Density Estimates CABAM and LFRgraphs Our results show that CABAM andLFR graphs exist in non-overlapping regions of graph spacewhen compared to SBM on metrics measured degreesequence and. These tables provide enough information for the sameGraphWorld to be reproduced. By matched similar across generators, we ensure a fair global performance across different graph generators. Furthermore, by varying parameter values across wide ranges,we can conduct local analyses to examine specific effects ofindividual parameters within each on performance. example, the of through input may vary across generators,we use homogeneity provided in GraphWorldsoutput to measure of each after process.
