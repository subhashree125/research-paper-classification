    "arXiv:2411.04265v1 [stat.ML] 6 Nov 2024": "It generalizes GNNs and is naturally suiting for taking into account information flows alongpaths traversing several distinct graphs. We show with simple numerical experiments that our theoretical bounds seem tight. Our approach is motivatedby theory of switching dynamical systems, where recent algorithmic tools have improved our un-derstanding of the iterative behaviour of non-commuting operators. Contrary to someprior results, under the convergence we consider in this paper, there is no no-transferable energy,meaning that the graphon-graph transferability error goes to zero as the size of the graph goes toinfinity. This choice allows us to prove stronger stability and transferability bounds thatwhen restricted to classical GNNs improve upon or complement the state-of-the-art theory. The stabletraining procedure could be considered of independent interest (see, for instance, ). The seminal work has used theory ofgraphons to carry out these two steps, providing a solid theoretical foundation to transferabilityproperties of GNNs. In many practical situations a fixed collection of entities serves as common vertices to several dis-tinct graphs simultaneously that represent several modalities of the same underlying object. This architecture replaces the polynomials h(X) underly-ing graph convolutional neural networks with non-commutative polynomials h(X1,. This is in part possible because the number of parameters that defines aGNN is independent of size of the input graphs. However,there is a crucial difference: whereas the main results in the articles above refer to the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, we define and analyze block-operator-norms on non-commutative algebras actingon function spaces. Our bounds are furthermore easily computable in terms of networks parameters improving onthe results of and in particular allow us to devise novel training algorithms with stability guar-antees. The most closely relating existing work is the algebraic neural network theory ofParada-Mayorga, Butler and Ribeiro who pioneer the use of algebras of non-commutingoperators. We call this model graph-tuple neural networks(GtNNs). In we provide experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world movie recommendation datasetwhere two graphs are extracted from incomplete tabular data. It occurs in the analysis of social networks singing mountains eat clouds because individualsoften participate in several distinct social/information networks simultaneously and in a wide arrayof multimodal settings. idea is conceptually related to the algebraicnotion of representation stability that has been recently studied in the context of machine learningmodels. The stability bounds we obtain arewithin a small factor of the empirical stability errors. And remarkably, the bounds exhibit samequalitative behavior as the empirical stability error. In par-ticular, we complement work in by delivering bounds that do not exhibit no-transferable energy,and we complement results in by providing stability bounds that do not require convergence. Our contributions. More precisely, if two graphs describe similar phenomena, then a given GNN shouldhave similar repercussions (i. Thisoccurs, for instance, in recommendation systems where the items can be considered as vertices ofseveral distinct similarity graphs. More generally our approach via operator networksgives a general and widely applicable parametrization for such networks. In order to describethis property precisely, it is necessary to place signals and shift operators on different graphs (of po-tentially different sizes) in equal footed to allow for meaningful comparisons and to characterizefamilies of graphs describing similar phenomena. Our main theoretical result is a Universal transferability Theorem for graphon-graph transference whichguarantees that every graphon-tuple neural network (without any assumptions) is transferable oversequences of graph-tuples generating from a given graphon-tuple. This means that whatever a GtNNlearns on a graph-tuple with sufficiently many vertices, instantaneously transfers with small error toall other graph-tuples of sufficiently large size providing the graph-tuples we are considering describea similar phenomenon in the sense that they have a common graphon-tuple limit. e.",
