    "Asessing shift in atent space": "Theassessment of the distribution shifts is done by applying a statistical summary. This approach of using a data descriptorwas also applied in , and is commonly used in methods based on kernel projections. The distance matrix has the information betweenthe projected point and the cluster centers. This methodological approach is illustrated in. There are even problems in cases where the coordinates are not natural inany sense. Therefore, the relative locations of the point cloud in the latent space are computed by calculating thedistances between the mass centers and the projected points. We use relative locations instead of directly working with the coordinatesof points in the latent space generated by the DR method. Note that the approach is general in the sense that any type of DR technique can be used. Hence, our focus is on the geometric properties of thelatent space, independent of the chosen coordinates in the latent space. The coordinates are arbitrarily selected and often do notconsider any property of the data itself. Once the DR mapping is done, a distance matrix is computed. Here, we modify theframework introduced in , which is based on distances and statistical summaries of the points in the latent space, toan approach that assesses topological changes according to the homological characteristics of the points in the latentspace. Recently, it was introduced a clustering method based in SOM for assessing distribution changes in data streams withhigh dimensional data. SOM is used for projecting the input data into a latent space, then the analysis is donein the latent space, where the authors computed a distance matrix between the input pattern and cluster centers.",

The chunk size should be determined through experimentation, taking this account."
