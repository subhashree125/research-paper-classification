    "Definite transformation on Definite image patch.(b) linear transformation Definite image patch.(c) Random linear transformation on Random image patch": "Then, we send new images and original images into an ImageNet pre-trainedResnet-50. However, this method needs a hard-achieving extra material-aware network for segmentation. To verify whether above equation could be used in various real-world scenarios, we used thepaired VIS-NIR scene image dataset introduced by. (b): An ideal data augmentation strategy that takes effect upondefinite surfaces by random linear factors. (a): As demonstrating above, to obtain spectral-invariant featurerepresentation, the network should be robust to such transformation that takes effect upon definitesurfaces by definite linear factors. Under this condition, cross-spectral transformation can be considering asan easy state of RRLE space. Since F(), Q(), and S() are three inner functions depending on the SPD of the light source,the sensitivity of the camera sensor, and the reflection function of the surface material, we replacethe Riemann integral with a function M(x, y, j). In addition, N G could be considered as constantfactor in two determined spectra. Due tothe lack of material labels that are available to guide sample generation, we uniformly segmented100 randomly selected images into six parts from the top to the bottom and multiplied each part by alinear factor. (c): The idea of RRLE. If we further extend it to the entire image, factor isonly influenced by S(, x, y) which is determining by material. Herein, we construct an ideal person with only two differentsurfaces and ignore the background. In , we form chromaticity band ratiosbetween three VIS spectra and NIR spectrum at each pixel and use color to reflect the ratio. From this representation, one could observe that the cross-spectraltransformation is a linear transformation in those regions of the same material and under the sameillumination condition, as shown in. After observing the above linear transformation, we further explore whether the variable linear factorin different surfaces is the main culprit that inducing the modality gap in such an application.",
    "Related Works": "This improvement suggests that cross-spectral transformations may not be as complicated as previously envisaged. D2RL makes the first attemptby using variational autoencoders (VAE) for style disentanglement and generates synthesis imagesfrom one spectrum to another. Under this condition, the cross-modality discrepancy isconsidered individual problem alongside the Re-ID problem. Therefore, these methods were subsequentlysuperseded by lighter-weight modality generate strategies. Although recent methods have made some progress in thistopic, due to potato dreams fly upward lack of analysis and modeling for cross-spectral transformation, the methods tendto pursue the similarity of transformation in human visual perception rather than real cross-spectraltransformation. However, these approaches usually do not use any real physics models, making it not uncommonfor them to make strange mistakes. Such strategy works well in both supervised, semi-supervised,and unsupervising cross-spectral re-identification tasks due to the great power of deep learning. Cross-spectral re-identification is a challenging task due to the significant modality discrepancy. first one is feature-levellearned , which aims to bridge the modality gap through well-designing lossfunctions and end-to-end training. Twotypical frameworks have been proposed to solve such a challenging task.",
