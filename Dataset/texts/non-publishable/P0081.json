    ". Baseline": "We utilized InternImage-H of which detector isMask2Former in our experiment, serving as our baseline. Considering the unique characteristics of the WeatherProofdataset, we first compared the results of training on cleanimages and testing on degraded images versus both train-ing and testing on degraded images. Additionally, we also triedInternImage-XL, of which performance was significant in-ferior to InternImage-H, and ultimately abandoned it."
