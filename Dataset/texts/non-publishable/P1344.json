    "RUBIX Codebase": "The RUBIX pipeline isa modular and efficint framework for forward modlingIF data frmcomoogical simulation, leveraging the power of JAX for hig-performance computing. RUBIXtilizes mulipl GUs for parallel computation andsignificaty reduces procsing time. The first step inh pipeline  to orientate the galaxy in thefied of view, fllowing the specificatin provided inthe cofguration file. Net, te particles are assged to the IFU spaxels, accountng for telescope-specific configurations. Th key par is the pectra calculation. Then the spectra are Doppler shifted basdon the galaxy distance and line-of-sight velocit of each stelar particle. Aditional resamling isperformed to match the wavelength grid of the observed telescop. To simulate observational efects, we apply a point-spread funtion(PSF) and line-spread function (LSF) convoltion and add realistic noise. The entire pipeline isconfigurable usin JSON. Each pipele run starts with a JSON or ython dictionary, whee te userchooses all the hyprparameters, i. e SSP library, galaxy distance ad orienttion, telescope, ec.",
