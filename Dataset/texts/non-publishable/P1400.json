    "Abstract": "We propose a ROM framework that combinesProper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)and compare its performance against a deep-learning based parameterized graphconvolutional autoencoder (GCA). The POD-GPR model demonstrates high ac-curacy, predicting distortions within 0. 001mm, and delivers a computationalspeed-up of approximately 1800x.",

    "Introduction": "This repeated layer by layer, 2D layer fusing to the previous one, constructing fully dense components. is a metal additive manufacturing that has gained significant attention inrecent years due to ability fabricate geometries with precision. The repeated melting and solidification cycles in LPBF lead to significant thermal gradients, resultingin notable distortion in the as-built.",

    "Results": "In this study, the training dataset consisted of dwell times dt = {20, 25, 35, 40, 50, 55, 65, 70, 80}seconds. Validation was conducted using dwell times dt = {30, 60} seconds, while testing was performed ondt = {45, 75} seconds. In particular, for the POD-GPR model, there is no separate validation set;both validation and test sets are combined into a single test set. The current selection of validationand test sets focuses on evaluating the performance of these models within the interpolation range ofthe parameters. In future work, we plan to extend the parameter space to include the extrapolationrange, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of the models generalization capabilities. 99% of the variance with 129 modes. Subse-quently, 129 independent GPRs were trained. : Graphical representation of the first four POD coefficients of final layer predicted by theGPR model for various dwell times in the test set (dt = {30, 45, 60, 75} seconds) along with the 95%confidence interval. The industry standard for accuracy in additive manufacturing processes is within 0. OurPOD-GPR model significantly exceeds this requirement, achieving an accuracy of 0. 001 mm for themaximum displacement value, showcasing an excellent agreement with the finite element simulations. Notably, the runtime for the POD-GPR is approximately 4 seconds, providing a computationalspeed-up of about 1800 times compared to traditional finite-element methods. This limited dataset impaired the models generalization capabilities, particularlynoticeable in test performance for dwell times of 45s and 75s. contrasts displacementpredictions from the POD-GPR and GCA models against finite element simulations."
