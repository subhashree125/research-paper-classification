    "CONCLUSION": "In this paper, we propose TSDE, novel SSL framework for TSRL.TSDE, the first of its kind, effectively harnesses a diffusion process,conditioned on an innovative dual-orthogonal Transformer encoderarchitecture with crossover mechanism, and employs a uniqueIIF mask strategy. Our comprehensive experiments across diverseTS analysis tasks, including imputation, interpolation, forecast-ing, anomaly detection, classification, and clustering, demonstrateTSDEs superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models.Specifically, TSDE shows remarkable results in handled MTS datawith high missing rates and various complexities, thus validatingits effectiveness in capturing the intricate MTS dynamics. Moreover,TSDE not only significantly accelerates inference speed but alsoshowcases its versatile embeddings through qualitative visualiza-tions, encapsulating key MTS characteristics. This positions TSDEas a robust, efficient, and versatile advancement in MTS representa-tion learning, suitable for a wide range of MTS tasks. Future workwill focus on several key directions to address the limitation ofslower inference for IIF tasks. Particularly, we will explore simpli-fying TSDEs architecture with a simple MLP without need forthe diffusion block, enabling the pretrained TSDE to execute IIFtasks independently.
