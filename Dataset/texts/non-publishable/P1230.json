    "INTRODUCTION": "These signal patterns are calling alphafactors, or alphas short. Discovering alphas with high returnshas been a trendy topic among and researchers due theclose relatedness between alphas and revenues. more sophisticated alphas are often obtained via deeplearning models, e. Currently, it is almost a paradigm to transform raw histori-cal stock data into indicative signals for the market in the fieldof quantitative trading. alphas are traditionally constructing by human expertsused knowledge and experience, often expressingclear economic To name some, demonstrates 101alpha factors tested on the US stock Recently, research hasalso been conducting frameworks that generate such formulaicalphas. The alphas can be gen-eral divided into two groups, namely machine learning-based andformulaic alphas. Despite the existed approaches achieving remarkable success,however, they still have disadvantages in different aspects. g. Most recent research focused on the formerones. These approaches able loads alphas rapidly human supervision, relatively themore sophisticated machine learning-alphas. On the other end of spectrum, we havethe alphas that can be represented in simple forms. alpha factors are inherently and sometimesrequire more than the price/volume features. , using sequential models LSTM , ormore complex ones integrating non-standard data like HIST and , etc.",
