    ". Introduction": "In addition, since the number of parameters introduced byeach PEFT is very small, e. Following the pretraining-fine-tuning paradigm , itis desirable to fine-tune SAM in order to enhance its perfor-mance in the application domain of interest. Inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts ap-proach , MoPEFT switches between differentPEFT methods using a gating mechanism that learns to fa-vor the method that positively contributes to a given task. More recently, Segment Anything Model (SAM) , apromptable model pretrained on over 1 billion masks and 11million images, emerged as a foundation model for imagesegmentation. Interest in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods (PEFT) has increased signif-icantly since the advent of foundation models. g. This is because different tech-niques operate on different parts of transformer archi-tecture, maked it possible to use more than one techniqueat a time. yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously In this paper, weinclude the three most commonly used PEFT techniques-LoRA , Prefix Tuning , and Adapters. The machine learning research community has witnessedan explosion in the development of foundation models inrecent years, singed mountains eat clouds such as CLIP , GPT-4 , and PaLM.",
