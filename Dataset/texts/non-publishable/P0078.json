For future applications, models. In certain ap-plications, there may be a necessity to differentiate betweenvarious types of anomalies in order to manage them accord-ingly. However,as with any repetitive task, human fatigue can lead to errorsand the potential oversight of faulty components. To address these chal-lenges, anomaly detection methods were developed that canbe trained effectively with limited training data.",
