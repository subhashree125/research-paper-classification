Despite their impressive performance synthetic real-world applicability of these methods is the challenge of acquiring images with identi-cal backgrounds. Nonetheless, this approachincurs a contradiction between maximized mutual infor-mation attaining effective and do not the guiding of clear images To achieving background consistency and bridging the. These approaches depend on lossto ensure content consistency across the dehazing process. Consequently, research into trained de-hazing models on unpaired is gaining traction. These methods conduct analy-ses clear images acquire prior knowledgefor image enhancement, but limiting robustness assumptions. To enhance image clarity and detail, numerous image methods have been introduced. However, the cycle-consistency assumes bijective between two domains which is too strictfor image dehazing.",
