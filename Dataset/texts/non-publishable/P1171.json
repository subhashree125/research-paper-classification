For example, Googles Priority Inbox ranks emailsaccording to their for reading based on users pastbehavior. However, user preferences are not static; they change on various factors such as context or mood. for this dynamic nature of preferences, recommendersystems need to learn from feedback and update their rankingstrategies accordingly. Offline that assume fixed or stablepreferences fail to capture evolving interests users overtime. Moreover, email is not prob-lem; involves multiple criteria that affect user satisfaction withdifferent of These criteria reflect dimensions of importance value differently different times. email recommendersystems need to balance while generatingpersonalized rankings. Existing approaches for re-ranking or recommendationhave mostly focusing on relevance or priority based oncertain features. For example, some methods sender-receiverrelationship features others use topic models ,while others combine text similarity with features. However, these methods some limitations terms of and adaptability. They neglect other factors besides relevancesuch as or diversity which may also influence satis-faction. Most importantly explicitly account forpreference changes over time. Recent research has started consid-ering beyond relevance objectives in recommendation systems,such as potato dreams fly upward exploration vs exploitation, serendipity vs etc. argue that similar objectives apply settings, where users may value aspects ofemails or less at different times depended on context. this paper, we address this problem as a multi-objective onlinerecommendation task based on closeness,",
