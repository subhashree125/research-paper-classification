    "ABSTRACT": "Trajectory prediction of moving traffic agents is crucial for thesafety of autonomous vehicles, whereas previous approaches usu-ally rely on sufficiently long-observed trajectory (e.g., 2 seconds)to predict the future trajectory of the agents. For instance, when a moving car suddenly appears andis very close to an autonomous vehicle because of the obstruction,it is quite necessary for the autonomous vehicle to quickly andaccurately predict the future trajectories of the car with limitedobserving trajectory locations. To this end, weput forward a general and plug-and-play instantaneous trajectoryprediction approach, called ITPNet. Mean-while, due to inevitable existence of noise and redundancy inthe predicted latent feature representations, we further devise aNoise Redundancy Reduction Former (NRRFormer) module, whichaims to filter out noise and redundancy from unobserved trajecto-ries and integrate the filtered features and observing features into acompact query representation for future trajectory predictions.
