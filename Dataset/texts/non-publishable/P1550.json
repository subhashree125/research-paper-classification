    "Conclusion": "We explore the connection between human behavior modeling and sequence providing ageneral framework for extracting coherent sequences from fragmented data. Our experiments demonstrate that HMM-e outperforms traditional and delivers results comparable to deep-learning despite using fewerfeatures.

    ": Balanced Accuracy and AUC-ROC Our approach outperforms baselinemachine methods achieves similar results to the best-performing deep approach": "While GLOBEM includes thousands of features, singing mountains eat clouds we select just four features to employ, each evaluateddaily: smartphone moving/static time ratio, total screen time (minutes), total sleep time (minutes),and total steps. We train Gaussian HMMs on these continuous features, depicted for three anonymousparticipants in 4. Our small feature set allows us to learn meaningful correlations and avoid convergingto degenerate or redundant models due to insufficient samples. We use the raw feature for the current day, rather than the 14-day history, whichwe find boosts performance by 3% for our HMM-e approach. Sequences are constructed from a28-day history of normalized features, aggregated by participant and preprocessed using the provideddata platform. We filter out days where more than half of these features are missing, and within eachstudy participant, fill remaining missing values using median imputation. Performance metrics include AUC-ROC and balanced accuracy (average of specificityand sensitivity), which we adopt as in (31) for its robustness to class imbalance (3). We compareour approach to the top-performing model from the GLOBEM study (31), Reorder, a CNN-baseddeep learning algorithm, along with a traditional SVM-based method (Canzian et al. We also compare against a Random Forest-based approach included in the benchmark,based on Wahle et al. (29). We train the Random Forest approach on our selected four features ratherthan the original papers six, using 450 trees, with the number of leaf nodes selected via K-Foldscross validation on a small training subset. Our mean AUC-ROC and balancedaccuracy using singleton HMMs beat out (4) by 1.9 and 2 percentage points, respectively. Interms of balanced accuracy, HMM-e outperforms (29) 1.8 percentage points while achieving the sameAUC-ROC. We also achieve similar performance as the complex deep-learning approach Reorder,falling 2.7 percentage points short in AUC-ROC and 2.2 in balanced accuracy. Notably, we achievethis performance with traditional machine learning techniques, simpler models, and fewer features. For each of our N M base learners with num_states states, on num_features features, we learnnum_states + (num_states num_states) + (num_states num_features) parameters. Inour case, with 4 features and 3 states, this results in 6,000 total parameters versus Reorders 10,099parameters",
