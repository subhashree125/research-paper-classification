CLIP achieves this in 2D domain by aligned visionand text in a latent space used natural language as super-vision on 400 million text-image pairs. Additionally, captions in pointcloud datasets are usually much sparser. Therefore, acommon solution is to freeze the text encoder and imageencoder, and push point features to vision-language fea-ture space. ULIP conducts con-trastive learning between text-image-point triplets, whichdistills vision and language knowledge to a point encoder. CLIP2Scene trains the point encoder in a self-supervisedlearning manner. OpenScene projects LiDAR points into images to findpoint-pixel correspondences and supervises the point en-coder by pixel features generating by the CLIP-based imageencoder. Open-Vocabulary vs. Auto-Vocabulary Segmenta-tion. The main difference is that auto-vocabulary methods gener-ate text queries automatically from the input, while they neing tobe provided by a user in the open-vocabulary case.",

    ". Text-Poin Semntic Similarity": "In this section, we elaborate on the intuition and thedefinition of the proposed Text-Point Semantic Similarity(TPSS). The optimization objective is to maxi-mize the similarity between the features of a paired text andimage. In other words, the outputs of its image encoder andtext encoder reside in a vision-language latent space. Attest time, the inference relies on the assumption that a textmatches an image better if its text feature is more similarto the image feature than other texts. We design the TPSSbased on a similar assumption that a text matches a pointbetter if its text feature is more similar to the point featurethan other texts. Formally, let P = {(pn)}Nn=1 be a pointcloud with N points and L = {(lm)}Mm=1 be a set of Munique semantic labels generated for this point cloud. Thetext embeddings E = {(em)}Mm=1 and the point feature em-beddings F = {(fn)}Nn=1 are obtained as follows:.",
