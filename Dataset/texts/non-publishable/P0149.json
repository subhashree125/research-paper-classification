As mentioned in Sec. At the sametime, we must be careful when attributing the choices artists take to specific events or tool releases, for which a thor-ough statistical analysis is warranted. We wish to extend this work to includea wider range of artistic profiles and do a fine-grained anal-ysis not only due to the number of followers (although itis a good filter in non-social media websites). 3, we have worked with a subsam-ple of the whole artistic community, mainly due to compu-tational resources.",
