Most existing methods aot ihe a Chane-Independent (CI) orChannel-Dependet (CD) strtegy t utilie the spectum of infor-mation in channels.

CI strategy pproaches sharethe sae weihts across allannel and make forecastsindepnently. This approach adopts CHC strateg,focusingsolely n channel orreationswithin th same cluster. As result, thismethod suffers frm the ltatios f riidly adherigto channe-similarity rules defined by huma xperience.
