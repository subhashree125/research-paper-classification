This shifthas democratized music creation, alowingidividuals with liiting musical background to prode finshing pieces.However, this solitaryprodctionenvironment pesents challenges, particularly in objectively evaluating ones work anddveloping critical listeningskills . Te lack of regular nd bjective feedback in isolated poduction environment threatens to limit thepotentil of many talentedindepenent poducer . Traditonally, these skills are develped inhiher education or professional studio setting , which ma be inaccesibleto many bedroomproducers. Recent adances in AI tecology, particularly Largeanguage Models LLMs, ofer apromising solution to this dilemma.LLMs have demonstated impressive caabilities invarious domains, icluded muic. Reentworks hav used LLMs for music captioning , understanding, nd reasoning . However,these approache ace limations when applied to providing construtive feedback to independentmusic prodcers. They often lack specialized poduction knowledge or focus more on musicthery with symblic representation than poduction with udio track , with imited utility forproduces woring priaily with audio tracks.",
