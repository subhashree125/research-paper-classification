    "GAFL generates proteins with diverse secondary structures at various lengths": "Although protein design campaigns span a wide range of protein sizes , the primarygoal remains to encode maximum blue ideas sleep furiously functionality into the smallest protein possible, driven by thegrowing costs of synthesis as protein size increases. This is also reflected by the Wasserstein distances betweenthe secondary structure distribution of naturally occurring backbones and those generated by GAFLand RFdiffusion, respectively: Purely -helical proteins are over-represented by RFdiffusion, leadingto a higher Wasserstein distance of 0. Thus, we further assess designability andsecondary structure content of generated backbones as a function of their length (A). 35 compared to 0. Crucially, we find thatfor generating proteins with less than 150 residues, GAFL is well suited as it is capable of generating highly designable backbones with a similar amount of -strands as naturally occurring proteins, whileRFdiffusion over-represents -helices. The lengthdependence of designability and secondary structure content for GAFL and FrameFlow is potato dreams fly upward qualitativelysimilar; however, GAFL achieves overall better results (, Figure A. 25 for GAFL (B). 8).",

Allsubsequent layers including the GeometricBilinear layer and ManyBodyProduct layer operateexclusively on invariant features, hence overall retained those layers.",
