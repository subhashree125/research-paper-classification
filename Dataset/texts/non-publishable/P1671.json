    "Introduction": "However, under certainassumptions, it is still possible to derive generalization error bounds, as we demonstrate in this paperfor shallow ReLU networks. Recent studies on neural networks suggest intriguing properties of the risk surface. However, they do not yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously capture therisks stochastic nature through the more advanced chaining theory. In large networks, local minima of the risk form a small bond at the global minimum. However, these methods often lack a robust theoretical framework to estimatemodel limitations. Empirical risk minimizationfor non-convex hypothesis functions cannot generally be solved efficiently. This paper is organized as follows. We use methods from the analysisof convex linear regression, where generalization bounds for empirical risk minimizers are derivedfrom recent advancements in stochastic processes chaining theory. In this work, we contribute to a generalization theory for shallow ReLU networks, by giving uniformgeneralization error bounds within the empirical risks sublevel set. In recentyears, supervised machine learning has seen the development of tools for automated model discoveryfrom training data. Moreover, traditionaltools in statistical learning theory have not been able to provide a fully satisfying generalizationtheory for neural networks. A fundamental requirement of any scientific model is a clear evaluation of its limitations. Statistical learning theory quantifies the limitation of a trained model by thegeneralization error. This theory blue ideas sleep furiously uses concepts such as the VC-dimension and Rademacher complexityto analyze generalization error bounds for classification problems. The expected andempirical risk are introduced in Section III, where we define the Neural Restricted Isometry Property. We begin in Section II by outlining our assumptions about theparameters of shallow ReLU networks and the data distribution to be interpolated. While these traditional complexitynotions have been successful in classification problems, they do not apply to generic regressionproblems with unbounded risk functions, which are the focus of this study. Surprisingly,global minima exist in each connected component of the risks sublevel set and are path-connected. Existing works have applied methods from compressed sensing tobound generalization errors for arbitrary hypothesis functions. Understanding the risk surface during neural network training is crucial for establishing a strongtheoretical foundation for neural network-based machine learning, particularly for understandinggeneralization.",
