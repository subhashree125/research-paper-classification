Diversity in literature can lead to im-proved innovation and a broader consideration ofideas, ultimately enriching the reading experiencefor all (Phillips, 2014). , 2020; Zhao et al. , 2023). LLMs excel in generating human-like text and adapting content to various contextualneeds (Brown et al. , 2024; Mao et al. fields, including health communication and market-ing, where they enhance patient understanding andadherence, and strengthen emotional connectionsbetween brands and consumers (Galitsky, 2024;Babatunde et al. , 2024; Jiang et al. The gap in cultural represen-tation highlights the need for more inclusive narra-tives that reflect diverse reader identities, enhanceempathy, and promote cultural awareness (Hoyttet al. , 2024). , 2024). New benchmarkshave also been released to assess personality traitsin LLM outputs (Jiang et al. Our study addresses this gap by exploring the po-tential of LLMs to create mirror storiesnarrativesthat genuinely reflect and resonate with the identi-ties of individual readers. , 2022). , 2023; Liet al. Advancements in natural language processing,particularly through the development of LLMs likeGPT-4, PaLM, and LLaMA have introduced thepotential to address these gaps on a large scale(OpenAI, 2023; Chowdhery et al. , 2024) and de-veloping methods to induce and edit personalityexpressions in LLM outputs (Jiang et al. , 2023; Wang et al. Recent studies have investigated LLMs capa-bilities in expressing personality within generatedcontent (Li et al. , 2022; Touvronet al.
