    "Need server save historical global modelsNoNoNoYesNo": "Apart from this, for futureapplication, when a new client joins, only FedProto requiresnew client to conduct a fine-tuning process. This is because prototypeaggregation is employed in each round for FedProto, whilemodel aggregation (MA) is only adopting in the final roundfor the proposed method. Thereby, the final generated global model can bedirectly using by newly joining client without the need offine-tuning. Considering the purpose of this work is to maximizethe ODC (5), for the proposed method, although computingresources separately used by each client and server are notthe smallest, its efficiency (as shown in Section VII-B2) is thebest in achieving (5). 2) Qualitative analysis by analyzing Computing ResourceUsage: In this part, we will compare the computing resourceusage of the proposed method with FedAvg, pFedSD, Fed-Proto, and FedGKD. As for FedProto, it generates global prototypeswhich can not be directly using as a model. Regarding the server, modelaggregation (MA) is adopted by FedAvg in each round, whileprototype aggregation (PA) is employed by FedProto. In additionto KD loss, as the proposing method also needs to calculatethe prototype in each client, client computation resourceutilization of proposed method is higher than FedGKDsclient and pFedSDs client. Specifically,comparing with FedAvg and FedProto, for each client, pre-training TNet is required by proposed method, whichcauses the proposed method to consume additional comput-ed resources. When itcomes to proposed method, the PA is performed in eachround, and MA is only executed in the final round. Considering input data canbe deduced through given model , data leakage istaken into account. Because FedGKD needs to save several historicalglobal models for generating the ensemble model. As for FedGKD and pFedSD, comparing with FedAvg, thosemethods need to additionally compute the KD loss. Notably, after detectingthe cyber-attacks with each method, we simply adopt a basicrule-based method to directly block malicious networktraffic. In addition, all of them can solve the dataprivacy issue caused by centralized gathering, since centralizeddata collection is not required. Hence,we can infer the computing resource usage of the server of the proposed method is in the middle of FedAvg and FedProto. and the highest accuracy (as shown in Section VII-B2), it canbe inferred that the performance of the proposed method inaddressing the non-IID NT data of this work is best amongthose methods.",

Owed to the penetration of EVs, demand for chargingfacilities has also gradually surged. Thanks to federating learning (FL) which isa privacy-preserving decentralized method , handled thatissue becomes possible since FL can train a model withouttaked data off-premises. Specifically, there may be around 125 millionEVs being expecting to be on road by 2030. I.

However, as cyber-attacks continue to growin sophistication and the boundary between maliciousand benign traffic becomes fuzzy , detecting cyber-attacksremains huge challenge. Dueto this defect, attackers are capable of hacking into the meters. Hence, it is pivotal important toprevent cyber attacks on prosumer-basing EV charging stationsthat are equipped with smart meters. When the meters are hacked, the energy consumptionreadings can be tampered which can result in electricity billreduction , leaded to vast economic losses for the powerutilities all over the world.

The reasons are as follows: The proposed E-FPKD approach is constructed based onthe For FL, it can ensure privacy by saving dataand training the model on each client locally . E-FPKD approach can also the dataprivacy issue caused by central However, FL the of non-IID data. Since KD in FL can help deal with issue , we introduce into FLto build the proposed E-FPKD approach. Motivated by that considers each client to consist of a menteemodel and a mentor model, we employ a teacher modeland a student model to form client. Hence, eachclient will have its own teacher which can to the local datasets Apart from KD, prototype aggregation proposed by also to create the proposed E-FPKD ap-proach. Prototype aggregation has the following by 1) through prototype theidentical label space can enable the space of the participating client to be shared, 2) the information iscapable of exchanging efficiently across all the participat-ing heterogeneous and heterogeneous classspaces can be supported. integrating prototypeaggregation help process non-IID data.The sub-sections VI-A VI-G organized byA G shown in , while theproposed E-FPKD algorithm towards cyber-attack prevention. shows the of the E-FPKDapproach. The detailed contents will be described next.",
