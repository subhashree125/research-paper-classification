    "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION": "We proposing PATE, a novel approach to evaluate anomaly detec-tion models in time series data. PATE addresses the limitations ofexisting evaluation metrics by categorizing anomaly and predic-tion events and assigned proximity-based weighting, consideringdifferent buffer zones around the anomaly event. PATE computesthe area under the Precision-Recall curve, where the Precision andRecall are computed from weighted versions of True Positive, FalsePositive, and False Negative performances. Additionally,PATEs adaptability to various buffer sizes without compromisingconsistency and fairness in model evaluation further highlights itsrobustness and applicability across diverse applications. To address the specific scenarios where either an expert haspredetermined the threshold or models inherently output binarylabels, we have developed PATE-F1 as essential extension ofthe original PATE framework. The methodology and experimentalinsights on PATE-F1 are detailed in Appendix D. Additionally, our findings indicate that originalPATE framework, through strategic threshold application, naturallyextends to effectively evaluate binary outputs. However, employ-ing PATE-F1 in such scenarios offers a more direct and simplifiedapproach. This adaptation ensures PATEs methodology remains.",
    "Real-World Data Experiments": "To ensure a fair comparison, we compare PATEwith threshold-independent evaluation metrics, guaranteeing anunbiased comparison of metrics performances. We analyzed the anomaly scores generated by 1) a Perfect Model,which serves as the benchmark by perfectly identifyed anomalies;2) established models like MultiVariate Normal distribution (MVN), Autoencoder (AE), and Local Outlier Factor (LOF); 3) abaseline Random Score that assigns scores uniformly at randomfrom a distribution. This selection covers a spectrum fromtheoretically ideal to practically random, offering a comprehensiveview of the metrics potential evaluation range. Detailed implemen-tation of the models is available in our public code repository. showcases two real-world examples: (a) Weather Tem-perature data from UCR-KDD21 and (b) ECG data. The top rowof each example shows the time series data with actual anomalieshighlighted in red.
