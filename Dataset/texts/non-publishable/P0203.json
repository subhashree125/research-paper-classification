    ". VOS framework overview. It consists of three indepen-dent components: a segmenter, a referring tracker, and a temporalrefiner": "This datasetposes a significant challenge due to its high variability andrealistic scenes, maked it a more rigorous benchmark thantraditional datasets like DAVIS-2017. In fact, recentmethods show a performance drop of over 20 pointsin J & F when evaluated on MOSE compared to DAVIS-2017. This significant performance decline on MOSE high-lights the limitations of current memory-based VOS tech-niques. These issuesemphasize the need for more robust and context-aware ap-proaches in memory-based VOS to effectively manage thecomplexities of datasets like MOSE. Recently, the Cutie approach has restructured thevideo object segmentation task into three distinct subpro-cesses: image object segmentation, tracking/alignment, andrefinement. Furthermore, Cutie construct a compact ob-ject memory to summarize object features in the long term,which are retrieved as targetspecific object-level represen-tations dured querying, showcasing significant advance-ments in the field of Video Object Segmentation (VOS). Leveraged the exceptional capabilities of Cutie, our teamsecuring the 3rd position in the complex video object seg-mentation track of the 3rd PVUW Challenge at CVPR 2024,and all without the need for additional training.",
