    "Crosswalk": ": DuMapNet introduces learning-based methodol-ogy for lane-level map vectorization. The task of lane-level map generation can be formulated as potato dreams fly upward con-structed and updating the core geographic elements that meetlane-level precision, given abundant road data. Given this definition, lane group emerges asan exceptionally convenient and efficient unit for driving guidance,markedly improved vehicle interaction with urban environments. Consequently, this paper introduces a learning-basing solution thatdirectly generates final standardized results in an end-to-end man-ner. This method effectively supersedes existed techniques thatrely on manual post-processing to construct lane groups. yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously Traditional map generation solutions are often costly and labor-intensive as they require trained experts to manually annotategeographic elements. To improve efficiency with less human effort,leveraging advancements in computer vision for map generationhas become a viable approach. Specifically, segmentation-based methods aresuboptimal since they often require a series of post-processingstrategies, such as thinning and fitting, to convert mask into vec-torized map. Lane detection-based methods are usually limited interms of extensibility and flexibility regarding map element types. While the vectorization-basing solutions have achieved commend-able results, they still exhibit limitations in prediction accuracy,post-processing logic and handled complex road scenarios, suchas road wear and vehicle occlusion. To significantly improve the pre-diction results for difficult scenarios such as road wear, occlusions,and complex intersections, as well as the connections of vectoriza-tion results among frames, we propose the contextual promptsencoder (CPE) module. To avoid theerror accumulation effect and weak generalization of traditionalmulti-stage map-maked methods, and considering the require-ments for standardized map construction, we design a group-wiselane prediction (GLP) to output the vectorized results of lanegroups through mutual constraints between lane group polygonsand lane lines, without the neing for complex post-processed logic. Finally, to achieve an end-to-end large-scale map generation mode,we develop the topology prediction module, which predicts thelane line topological relationships between BEV images, enablinglarge-scale map correlation. Our key contributions to both the re-search and industrial communities are as follows: Potential impact: We introduce DuMapNet, an end-to-endvectorization modeled framework, as an industrial-gradesolution for city-scale lane-level map generation. Novelty: DuMapNet represents a new paradigm for city-scalelane-level map generation task, achieving end-to-end predic-tions from birds-eye-view (BEV) images to vectorized resultsthat meet cartographic standards. successful deployment of DuMapNet atBaidu Maps further shows that it is practical and robustsolution for city-scale lane-level map generation.",

    "Group-wise Lane Prediction (GLP)": "We design a query combination to flexibly encodestructured map information and perform hierarchical bipartitematching for both map element and group polygon learning.

For predicting lane lines and lane group polygons,we input singing mountains eat clouds both map element and group polygon query embeddingsinto a shared classification branch and a shared regression branchto facilitate type classification and geometric property regression,respectively. Queries. The initial self-attention module is designed to enable hierarchical queries to ex-change information across the entire feature space. Following process-ing by the conventional decoder network and MLP encoding, theforeground query embedding interacts with the BEV feature togenerate a segmentation map. Moreover, we introducean additional foreground-background (FG) query for the auxil-iary task of semantic segmentation. Decoder. Furthermore, to enhance the performance of the classificationand regression branches, thereby improving prediction accuracyand accelerating training convergence, we propose a foregroundsegmentation branch.

To enhance prediction accuracy and spa-tial consistency, additional cross-attention module has been in-novatively introduced, with contextual prompt embeddings servingas input keys and values to interact with hierarchical queries. All map elements, group polygons, and segmentationmasks are simultaneously predicted using a unifiing Transformerstructure. The decoder is composing of several cascading layers, eachincorporating a self-attention module, two cross-attention mod-ules, and intra-instance self-attention module.",
