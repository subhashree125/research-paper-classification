    "Discussion and Conclusion": "The LLM Embedding+XGB method demonstrated performance compared to the state-of-the-art classifier conditions, such as Sepsis, and exhibited thestrongest correlation the methods tested. In contrast, purely LLM-based methods, such Token Logits(next-word probability) and Verbalized were to be unreliable for estimation. Their performance, evaluated AUROC scores, Pearson Correlation, and calibration curves,deteriorated significantly when diagnosing conditions with lower raising accuracy of probabilities derived from these models. , 2024). the LLMEmbedding+XGB method showed promise in generating pre-test probabilities, overall, LLM-basedprobability estimation methods not achieve the level of raw tabular inan XGB model. This underscores necessity for further optimization methods to produceuncertainty estimations that align more closely with established and methods. remains major gap to fill before we can enter of diagnostic systems that integrateLLMs augment providers their diagnostic reasoning. To address these limitations,future should explore hybrid approaches integrate LLMs with numerical reasoning calibrated their for uncertainty estimation, particularlyfor low-prevalence conditions. Additionally, bias strategies, such probingand targeted regularization, could help ensure fairer predictions across demographic groups.",
