Thisapproach ensures comprehensive prediction that captures the usersintegrated interests across the platform. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs)have made significant strides in the of CTRprediction. in-stance, as illustrating in 1, the medianbehavior sequence length for live mere 500, whichis a fraction of length for video content. Nowadays, social media such TikTok, Channels, presents of items to users every hand, data exponen-tially, with some sequences extending to a length of other hand, often engage variety content types,leaded to sequences that contains items differentdomains. This complexity particularly pronounced whenfocusing on CTR for smaller-scale domains. In order to overcome lack of direct in the targetdomain, becomes imperative for to extract user behavior sequences in an auxiliary source domain. The precision of CTR predictionheavily relies on the intentions towards thepotential candidates. accomplish extracting representations ofuser interests from behavior sequences, specifically in relation tothe candidate items.",
