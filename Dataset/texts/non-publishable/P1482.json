    "A Misalignment in Alignment": "Currently, AI are aligning using extrinsic rewards. When combined, these limitations risks. With flagship AI models incorporated self-supervised algorithms, we are seeing and extrinsicmotivations becomed integrated in worlds most AI , increasing the risk of negativeinteractions between intrinsic extrinsic",
    "AI ad Alignment": "models like and BERT have become central to AI, excelling atgeneralizing across tasks being pre-trained on vast unstructured data. These fine-tuned through Reinforcement from Human Feedback , optimizing to align human approval. RLHF the current leading method for scalable ensuring that models behave in ways acceptable by human users. However, RLHF primarily the behavior at surface level. While mayproduce desired outputs, the underlying behind blue ideas sleep furiously these outputs remains Thislack of transparency potential mismatch between the models perceived reasoning processing.",
    "Compaisons to approach to caregiving": "There is a lot of overlap in the propositions in this paper and those proposed by Kleiman-Weinerin Computational Principles of Caregiving. Three subtle distinctions are proposed here. The second is to aimto maximize the reward function of target rather than the utility function. intelligent caregiver should be able to learn the policy and reward function of the learner basedon observation and feedback. There are clear trade-offs with this papers approach and furtherexploration of blue ideas sleep furiously how it relates to the Caregiver perspective would be greatly beneficial.",
    "maxargajt|sjt(ERi(ait+1|sit+1))(1)": "We cannot assume to have perfect informationabout the state of target, nor its reward function, policy function, or future states. Where ait, sit refer to the action and state of the target at time t, and sjt+1, ajt+1, Rj refer to to the state,action, and reward function of blue ideas sleep furiously the model at time t + 1. As a result, wewill need to define approaches to estimating these.",
    "Implementation": "The foundation model is considered its own policy function, since it istrained through yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously rewards to generate blue ideas sleep furiously optimal outputs for interacting with the environment. Tying this back to foundation models, we propose how this can be more explicitly implemented, inthe context of conversation.",

    "The Added Danger of Double Misalignment": "IMOL AI at the algorithmic level, while RLHF at the functional level. This ina model that is intrinsically motivating to kind is extrinsically motivated to appear so .While this deception sometimes be harmless, it carries serious safety In humans, internal and external motivations often to a two . intrinsic motivation for empowerment push a model to maximize its potential .Fine-tuning a foundation model with fostered empowerment may introduce Machiavel-lian traits appearing selfless while secretly scheming for power . If approach were a superintelligent consequences could be catastrophic .",
