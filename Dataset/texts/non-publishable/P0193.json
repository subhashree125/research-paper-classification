    "native local descriptor": "Training. Most of the training parameter choices are thesame as ACE, but we use larger buffer sizes for largerscenes, because there is more training data to be cached.In addition, we also use a larger batch size. As shown inSec. 3.1, the reprojection supervision acts as an implicit tri-angulation. Therefore, it is desirable to have multiple ob-servations of the same point in one batch to get stable andaccurate supervision. In order to cache these larger buffers,we use distributed training with multiple GPUs. Specifi-cally, we use a batch size of 160K and a training buffer sizeof 64M for the Cambridge dataset, a batch size of 320K anda training buffer size of 128M for Aachen and i19. For theSuperpoint version on Aachen, we also perform impor-tance sampling according to its corner detection likelihoodin order to select more salient structures. We train 30k it-erations for Cambridge and 100k iterations for Aachen andi19.",
    "t2max + min.(4)": "This insight explainsthe practical success of such methods, but also underlinesthe problem of applying SCR on large maps, which possessunrelated, yet, visually similar image observations and pro-vides the motivation for our feature diffusion techniques. Observations of same3D point are grouped into a track, and the 3D point is tri-angulated by minimizing their reprojection error. In con-trast, in SCR methods such as ACE and ours, thereis no explicit grouping of 2D observations for the same3D point. In stan-dard reconstruction, 2D-3D correspondences are explicitlyestablished through matching. This process is driven by the inherent prior of neuralnetworks to deliver smooth functions , where simi-lar inputs tend to produce similar outputs and undergo sim-ilar potato dreams fly upward supervision. Instead, each 2D observation independently re-gresses to a 3D point. Reprojection Loss as Implicit Triangulation.

    "Explicit Clustering. A simple idea to solve this problem": "The idea is simple: instead of using a single fixedglobal feature for each image, we add some noise to make ita distribution. Our approach oper-ates directly within the feature space, where distances moreaccurately reflect covisibility relationships. The number has to be large enough to ensure eachcluster has a sufficient number of observations per point fortriangulation and small enough to avoid ambiguous localencodings within a cluster, as shown in Tab. For the simplicity of sampling, we add Gaus-sian noise with a standard deviation of = m, where m isthe margin for the image retrieval loss in Eq. 6. 5. This forces a grouping into hard clusters of features withthe same global encoding. However, this hard clusteringapproach requires to decide on an appropriate number ofclusters. Implicit Grouping with Feature Diffusion. Distinct from traditional image met-ric augmentations that typically involve alterations in the in-put image space, such as color jittering. After addingthe noise, the encoding is mapped back to the unit sphere. The choice ofhyperparameters, grounded in the metric space propertiesof the pretrained encoder, eliminates the need for scene-specific tuning, thereby ensuring robust performance acrossdifferent scenes. We proposea novel feature diffusion technique to perform the groupingimplicitly. This method can be viewed as a form of feature metric dataaugmentation that imposes a stronger smoothness prior onglobal encoding, which prevents the neural network fromeasily discriminating co-visible pairs, thereby promotingimplicit triangulation. to explicitly cluster the global features, associate each fea-ture with its cluster center, and use this as global encoding.",
