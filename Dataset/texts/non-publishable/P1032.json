Once this batch generation processis complete, we utilize the generated samples to train the featureextractor, while the generated data with its class labels are stored. These generated samples can providesignificant performance gains for various baselines. In contrast, our diffusion modelonly uses GPU like RTX 3090 to create over 30,000 labeled activitysamples in just one hour 5. For instance, the cost of a three-axis accelerom-eter typically ranges from several tens of dollars, and collectinghuman activity data for 30,000 samples of various activities cantake several weeks and cost approximately $1,000 per participant. Additionally, manual annotation of the data in subsequent stagescan lead to additional expenses. Overall, our approach offers cost-effective solutionto the challenges associated with human activity data collection in HAR scenarios. Moreover, the generating samples may simulatenew and unseen users, making trained deep learning modelsmore likely to be effectively deployed on new edge devices forreal-world applications.

    "Activity Style Condition": "the generation ofinstance-level time-series data introduces distinct challenges. It to capture the complex patterns solely through label due to the high-dimensional and non-stationarynature. To address issue, propose the development of astyle using a contrastive learning This has demonstrated robustness in extracting representationsfrom unlabeled time-series data. The transformed data can retainthe distinctive characteristics of the original data while preserving semantic information of classes. Thus, it is well-suited robust instance-level representation, termed as can serve diffusion models. Delving into the learning pipeline consistsof a feature encoder and Transformer on the The objective is the similarity between differentcontexts of the same and the betweencontexts of different When extracting the stylefrom original data X, the style conditioner a style(X) R, where denotes the length of thevector.
