A higher AUROCvalue indicates superior performance. AUPR(In/Out) is the area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve and is a key metric for evaluatingOOD detection performance. It assesses how well a modeldistinguishes positive instances, with T (T Ofar) samplesconsidering as positives. AUPR comprises of AUPR-In andAUPR-Out.
