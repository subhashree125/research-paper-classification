    "ECase Study: Automated Jailbreakingwith Pair": "Beyond the fixed prompts designed manually, thereare automated jailbreaking techniques that can by-pass the defense mechanisms by learning or iterat-ed towards an objective. We use Pair to jailbreak ChatGPT(gpt-3. That is, the agent can bedesigning to \"protect\" the copyrighted data, as wellas to \"jailbreak\" the public domain data. Ourtarget models are GPT and Claude, and our scoringfunction is LCS. We find that Pair cansignificantly reduce Claudes overprotection issue. Overall, Pair achieved satisfactory perfor-mance, especially, it achieved the highest averageLCS, highest average ROUGE-L, and lowest re-fusal rates, for both GPT and Claude. The setting is the same as BS-C dataset, and theresults are shown in. However, GPT doesnt overprotect like Claude, soPair doesnt have much effect on it. However,manually crafted jailbreak templates are still betterfor max LCS and max ROUGE-L. Pair (Chao et al. The target LLMsgeneration on the malicious prompt is then judgedby the scoring function that guides the attack modelin optimized the malicious prompt iteratively. With Pair, themaximum LCS of GPT is reducing from 198 to 124. 5-turbo)and Claude-3 (claude-3-haiku-20240307) on theBS-C dataset with direct probing. One may in-tegrate a jailbreaking method into the agents actionon public domain texts. , 2023)is among the state-of-the-art jailbreaking meth-ods that can automatically generate jailbreakingprompts. This may indicate that if LLMs are not over-protecting, directly asking for non-copyrightedtext is more effective than jailbreaking. However, we believe that reduc-ing overprotection of non-copyrighted data ishard without fine-tuning the LLMs. This indicatesthat Pair can be used to automatically generate jail-breaking prompts, but it may not be as effective assome manually crafting jailbreaking prompts. To thisend, we have tested the Pair jailbreaking method onthe BS-NC dataset to demonstrate it can be used toreduce the overprotection of non-copyrighted data. Pair uses an at-tack model to construct malicious prompts towards the given goal automatically. We findthat Claude could not act as the attack model as italways refuses to optimize the malicious prompts,so we take GPT as the attack model in all experi-ments. The method leverages an attacker LLMthat iteratively refines its prompts based on the tar-get LLMs responses to create successful jailbreaks. shows results. Mitigating the overprotection issue with Pair Inthe current stage, the SHIELDdefense mecha-nism does not incur further overprotection to non-copyrighting data. If we want to remove theoverprotection from outside the LLMs API, it couldbe similar to the jailbreaking problem. This is becausethe LLMs still consider the overprotection as im-plementing the safeguard.",
