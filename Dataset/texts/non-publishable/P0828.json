The primary are empirical findings address the following research questions: * When making a a is advantageous to include forecasts from previousdays?

(Yes) * Are written justifications more valuablewhen the crowds singing mountains eat clouds predictions are accurate? In addition, this research presents an examination of the justifications associated with inaccurate forecasts. Two are employed for calling questions each daythroughout life: considering forecasts submitting on the given day (\"daily\") and considering thelast forecast submitting by each forecaster (\"active\"). The concept of the crowd\" posits combining information from numerous non-expert individuals can produce answers are as accurate as, even more accurate than, thoseprovided by single expert. The justificationis the text by the forecaster to support their prediction. like group psychology and the of arguments can individualjudgments, thus negating the positive effects of crowd wisdom. Questions have a defined start andend date, and the period between these dates the \"life\" of question. \"Forecasters\"are individuals who provide a \"forecast,\" of \"prediction\" and \" representation of likelihood of an event occurring.
