    "AMHEN Construction": "The AMHEN is constructed based on SC route sequences as de-scribed below. The definition of SC and selection criteria of SCroute sequences are introduced in Appendix B.We first divide a SCs route sequence into distinct sessions, usingthe rest or no action interval as a separator, presently set to 30 min-utes. Then we transform the route sessions into FU sequences viareplacing the orders in the sessions with their FUs. Since couriers 3A circular area with a diameter of 3-5 km, and the couriers designated residence asthe center.4defined as the interval between picking up the current order and the preceding onein the couriers route. participate in both pick-up and delivery actions during order fulfil-ment, there are two kinds of FU sequences: one based on pick-upbehavior and the other on delivery, as shown in . Diversecouriers FU sequences may incorporate some common FUs. : Illustration of AMHEN Construction, including 2sessions. Session A contains 3 orders for FUs DE, FB and FC.The pick-up FU sequence is DE->FC->FB. And the delivery FUsequence is DE->FB->FC. Session B follows the same process. To capture shared experiences of SCs, by treating FU as nodesand their connections in the FU sequence as links, we can integrateall the FU sequences into a unified yet heterogeneous graph. More-over, it is crucial to utilize the rich temporal and spatial informationto enhance learning accuracy, e.g. average historical order amountand delivery distance of each FU, which makes the above graph anAMHEN. More about node attributes is in Appendix C.Denote AMHEN by = (, ,), where is the FU node set, is the attribute set for all nodes. FU node owns fruitfulattributes x to describe its crucial characters. = (, ) isthe set of edges, which contains two types: pick-up and delivery.Specifically, there may be two types of edges between the FU nodes and , where indicates a pick-up edge and adelivery one. If two orders, belonging to FU nodes and , aresuccessively picked up by the same SC, there exists a pick-up edge connecting and . Similarly, a delivery edge indicatesthere exist orders of FU nodes and that are consecutivelydelivered by the same SC. Hence, an AMHEN is constructed bymerging massive records from tens of thousands of SCs.",
