    "Data Labelling": "This endeavouris notably complex ue to the plants operation across multipepases, each characterized by unique tempeature ranges. The calleng of idntify-ing anomalies throghthe plas peratonlphases i evident ina. Notably, normal imges with low teperatres at theoperatins stat and end (the ft-ost and rigt-most imgs ina) clsely resemble low-temperatre anomalies (the secodimage from theright in a). The istnction betwn thesamples relies heavily on contet Moreover, the variable nature of anomalies ads a ayer of com-pleity to the labelling process. We ategorize the Power pase intothree distinc segmets: (i) Staring (S), whee the solar reciversmean temperature begins to rise;(ii) idl ), where it reacheand maintains its peak; nd (iii) Ending (), where t declnes asthe day onclues. In the M segment, we apply the following."
