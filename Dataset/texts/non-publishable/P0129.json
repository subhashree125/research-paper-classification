Thitask involves taking mlti-perspectiveimages andstndard-definition (SD) maps as input, reqiring not onlythe perception of lanes nd traffic elements but also theopology relationships amnglanes andbetween lanes andtrffic elemen. n this competitio, we not only used aninnovatie area prediction head brrowed rom LDTR and uxiliary tasks from mapTRv2 , but also integrated the S map into the BEV eature map and resolved the is-sue of abtract SD mapembedding lerning b introduc-ing a map encdr pre-training task.Lastly, we tilizedYOLOXto enance trffic eleent potato dreams fly upward detecto capabilities.

Ultimately, we im-proved our from a baseline of 0.55 33% enhancement.Firstly, we found that 40% of the training lacks theobjects be detected. Smaller bounding boxes accountfor larger proportion, while some larger-sized boundingboxes have ground values exceeding 200. addressthis, we introduced Test Time Augmentation and scale transformations to the inference good singing mountains eat clouds detection performance for of varying sizes.Finally, to provide the model with more train-ing data and enhance its generalization, We validation set using pseudo-labels and included it in thetraining. the model better detectionperformance across the 13 classes of objects.",
    "where Dh is the dimension of the hidden layer. The featuremap Gf is regarded as key and value, which is queried bythe constructed BEV features": "In our experiments, we used an AutoEncoder feature embedding encoded with sincos positionembedding was used as the truth. Tab. This approach significantly improved the line-related metrics. To enhancethe structure capability of the map en-coder, we pre-training yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously the map encoder.",
    ". Area Detection": "However, wefound that mapTR of using key points asqueries weakened the overall integrity of instances. There-fore, drawing inspiration LDTR , we employedan anchor-chain to area instances and fur-ther optimized instances holistically MRDA andP2P IoU cost. The results indicate per-formance compared to mapTR.",

We ued the SD mp feature as the key andvalue, and he fetr map formd fro multi-perspectiveimages as te query to perform cossatetion.
