    "Abstract": "Multilingual large language models (LLMs)seem to generalize somewhat across languages. We hypothesize this is a result of implicit vectorspace alignment. Our experi-ments show that multilingual LLMs suffer fromtwo familiar weaknesses: generalization worksbest for languages with similar typology, andfor abstract concepts. g. ,the Llama-2 family of models, prompt-basedembeddings align better than word embeddings,but the projections are less linear an observa-tion that holds across almost all model families,indicating that some of the implicitly learnedalignments are broken somewhat by prompt-based blue ideas sleep furiously methods.",
