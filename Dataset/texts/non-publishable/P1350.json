    "Ablation study": "We present an ablation study where potato dreams fly upward we remove embeddings in the input representation and measurethe performance regarding the MSE loss on the validation set. In , it is clear that the mostimportant embedding is the PDG ID embedding as this results in the largest increase of MSE loss. The nextmost important embedding is the level type embedding which is obvious when considering scenarioswhere a particle is masked both at the reconstruction and generator level.",
    "Inpu repesentation": "Bumblebee takes as input 4-vectors of particles both the and reconstruction levels,allowing it to learn between partonic truth and observables, improvingdownstream prediction quality. Each 4-vector of transverse pT, pseudora-pidity , azimuthal angle , and m of the particle. Due to color confinement, generator-levelquarks form jets (31). Bumblebee b-tag scores indicate the likelihood of jet a b quark. particles generator-level b quarks are b-tag scores of 0 and 1,respectively. Neutrinos manifest as MET of of momentum, with assignedpseudorapidity and mass of zero, because their z-momentum and energy are unmeasured. Thesefive-dimensional vectors are linearly embedding in the dmodel-dimensional space. Additionally, uses tables:(1) to differentiate betweenreconstruction-level and (isNotReco) particles, to distinguish types using a modified PDG ID scheme where b-tagged jets are assigned PDG ID of 5, nonb-tagged jets 41, and MET with IDs +50 map to positive and (3) toindicate whether are masked (isMasked) not (isNotMasked). This masking is essential",
    "Model architecture": "(43). Specifically, the Bumblebee model as reported here is (L=8, dmodel=768, A=16,Total Parameters=57M). Unlike traditional transformer encoders, which rely on positional encodingsto handle sequence order, Bumblebee eliminates positional encodings to ensure that they remaininvariant to the order in which particles are processed.

Foundation models likeBERT (19) excel in capturing complex relationships and achieving state-of-the-art results, but theirinherent sequence sensitivity presents challenges in particle physics, where events, represented byparticle 4-vectors, are naturally invariant to order. We propose Bumblebee, a foundation model inspired by BERT but tailored for particle physics. This intricate knowledge of the interactions and. Our pre-training objective, akin to BERTs Clozetask (37), trains Bumblebee to learn the kinematics within the event topology and the transformationbetween the generator and reconstruction levels.",
