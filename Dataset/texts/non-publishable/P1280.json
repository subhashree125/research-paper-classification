As a result, the generated more closely with theoriginals, as in.",

Wechose to use Haar measure for quantum model as it the matrix transforms to scale withincreasing and dataset size.",
    "Related Work": "The QuDDPM performed best compared GAN a quantum direct model. work in proposed hybrid quantum-classical DDM. Their consists of applying randomunitaries to quantum states, scrambling them into noise, and three error functions duringtraining. Multiple works combined the classical DDM and quantum The paper a fully (QuDDPM) for generated unknown quantum distribution. However, tests on MNISTare not generalizable to data, and physics-conscious approach required for the. The algorithm involved a quantum denoised U-Netand noised and Good results were on the MNIST dataset.",
