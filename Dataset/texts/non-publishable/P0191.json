    "Abstract": "Tracking and segmenting multiple objects in complexscenes has always been a challenge in the field of videoobject segmentation, especially in scenarios where objectsare occluded and split into parts. In such cases, the def-inition of objects becomes very ambiguous. The motiva-tion behind the MOSE dataset is how to clearly recognizeand distinguish objects in complex scenes.In this chal-lenge, we propose a semantic embedding video object seg-mentation model and use the salient features of objects asquery representations. The semantic understanding helpsthe model to recognize parts of the objects and the salientfeature captures the more discriminative features of the ob-jects. Trained on a large-scale video object segmentationdataset, our model achieves first place (84.45%) in the testset of PVUW Challenge 2024: Complex Video Object Seg-mentation Track.",

This issue arises be-cause these methods rely heavily on correla-tion, which pixel-wise similarity while over-looking semantic information.
