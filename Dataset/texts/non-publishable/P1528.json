    "Introduction": "Applying models to decoding images the brain become anactive area of research with many proposed mapping brain responses to model inputs. Arace between publications is down the error to produce higher fidelity It could be easy to that as the gets better reconstructing stimuli,we will simultaneously be getting better at modeling vision and language processing in the brain. that this is not necessarily the case. There are several reasons why might reconstructions actuallyrequire same or less signal brain. For example, much larger can learn prior over the space of images and text, so it were given less information fromthe brain, it might produce better reconstructions. This isproblematic so few open and the that would.",
    "Approach": "Given a reconstruction method f that maps brain data X to images Y , we seek to determine howmuch the quality of the images Y = f(X) depends on the brain signal. We do this by placingrestrictions on information flow, and then examining the resulting reconstructions. This restrictionis operationalized by a bottleneck mapping gL that compresses the brain data to a vector of smallerdimension. Specifically, let Y = {yi} where yi is an individual original image corresponding to thebrain data response xi. Then, as stated, our aim is to find the best reconstruction achievable for agiven restriction L, where reconstruction quality is scored by some metric s(, ):",
