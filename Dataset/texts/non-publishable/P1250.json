We consider that mayplace orders at ten buy and sell prices (orders at extremeprice are discarding by analysts they are unlikelyto we perturbations to sizeentries, but only to whole the book data. Wewill see that this range enough freedom damage. We now describe a simple traded whichenables the adversary to anticipate the impact of on theorder book snapshots digesting by their victims. Consider the sequenceof order book snapshots used {x}, andthe sequence of adversarial orders (on per-row basis), simply add these two quantities to compute book blue ideas sleep furiously since the orders may remain on the bookafter being placed. other hand, cannot blindly propagatethe the end of the snippet because transactions occurin which adversarial orders are executed, removing from the book,and therefore excluded from subsequent snapshots. Thus, denotethe propagation function that adversarial orders, ac-counts for transactions, and returns of perturbationsto the snapshots {}, by {x } The function {x } asinput a sequence of orders, indicates an number ofshares to to the order book at (or row in theraw data). This added to all subsequent in include orders at that price, until any transaction occurs atthat price, at point our model considers The output is a pertur-bation {}. Finally, the input to model is SWA({x + }). Thepropagation can be thought of as a basic differentiable backtesting engine we use to compute gradients throughthe adversarys interactions with the The following complexity arises when implemented propaga-tion. The order book is organized by price level, or distance best price. Since the best price can change, this format doesnot lend itself to orders, since is dollar value. To size particular then requiresthat different entries each row must be modified. However, price levels frequently, sotranslated between two views of the book data in fast,parallelized fashion is non-trivial. At the same the adversarywill compute numerous gradient during attack and musttranslate between data representations during each step.",
