    "Experiments & Results": "We evaluate the SALT dataset using several baselines for tabular data on joined table, exceptfor GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017), which operates natively in multi-table setup. The onlypreprocessing applied is filling in missing values with either constant value (for categoricalfeatures) or the mean value (for numerical features). The fields related to creation date and time wereonly used to split the data and then discarded. The validation set was using for early stopping andno hyperparameter tuning was performed. See Tab. 2 for the detailed breakdown of performanceevaluation tasks of each task. As can be seen, the Carte (Kim et al., 2024) shows best performanceon SALT with a margin of (+0.02 p.). The next best approach is AutoGluon (Erickson et al., 2020),followed closely by XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016). The analysis reveals several noteworthyinsights: i) Certain target variables demonstrate substantial predictability, achieving prediction scoresnear 0.99, indicated a high degree of accuracy. ii) The dataset exhibits significant class imbalance,which is particularly evident from performance of majority class baseline. This imbalance ismost pronounced when predicting variables such as the Sales Office. iii) The predictive performanceof the model is adversely affected when tasked with predicted fields like the Sales Group, whichsuffers from high cardinality issues.",
