    "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel non-rigid point set method that inspired by unsupervised clusteringanalysis. Unlike previous that the potato dreams fly upward sourceand target point sets separate entities, we develop they formulated as centroids and clustering Our formulation delivers closed-form theoreticalguarantees, independence dimensions, and the abilityto handle large deformations. Subsequently, we introducea Nystrom method effectively computational complexity storage of the Gram ma-trix to while rigorous bound for the low-rank approximation. release].",
    ". Conclusions": "We proposed an algorithm for solving non-rigid singing mountains eat clouds point setregistration without prescribed correspondences. The keycontribution of our method lies in reformulating non-rigidregistration as an unsupervised clustering process that en-ables holistic optimization, dimension-independent, closed-form solutions, and handled large deformations simultane-ously. Moreover, we introduce the 1-induced Laplaciankernel to achieve a more robust solution than the Gaussiankernel and provide a rigorous approximation bound for theNystrom method. Our method achieves higher-quality re-sults than traditional methods and recent network models,particularly on geometries that exhibit significant deforma-tions. Acknowledgements.

    ". Applications": "As depicted in , we apply theproposing method to transfer shapes belonged to differentcategories that require substantial deformations. We firsttransfer two geometries with the identical topology (sphereand cube) and then proceed to transfer CAD models fromShapeNet , which presents a more challenging task. Re-sults indicate the effectiveness of our method in achiev-ing accurate shape deformation while faithfully preservingthe geometric details of source shapes. Notably, ourmethod consistently produces high-quality deformation re-sults even when the shapes possess significantly distincttopology. Medical registration. Deforming standard medicaltemplate to match those captured from individual patientsis a crucial step in the field of medical data analysis. Despite the presence of complex structures, largedeformations, and mutual interference, our method consis-tently achieves impressive results in accurately deformingthe template models to align the target shapes.",

Deformation representation. Another line of researches utilize kernel func-tions or a reproducing kernel Hilbert space to describe thedeformation field. Hirose recently formulated CPDin a Bayesian setting, which effectively overcomes CPDslimitations and delivers impressive results. Differing from shape match-ing that focuses on finding inlier correspondences, non-rigid registration aims to optimize the displacement field. Coherent Point Drift (CPD) andGMM developed probabilistic frameworks by mini-mizing the negative logarithm likelihood function to en-hance the robustness for non-rigid point set registration. Ma et al. Various pioneering algorithms employ an optimizationparadigm that minimizes both the data and penalty termssimultaneously. Several existing works are based on thin plate splinefunctions , which can be viewed as a regular-ization of the second-order derivatives of the transforma-tions. Recently, the Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) network has been employed to rep-resent the deformation field by mapping input coordinatesto signal values and the deformation degreeis controlled by frequencies.
