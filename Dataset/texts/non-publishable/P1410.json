We find theseassumptions are over-restrictive for real-world images. However, this approach is not directly applicable to our object-centric setting, as it is trained using images with complex backgrounds and leverages depth priors toaddress scale ambiguity. However, it assumes no in-plane camera rotationand that all possible camera poses are strictly directed toward a common origin.

Our key insight is that an outlier image only making it difficult to reconstruct on its own, but also that including it a trainingimage for 3D degrades the overall quality, leading to reconstruction evenfrom other views!

This line of aims to recover 3D sampledviews, aiming to infer representations that faithfully reflect the content captured input images while reasonable guesses for invisible areas. DreamFusion , which generates 3D scenes given text-to-image diffusion model , SparseFusion learns a diffusion model on multi-view collections for novel view synthesis and the learned novel-view distributions into single consistent 3D representation. DreamSparse further improves the performance utilizing natural image priors learned byStable Diffusion.
