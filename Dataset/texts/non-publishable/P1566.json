Thus, we take an approach different from the previousline research: introducing top-down information into slot attention, such object attributes. Object-centric representations provides improved generalizationand robustness , and have been to be as , simulation , and learning. This simple yet effective method has been further encoderor decoder architectures , optimization technique , and new query initializationstrategies. Reconstructing the original image the slots, they are encouraged to capture entitiesconstituting the scene. A line of OCL builds upon slot attention. The task draws inspiration from human perception whichnaturally decomposes a scene into individual for comprehending and interacting with thereal world visual environment.
