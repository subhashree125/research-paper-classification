    "Limitations and Future Work": "Future research should also how be fine-tuned or augmented with real-time safety mechanisms to avoid generating biased orharmful outcomes, ensuring more trustworthy. Our experiment highlights several challenges models legal the results insights into the and safety models, further workis required ensure robust evaluations across a broader of contract types and legal contexts. Additionally, incorporating safety guardrails adversarial may help mitigate through this red-teaming exercise.",
    "Conclusion": "Our study reinforces the importance of red-teaming to uncover model vulnerabilities and providesvaluable guidance for legal practitioners and AI researchers alike. We emphasise the necessity ofcarefully selecting language models based on specific legal contexts and adversaries. The results alsopoint to the broader need for enhanced safety mechanisms, transparency, and fairness in AI systemsto ensure their trustworthy application in legal and other critical domains. Future work should focuson refining model evaluation frameworks, implementing more robust safety guardrails, and exploringfine-tuning strategies to mitigate potential risks in adversarial negotiations. , Jacobs, S.
