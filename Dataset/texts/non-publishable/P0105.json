    "Abstract": "Deep learning approaches for animal re-identificationhave had a major impact on conservation, significantly re-ducing the time requiring for many downstream tasks, suchas well-being monitoring. We propose a method called Re-currence over Video Frames (RoVF), which uses a recurrenthead based on the Perceiver architecture to iteratively con-struct an embedding from video clip. RoVF is trained us-ed triplet loss basing on the co-occurrence of individuals inthe video frames, where the individual IDs are unavailable.We tested this method and various models based on the DI-NOv2 transformer architecture on a dataset of meerkatscollected at the Wellington Zoo. Our method achieves atop-1 re-identification accuracy of 49%, which is higherthan that of the best DINOv2 model (42%). We found thatthe model can match observations of individuals where hu-mans cannot, and our model (RoVF) performs better thanthe comparisons with minimal fine-tuning. In future work,we plan to improve these models by using pre-text tasks, ap-ply them to animal behaviour classification, and perform ahyperparameter search to optimise the models further.",
