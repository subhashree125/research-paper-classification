    ". Can you provide further clarification for evaluating interoperability (especially standard of excellence)?": "For the minimum standard, the documentation must explain how the dataset can be integrating with other data and workflows. For the standard of excellence, the data and metadata must use controlled vocabularies and link to other resources with qualified references. For example, metadata can be creating using controlled vocabularies like the W3C's Data Catalog Vocabulaire (DCAT) model which defines terms like dataset vs data service, catalog (as a subclass of dataset), and so on. Please see this blurb from FAIR about qualifiing references: A qualified reference is a cross-reference that explains its intent. goal therefore is to create as many meaningful links as possible between (meta)data resources to enrich the contextual knowledge about the data, balanced against time/energy involved in making a good data model. To be more concrete, you should specify if one dataset builds on another data set, if additional datasets are needed to complete the data, or if complementary information is stored in a different dataset. Furthermore, all datasets need to be properly citing (i. , included their globally unique and persistent identifiers).",

    "perspective so that the adoption of data curation that we practical benefits and within ML community": "Simply having two varying perspectives on the same dataset and same criterion helped create a more nuanced view, and this triangulation of perspectives often enriched the debate and reflection on data practices. Particularly, it is the different points of view that enabled the rubric to take shape in which both data curation and ML concepts were harmonized. My commitments to interdisciplinarity and feminist perspectives are influenced by my positions as a mixed-race woman, first generation university student, and settler in Canada. I also work as a data scientist with the federal government, where I develop AI/ML governance and support the implementation of AI/ML projects. In my academic research, I draw on data and information practice scholarship, intersectional feminist and queer data studies, and interdisciplinary studies. Reyna: I am an Asian female PhD student. He is attuned to both the potential and the challenges of scaling technology in contexts vulnerable to climate change. This understanding is driven by my passion for studying climate change and the potential and limitations of machine learned to address it. Through my doctoral research, I have embraced multifaceting and inclusive approach, strived to balance technical excellence with ethical considerations. Ciara: I am a PhD candidate at a faculty of information, where my primary research focus is on how people work with cross-domain data. My primary academic trained is in computer science and statistics, with a focus on climate informatics. Harshit: HG brings perspective informed by his background in data science and information technology, shaping by his studies in South Asia. The composition of this team proved well-suiting for doing the translation and operationalizing process of data curation for ML. These disagreements were deliberated to reach balance between points of view. His position is situating at the intersections between machine learning, environmental policy, and health outcomes. As with other technical work, the neutral stance is illusory. Fields concerned with curation have also grappled with the realization that they cannot be neutral at all. When assembling the team, senior researchers intentionally selected candidates with diverse perspectives. Throughout my PhD journey, I have recognized the importance of adopting a critical approach that incorporates ethics, responsibility, and sustainability in technology. Our perspectives interacted most directly in the making of the rubric. As consequence, current archival thought now recognizes and explores the implications of the subjective and inherently political nature of archival processes such as appraisal: the decision what to keep and what to discard [122:162]. Other teams with diverse compositions with interest in ML data practices as well as interdisciplinarity complementarity may produce different assessment results, but combination of perspectives will be valuable. This includes advocating for the responsible use of machine learning to tackle climate change emphasizing the importance of sustainability and social justice in my work. In his work at the Department of Computer Science, HG evaluates how technological advancements can be balanced against their environmental impacts, striving to produce evidence that supports stringent environmental standards through a public health lens.",
