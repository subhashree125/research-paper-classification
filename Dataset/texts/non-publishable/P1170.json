Using 5 similar multimodal embeddings best F1 score 0. 628 and we will be using this modelfor backtesting 2. The TS2Vec and multimodalstrategies may have improved performance had we alonger but leave this investigation for future research. Consideringthis case is important because when model chooses 2it does nothing so does not incur any profit or loss. If chooses 0 or 1 but the truth is 2 even ifthe models decision is wrong, it or loss since the volatility that time frame wouldbe small. Significant gains or losses happen when the modelpredicts 0 or and the truth action is 1."
