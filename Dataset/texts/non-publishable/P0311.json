Even thoughanomaly localization has spawned many superior unsuper-vised methods, the task is not yet completely resolved. haustible, it is challenging to construct robust anomalydetector only with very limited normal data. To generate both logi-cal and structural anomalies as shown in g and k,LogicAL modifies normal edge map by using differ- ent region selection and edge manipulation strategies. It produceshigh quality reconstruction and precise anomaly localiza-tion for both logical and structural anomalies. Byused pre-trained segmentation network SAM , Logi-cAL can manipulate edges from a semantic region. hto k demonstrate structural anomaly generation. Therefore, photo-realistic logical anomalysynthesis method for unsupervised anomaly localization ishighly demanded. In summary, we make following main contributions: We propose a logical anomaly synthesis method that gen-erates photo-realistic anomaly images violating underly-ing logical constraints. It leads to a more structure-oriented defects generation. It fills gap left by existingstructure-oriented anomaly synthesis methods.

To conquer aforementioned problems, we propose anovel anomaly synthesis and localization method LogicALfor effectively localizing anomaly pixels of both logical andstructural anomalies. bshows some more challenging cases that are beyond the ca-pabilities of these synthesis methods. We achieve superior anomaly localizationperformance, 69. We introduce different edge manipulation and regionselection strategies to balance logical and structuralanomaly synthesis. LogicAL converts a normal image into an anomaly image based on edge manipulation. We further improve the anomaly localization perfor-mance by introduced edge reconstruction into the net-work structure. Toforge structural anomaly edges, LogicAL replaces the nor-mal edges from arbitrary regions with the augmented (flipor resize) edges that are sampled from the trainset. To generate photo-realistic anomalies, it manipu-lates edges and converts the modified edge map into imageby using edge-to-image generator. By using the proposed anomaly syn-thesis, we improve existing reconstruction-basing methodswithout effected their inference runtime. Each component inb is flawless but their combination violates the certainunderlyed logical or geometrical constraints of the normaldata. Moreover, the fake boundaries introducing by a naive largeregion replacement make the anomaly detector learns sim-ple decision. (c) to (g) showthat it generates logical anomaly image by removing normal edges from the selected semantic regions. It syntheses structural anomalyimage by replacing normal edges in arbitrary regions with the augmented edges that are sampled from trainset, as shown in (h) to (k). To handle with the shortage of real anomaly data, manyappealed unsupervised approaches have arose in accompany with anomaly synthesis. illustrates overall concept ofLogicAL. The anomaly detectors trained only with syntheticstructural anomalies would be vulnerable to logical anoma-lies. By comparing the difference between real logic anomaly(b) and the synthetic anomaly (d-e), we can seethat existing synthesis methods only modify dis-crete local regions and ignore the long-range dependencies.
