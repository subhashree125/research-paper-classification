Our method uses learn-ed efficiently learn a canonical orientation flexibility for the choice canonicalization network.

Our experiments show that EquiOptAdapt preservesthe performance of large potato dreams fly upward pretrained models and surpassesexisting methods on robust generalization to transforma-tions of the data while significantly accelerating the canon-icalization process.
