    "arXiv:2411.10180v1 [cs.CV] 15 Nov 2024": "In this paper, we introduce a novel Auto-Regressive Im-age Generation approach that constructs high-quality im-ages by progressively assembling a scene in a hierarchicalmanner. This method closely emulates a humanapproach to image creationstarting with a foundationalsketch and refining it with increasing levels of detail. These models use visual tokenizers that convert continuousimages into grids of 2D tokens, enabling AR models to learnnext-token prediction. els tackle image generation in a patch-wisemanner, further supporting an iterative image generation ap-proach. These components are then encoded into multi-scaledetail token maps. Recent studies in AR mod-eling indicate that the sequence in which image tokensare processed during AR learning can substantially affectmodel performance. The Contributions of this paper include:. The process begins with the creation of a smoothbase image, which is then enhanced through iterative ad-dition of finer details, resulting in a coherent final image(see ). This structured, iterative process aligns with a nat-ural order of image formation, enhancing both quality andinterpretability in the generation process. The Auto-Regressive process initiateswith a 11 token, predicting successive token-maps to con-struct the base component of the image. Despite the success of AR methods in natural languageprocessing, replicating similar advancements in computervision has proven challenging.",
