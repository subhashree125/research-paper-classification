    "(d)": "Mapping and state estimation in dynamic yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously environmentsis a classical problem in robotics. Additionally, our 4D neural representation can bealso used for static mapping (c) and dynamic object removal (c). Our proposed method falls into the last category andallows us to model dynamics directly in the map represen-tation leading to a spatio-temporal map representation. Common waysare: (1) filtered dynamics from the input as a pre-processing step, which requires a semantic inter-pretation of scene; (2) modeling the occupancy in themap representation , where dynam-ics can be implicitly removed by retrospectively removingmeasurements in free space; (3) including it in the state es-timation to model which measurementsoriginated from the dynamic and static parts of environ-ment. Approaches forsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) can applydifferent strategies to deal with dynamics.",
