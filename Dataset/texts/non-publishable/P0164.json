More Qualitative Results": "Akey observation from these results is that, in numerous in-stances, absolute precision in situation estimation is not aprerequisite for our model to accurately deduce answersto the posed questions. We show more qualitative results of our model in Figures Cand D. Visualization encompasses a diverse array of tasks,including queries about object orientation, characteristicsof specific objects, the count of objects within scene,and yes/no questions basing on commonsense reasoning. This finding highlights the modelsrobustness and its capacity to effectively handle a variety ofquery types, even with less optimal situational awareness.",
