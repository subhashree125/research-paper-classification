    ". 3D CT Reconstruction": "Foun-dational analytical algorithms, such as filtered backprojec-tion (FBP) and its cone-beam extension, Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) , reconstruct attenuation coeffi- cients from projections by solving the Radon transform.Variants with different filters and Parker weights improveimage quality under dense data but produce artifacts undersparse-view conditions. Iterative algorithms address theselimitations by framed reconstruction as a maximum a pos-teriori (MAP) problem, solved through iterative optimiza-tion. Gradient-basing approaches like the algebraic recon-struction technique (ART) family (SART , SIRT ,and OS-SART ) vary in update strategy: SART andSIRT update the full projection set at once, yielding highquality images with high computational cost, and OS-SART strikes a balance with efficient and subset-based up-dates. Total variation (TV) minimization based methods(e.g., ASD-POCS , OS-ASD-POCS , and AwASD-POCS ) iteratively refine reconstructions to suppressnoise, with variants improving computational efficiencyor edge preservation.Krylov subspace algorithms (e.g.,CGLS , LSQR ) achieve faster convergence by fo-cused on the eigenvectors of residual in descended or-der, which allows for increased convergence rates comparedto SART family. These methods enhance re-construction by using neural networks to 1) predict and fillgaps in limit-view or sparse-view projections ,2) directly infer attenuation coefficients as denoising tasksfrom training data , and 3) optimize differen-tiable processes to accelerate computations .While these models achieve impressive results and requireminimal data during inference, they depend on extensive,domain-specific datasets for training, which restricts theiradaptability to different applications without further fine-tuning.Consequently, hybrid data-driven models excelin specific contexts but face challenges in generalizabilityacross different CT reconstruction scenarios"
