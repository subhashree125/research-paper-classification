Weobserve that there are at most L + z K+M + 4 effective non-isomorphic bulbs among residents(defined in , the proof of Proposition 4.5) because of the followings: 1) If branches areperfectly matching and overlapped, there are at most L pairs of them rooted at i and another L pairsrooted at j.

We observe that there are at most 4(K + M 1) edgesfrom invading branches, which might be attaching to at most 4(K +M 1) resident branches.
