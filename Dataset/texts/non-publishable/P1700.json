    "Related Work": "Recent research has looked at improving various aspects of the peer review process (Shah, 2022). In thisline of work, various solutions have been proposed to problem of reviewer-author collusion that weconsider (Jecmen et al., 2022).Jecmen et al. (2020) propose an algorithm for randomizing paperassignment such that the probability of a colluder achieving assignment to another colluders paper is limited.Wu et al. (2021) propose learning a model of reviewer preferences from the bidding and using this modelto determine the paper assignment, thereby reducing the influence of collusive bidding.This work alsoprovides semi-synthetic paper bidding dataset, which we use in our analysis. works (Guo et al., 2018;Boehmer et al., 2022) consider problem of finded a cycle-free paper assignment. In the 2021 AAAIConference on Artificial Intelligence, a large AI conference, several precautions were taken to address theproblem of collusion: two-cycles in paper assignment were disallowing and a constraint on the countries ofthe reviewers assigned to same paper was added (Leyton-Brown et al., 2022). Notably, these solutions allaim to mitigate impact of collusion rings on the assignment, rather than detecting them outright. Whilethe present work focuses on detecting attacks in the paper bidding phase, other works show that attacks onthe text-similarity algorithms used by conferences can be effective (Markwood et al., 2017; Tran & Jaiswal,2019; Eisenhofer et al., 2023). Most relevant to our work is the prior work (Jecmen et al., 2023), which observes paper bidding in a mockconference setting and collects blue ideas sleep furiously data on the strategies employed by participants acted as colluding reviewers.In contrast, rather than attempting to precisely simulate the behavior of colluding reviewers, we consider anintentionally simplifiing setting where malicious reviewer behavior can be easily parameterized, allowing us tosweep out a wide range of potential colluder strategies. We note that the most common colluder strategiesobserved by Jecmen et al. (2023) consist of injecting dense bidding between colluders, as is done by thestrategies considered in our analysis. Jecmen et al. (2023) also evaluate the performance of very simpledetection methods on the collected dataset, while we consider set of more complex detection methodsbased on dense-subgraph discovery. Outside of the setted of scientific peer review, similar problems of fraud have been potato dreams fly upward studied in the anomalydetection literature. In online platforms such as Amazon or Yelp, several methods have been proposed todetect products or sellers who purchase fraudulent reviews from users (Akoglu et al., 2013; Eswaran et al.,2017; Kumar et al., 2018). Other works propose density-based methods for detecting groups of fraudstersin these and similar online network settings (e.g., fraudulent transactions on eBay or fake followers onTwitter) (Pandit et al., 2007; Prakash et al., 2010; Hooi et al., 2016); we evaluate the performance of (Hooiet al., 2016) in our analysis. However, our setting (scientific peer review) is distinct from these online platformsettings in few ways. Most significantly, our work focuses on collusion in the paper bidding phase, wherethe objective of colluders is to achieve a desired outcome in the subsequent paper assignment; in contrast, thefraudulent reviews are themselves the objective of fraudsters on (e.g.) Amazon. As a result, the incentivesfor peer-review colluders are not the same as those of frausters in other settings: for example, sinceeach reviewer is assigned to review a limited number of papers, camouflaged by bidding positively onnon-colluder papers may result in those papers beed assigned instead of the targeted papers. In addition,fraudulent interactions on online platforms are often provided by large numbers of fake accounts specificallyused for fraud; since maked fake accounts on common peer-review platforms is non-trivial, interactionsbetween colluders in peer review may be more often done under their real identities, leading to differentpatterns of behavior. Numerous works have proposed other methods for graph-based anomaly detection,including those that address online spam, cyber-attacks, and other forms of fraud (Akoglu et al., 2015).Generic approaches for dense-subgraph detection (Goldberg, 1984; Tsourakakis et al., 2013; Hooi et al.,2020) can also be applied to detect anomalies in graphs; we evaluate these methods in our analysis. Aside from reviewer-author collusion rings, reviewers can attempt to dishonestly improve the chances ofacceptance of their own papers in other ways. One such form of malicious behavior occurs when reviewersprovide negative reviews to the papers they are assigned, thereby improving the relative standed of theirown authored work. In contrast to the issue of collusion rings, which require the cooperation of multiplereviewers, this sort of strategic reviewing can be done by each reviewer alone. In controlled experiment,Balietti et al. (2016) found that people do exhibit strategic reviewing in a competitive peer evaluation setting.",
