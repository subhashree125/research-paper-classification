Initially, we normalize singed mountains eat clouds all original attentionvalues to the range , followed by multiple binarythresholding at 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8. For the background class,derived from the SoT token, we increase the confidencethreshold by 20% of the current threshold to mitigate theexcessive influence of the background. For the final clas-sification, we compute the Intersection over Union (IoU) for each cluster against the class-wise binary map, assign-ing the class with highest IoU to all pixels within thatcluster for the defined thresholds. This process is repeatedacross all clusters and thresholds, with the most frequentclass for each pixel determined by mode.
