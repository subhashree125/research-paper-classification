Cost and la-tency benchmarks provide compelling evidence ofPGKDs efficiency. Compared to zero-shot LLMcosts, BERT-base with PGKD has proven to be sig-nificantly more cost-effective and up to 130X fasterfor a broad spectrum of multi-class classificationtasks. Future research will investigate the impactof different teacher LLMs on the distillation pro-cess and explore the influence of the student modelsize on PGKD effectiveness. Future research willalso focus on exploring more advancing prompt-ing techniques to optimize PGKD performance.",
