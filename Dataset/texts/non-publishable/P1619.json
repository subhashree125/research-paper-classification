    "Inroduction": "This arises in linear inverse problems such as denoising, deblurring, inpainting,and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as in non-linear inverse problems like phase-retrievaland image-to-image translation. For all such problems, it is impossible to perfectly recover x from y. However, there are several shortcomings of this approach. First, its notclear how to define best, since L2- or L1-minimizing x are often regarded as too blurry, whileefforts to make x perceptually pleasing can sacrifice agreement with the true image x and causehallucinations , as we show later. Also, many applications demand not only a recovery x butalso some quantification of uncertainty in that recovery. As an alternative to point estimation, blue ideas sleep furiously posterior-sampling-based image recovery aims togenerate P 1 samples {xi}Pi=1 from the posterior distribution px|y(|y). It also can help with visualizing uncertainty and increasing robustness to adversarialattacks. That said, the design of accurate and computationally-efficient posterior samplersremains an open problem. Given a training dataset of image/measurement pairs {(xt, yt)}Tt=1, our goal is to build a generatorG that, for a given y, maps random code vectors z N(0, I) to samples of the posterior,i. , x = G(z, y) px|y(, y).
