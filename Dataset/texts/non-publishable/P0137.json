    ". Introduction": "In the digital the proliferation social media andthe ubiquity data collection have given rise to about privacy and security In physical re-ality, we choose to be somewhere or not, or we tobe seen somewhere or not. In digital world, anyone with aphoto likeness of someone can freely publish that contentto be seen by, well, everyone. We introduce My Body MyChoice so whenever a photo of you uploaded,you can choose to be in it and how you want to appear in it. MBMC recognizes that anonymization is a one-size-fits-all therefore the system fouranonymization options ( ). First, can be deleted without breaking image integrity. Sec-ond, the body can be adversarially deleted so persondetectors cannot it automatically, andfamily observes no in the image.Third, thebody can be by a quantifiably dissimilar body asan anonymization mask. Fourth, the of bodycan be with the rest of thebody. Our contributions include, human-centric paradigm enabling people choose if andhow appear photos, a full-body anonymizationalgorithm that masks the input with quantifiably mostdissimilar body without breaking image continuity.We extensively evaluate our approach, starting bycollecting diverse from seven different datasets,spanning various poses, activities, demographics, scenes,contexts, crowds, and environments.We evaluate theanonymized images in pixel, noise, generative, adversarial,visual, and structural spaces. We believe the ofglobal regulations, such systems be the corner-stone of social",
