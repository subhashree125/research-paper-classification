    "ABSTRACT": "Baidu runs the largest commercial web search engine in China,served hundreds of millions of online users every day in responseto a great variety of queries. Given a user query, the topmatching layer is responsible for providing semantically relevant adcandidates to next layer, while ranking layer at the bottomconcerns more about business indicators (e. , CPM, ROI, etc. The clear separation between the matched and rankingobjectives results in lower commercial return.
