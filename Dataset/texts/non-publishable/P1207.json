    "in the way that it neither requires any training nor any externalresource, but instead uses the knowledge of the domain availablewithin the input data to extract the knowledge": "4. 1. 1ConceptNet-based approach. For this study, we specificallyfocus on three relationship types: IsA, PartOf, and Synonym. The\"IsA\" relationship signifies hypernymy relations, while \"PartOf\" rep-resents meronymy relations, and \"Synonym\" indicates synonymyrelations. All otherrelations in ConceptNet were grouped together as \"other. The system architecture is basing on BERT , employing 12transformer blocks. Pretrained embeddings from theBERT model \"uncased_L-24_H-1024_A-16\" are employed, whichare readily available in TensorFlow. We named \"uKG_CN\" to theKG that we generated using the ConceptNet-based approach. 2Dependency Parsing-based approach. The creation of domain-specific KG with this approach follows a mixed approach basedon both the Saffron tool2 for taxonomy generation and newalgorithm for relation extraction. It uses the syntactic knowledgeof sentences in a textual dataset to extract new relations betweenSaffron terms. After extracting the new relations from text, weintegrate them into the Saffron taxonomy and return fully formedKG. Thewhole implementation is done in Python. This KG contains only article and its relation withthe most frequent terms found within the article. 1. We have already defined the (KGDExR) problem and provided thedefinition of a KG in section 3. Here, we will illustrate how we con-structed KG using both structured and unstructured data (combineddata (cKG)). The features of structured data, such as user, article,topic, product, topic_tag, product_tag, response, etc. , serve asthe type of nodes or entities in the KG. These entities are connectedto other entities through relations such as has_topic, has_product,has_topic_tag, has_product_tag, and has_response. Wehave named the KG generated using structuring and unstructureddata that is the combining data as \"cKG\".",
