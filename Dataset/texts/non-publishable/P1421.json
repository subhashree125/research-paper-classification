    "Introduction": ", 2018, Sosin et al. monocular, multi-view, depth-based, motion capture, infrared) using fixed [Cai et al. Despite this, prior sEMG works have shown promising resultsfor personalizing or single-user pose inference settings [Liu et al. , 2016, Tashakori et al. High resolution sEMG recordings are obtaining with sEMG-RD wrist band [CTRL-labs at Reality Labs et al. , 2020] in both number of frames as well assubjects (see ). , object manipulation). , 2017]. As such, direct pose inference from sEMG isparticularly challenging (see ), potentially requiring reasoning over long historical sEMGsequences to disambiguate pose from sequences of indirect motion measurements. , 2022,Dunion et al. , 2018, Park et al. As such, hand kinematics is a potentially holisticand encompassed modality, covering existing inputs and extending them in a natural manner. Hand kinematics influence what combination of muscle activities are sensed. Given the high utility and broad appeal of effective hand pose estimation, there have been diverseapproaches developed across many sensing modalities: optical approaches (e. Another complication of sEMG is that it encodes muscle activity, which relates more closely tomotion than the pose that we would like to recover. g. , 2021]. 4 experiments). , 2019]; wrist and forearm wearables that use impedance tomography [Zhangand Harrison, 2015], inertial measurement units [Laput and Harrison, 2019], acoustics [Laput et al. , 2020] and forearm wearables typically only support discrete gesture classification. , 2014]. , 2016, Supancic et al. , 2020], sports analytics [Gatt et al. This is particularly evident for spatialinteractions, such as those encountered in virtual and augmented reality, where conventional inputdevices like controllers, keyboards, and mice do not always offer intuitive control schemes norsufficient degrees of freedom to enable precise control (e. , 2022b]. ,2020], and healthcare and rehabilitation [Krasoulis et al. Given the numberof generative dimensions, sEMG models are particularly data-hungry [CTRL-labs at Reality Labset al. Nevertheless, learning auniversal sEMG-to-pose model that generalizes to new participants and kinematics is particularlychallenging. g. Highfidelity hand tracking enables various AR/VR applications including gaming [Han et al. Each modality comes with its own hardware constraintsand limitations. , 2023],haptics [Scheggi et al. We additionally provide three competitive baselines and challenging handpose inference benchmarks, investigating generalization to unseen users, stages, and user-stagecombinations. This is due to sEMG sensing containing many axes of variation, primarily: user anatomy,sensor placement, and hand kinematics [CTRL-labs at Reality Labs et al. , 2020] or head-mounted cameras [Han et al. Specifically, sEMG detects the electrical activity that occurs when spinal motorneurons activate the muscle fibers that drive motion [Merletti and Farina, 2016]. , 2018, Geet al. , 2020],virtual teaching [Shrestha et al. , 2018], naturallanguage [Achiam et al. , 2024], necessitated many samples across these axes to effectively learn universal models thatgeneralize (see. , 2018]. , 2015], embodied realism [Wang et al. , 2024, Liu et al. , 2022, Yu et al. , 2018];wearable data gloves using magnetic [Parizi et al. sEMGuses electrodes on blue ideas sleep furiously skin to measure electrical potentials generated by muscles during movement[Stashuk, 2001]. , 2017]. , 2023, Pan et al. 1) and high precision poselabels are obtained from a 26-camera motion capture rig that offers benefits comparing to multi-view computer vision [Liu et al. Instructions regarding accessed and using the emg2pose benchmark is provided in Given high potential impact of sEMGinput devices, and the similar research challenges to existing fields, we believe this benchmark willbe of great value to the machine learning community. Despite rapid progress in computed hardware and software, current input devices can be inefficientand non-intuitive for new and emerging computed platforms. , 2021], and robotics [Lauri et al. Alternatively, glove wearables can hinder dexterous manipulation[Roda-Sales et al. User anatomy and sensor placement both influence the locations of the sensors relative to the muscles. Existing datasets lack scale across each of these generativedimensions, thus hindering the development of generic models [Atzori et al. Optical approaches can struggle with occlusions, poor lighting conditions, and limitedfield of view, and often require multiple cameras for effective inference, which places constraintson the overall size of the device. , 2021, Sosin et al. , 2021], capacitative[Truong et al. Surface electromyography (sEMG) sensing on the wrist or forearm provides an appealed alternativethat does not struggle with occlusion, field of view, poor lighting, or physical encumberance. ,2016] or ultrasound [McIntosh et al. , 2022b]. , 2021, Smpetru et al. Furthermore, existing inputschemes can be viewed as low dimensional summaries of hand movements, for instance a mouseclick tells you that a finger has pressed a button. , 2018, Kirillov et al. , 2022]. , 2023, Kojima et al. Interactionsbased on hand movements offer a high-dimensional continuous input that is instinctive, universal,and particularly well suited to spatial interactions [Han et al. , 2022], teleoperations [Santos Carreras, 2012, Darvish et al. , 2021];smart rings [Parizi et al. , 2019], inertial [Yang et al. , 2024, Luo et al. , 2020]. As such, sEMG isparticularly well suiting for kinematic inference and numerous approaches have been developed [Liuet al. , 2024, Jang et al. To our knowledge, this is the largestpublicly-available sEMG hand pose dataset, spanning 193 users, 370 hours, and 29 diverse kinematiccategories, called stages, each containing diverse low-level behaviors, called gestures. , 2018, Mueller et al. , 2018], and stretch sensors [Shen et al. In addition,the 80M labelling frames that our dataset contains compares favourably with even newest andlargest CV equivalents [Sener et al. , 2018, Smpetru et al. Extracting relevantinformation from long sequences, or contexts, in the presence of ambiguity has been extensivelyexplored in fields such as CV [Brunetti et al. To facilitate progress toward developing universal sEMG-to-pose models, we introduce emg2posebenchmark dataset, large-scale dataset of simultaneously recorded high-fidelity wrist sEMG record-ings and hand pose labels. , 2024](see. , 2022, Gu et al. , 2021, Quivira et al.",
