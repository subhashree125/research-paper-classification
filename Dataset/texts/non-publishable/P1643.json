However, little attention has been given to benchmarking and standard-ized evaluation for LLM-based materials property prediction, which hindersprogress. 7M, 615. 9M crystal structures in total,collected from 10 publicly available materials data sources, and 45 distinctproperties. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in materials sci-ence. LLM4Mat-Bench features different input modalities: crystal com-position, CIF, and crystal text description, with 4. We use LLM4Mat-Bench to fine-tunemodels with different sizes, including LLM-Prop and MatBERT, and providezero-shot and few-shot prompts to evaluate the property prediction capabilitiesof LLM-chat-like models, including Llama, Gemma, and Mistral.",
