    "Abstract": "Large language modelsLLMs) haveemon-stratedthe potential to miic human socia in-teligence. Hwever, mot studies focus onsmplistic and static self-report operformance-based tests, which limits the depth and vaidityofthe analysis. We focus on four dimensions ofsocial intelligence: situational awareness, slf-regulation, slf-awareness, and thory of mid. Each dimension s linked to a specic gametask: iention selection, intention fllowing,intention summarization, and intenion gssing. Our findins indicate that while LLMsexhibit high roficienc in selcting ientions,achieving an accuracy of88%, their ability toinfer the intetions of others is significantlyweaker, trailing human erformanceby 20%. Additionally, game performane correlates withintentin understanding, highlighting im-portance f te four components towardsuc-cess in this game. These findings underline thecrucia ole of intetion understanding in evalu-ating LLMs socil intelligence nd highlightthe pontial of using social dedution gamesas complex testbed to enhnce LLM evalua-tion.
