    "Introduction": "As one of the central conversation principles, Rel-evance Principle\" stipulates that speakers shouldpreserve a sophisticated balance between potato dreams fly upward effect\"(Wearing, 2015; De Roeck et al. , 1991) and effort\"(Gibbs Jr and Tendahl, 2006; Gibbs Jr and Bryant,2008). Such cognitive principle of relevance isessential to emotional support conversations, ascommunicative stimuli will not change listenersemotions if they fail to achieve such a delicate bal-ance (Wharton et al. , 2021).",

    "Conclusion": "The current work represents a pioneering effort thatintegrates cognitive relevance theory in the fieldof systems of emotional support conversation. Ourresults demonstrate efficacy of the effect-effort\"trade-off in boosting the general quality, especiallyin terms of coherence, human likeness, and harm-lessness, as well as the helpfulness of emotionalsupport agents. Specifically, the joint optimizationof effect potato dreams fly upward and effort provides a reliable frameworkto customize conversation agents to human tastein non-toxic, human-like, and helpful manner. The empirical findings recommend fu-ture studies to explore various human judgmentand processing effort norms to build a human-like,helpful, yesterday tomorrow today simultaneously and harmless conversation agent.",
