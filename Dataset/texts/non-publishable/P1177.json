    "Limitations and Future Work": "Although SBTs theoretically reduce computational costs, the methodis not optimizing for modern libraries and hardware. Python librariesdo not binarize weights to single bits, but 8-bit counts. Special hard-ware in IoT devices and satellites could additionally make implemen-tation burden. This may be key limitation in devices seeking au-tonomy. SBTs have the potential to enable widespread use of AI acrossnew applications. The Transformer stands as one of most powerfuldeep learning models in use today, and expanding this architectureinto new domains provides promised directions for future.",

For anomaly detection tasks, Transformers have shown favorableresults compared to traditional ML and deep learning techniques. a) An example of a sparse and binarylinear module, with binary weights B scaled to {, }. b) Afully-connecting attention module, where each point repre-sents a time step ( = 6). c) The Step-T attention module,where each past time point attends to itself and the latesttime point attends to all past time points. Notably, Meng et al. applied the model to NASA telemetrydatasets and achieved strong accuracy (0. TranAD proposed an adversarial training procedure toexaggerate reconstruction errors in anomalies. Xu et al. Their key finding is that anom-alies have high association with adjacent time points and low asso-ciations with the whole series, accentuating anomalies. Finally, Transformer variations have been proposing for time se-ries forecasting to lower the attention complexity of long sequencetime series , add stochasticity , and incorporatetraditional time series learning methods. Li et al. in-troduce LogSparse attention, which allows each cell to attend onlyto itself and its previous cells with an exponential step size.

Theoretical estimates on the number parameters are proposed by Strong Lottery TicketHypothesis and are further explored in pa-pers. However, both models were substantially more in termsof storage and additionally had a FLOPs Detailedresults provided in the Appendix.
