We show under a tie-breaking fornearest the LOOCV estimate the mean error for k-NN regression isidentical mean square error of (k + 1)-NN regression on data,multiplied by scaling factor (k 1)2/k2. Therefore, to compute LOOCV score, oneonly needs to (k + regression and not need to repeat training-validation of k-NN regression for the data.Numerical validity fast computation",
