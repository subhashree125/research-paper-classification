As the cloud is remote the authentication of users access data is becoming a serious This is time when the data scientists need to work classifying authenticated and the intruders accurately as efficiently. An efficient IDS is needed to be developed suffice this insecure situation. out intruders no than the ultimate tough thing, the size of data on Cloud is so large. This is why the algorithm should work such a so it processes data most efficiently compromising with the The Peafowl (PFM) Algorithm proposed in this paper has shown better through Feature Selection approach resulting in increased classification by reducing dimensions of the dataset. The authors have shown that the proposed has performed better than mentioned ones. As examined by the authors in paper, the average accuracy of algorithm during train-test scenario is 81.784% which shows the potency of this algorithm. The classification results five namely NN, KNN, Bagging RF show better results and proposed IDS. This proves that IDS model using is of securing the Cloud environment from attackers. In future, the proposed Feature algorithm can calibrated the classifiers other than ones used in this paper perform experiments which produce even better results. Therefore, an efficient IDS is created that can be deployed in a environment",

Finally, after completing all iterations, the peafowl having maximum fitness value is selected as the optimal feature subset. 4, 0. r is a random value lying in the range [0. 1 and is the dominance factor which is regulated at 0. In this way, the process continues updating as well as adding the new peafowls and fetching out top n number of peafowls every time. Now, all the peafowls are sorted in a decreasing manner with accordance to their fitness values. In the proposed model, 1 and 2 are set to 1. 8.

    ". Flowchart of the proposed model": "The Peacocks which are not so efficient are called non-dominant peacocks. These types of peacocks are called dominant ones. Those are less likely to mate with more than one peahen. e. A peacock shakes his feathers and struts around with confidence as if he owns the place. 1. , they wish to mate with as many peahens as possible. Behavior of Peafowls By the term Peafowl, both peacock and peahen are addressed. Tail feathers of a peacock can be seen underneath the feathers which are spread to attract peahens. The peahens roam around the territories, after that, they select the peacock to mate with. In the mating season, the peacocks spread their feathers to show the dominance and to prove themselves superior compared to the others. The peahens are attracted by the colorfulness as well as the intensity of the sound or mating call generated by the peacocks.",
