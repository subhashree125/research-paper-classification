  "Abstract": "The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) often confronts challenges stemmingfrom the heavy reliance on human annotators in the reinforcement learning with humanfeedback (RLHF) framework, or the frequent and costly external queries tied to the self-instruct paradigm. In this work, we pivot to Reinforcement Learning (RL)but with a twist.Diverging from the typical RLHF, which refines LLMs following instruction data training, weuse RL to directly generate the foundational instruction dataset that alone suffices for fine-tuning. Our method, TeaMs-RL, uses a suite of textual operations and rules, prioritizingthe diversification of training datasets.It facilitates the generation of high-quality datawithout excessive reliance on external advanced models, paving the way for a single fine-tuning step and negating the need for subsequent RLHF stages.Our findings highlightkey advantages of our approach: reduced need for human involvement and fewer modelqueries (only 5.73% of the strong baselines total), along with enhanced capabilities ofLLMs in crafting and comprehending complex instructions compared to strong baselines,and substantially improved model privacy protection.

  "Introduction": "In the dynamic realm of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been a pronounced migration of theircapabilities into diverse sectors, from chat robots (OpenAI, 2023; Zhao et al., 2023a; Touvron et al., 2023a)and robotics (Ahn et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2023), to autonomous driving (Fu et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023).Amidst this broad applicability, the capacity to train with targeted instructions and pertinent responseshas been integral for optimizing performance.LLMs, such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), Llama-1 (Touvron et al., 2023a), and Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), are exemplarsof this trend, showcasing enhanced capabilities when furnished with explicit human-generated instructions.Conventionally, this entailed considerable human input in both instruction creation and response generation,leading to expansive datasets for fine-tuning (Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022). Emerging from predominantly human-instructed models, a crucial inquiry emerges: Can LLMs be fine-tuned to adeptly handle complex instructions without human feedback?The potential gains from thisdirection are multifaceted. Chief among them is the direct cut in costs tied to human annotations (Askellet al., 2021).Beyond the monetary aspect, such a transition also alleviates potential biases seeded byhuman curators (Gallegos et al., 2023). A loftier, albeit less conspicuous aim, is to amplify the quality ofinstructions and boost model performance. Several methodologies have surfaced in pursuit of these merits.",
  "expert LLM": ": Comparative overview of LLM alignment techniques. Current methods (red shaded region)typically involve a two-phase process, starting with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of a pre-aligned LLMusing a dataset of human-crafted instructions and corresponding responses (often sourced from an expertLLM like ChatGPT), leading to a post-SFT LLM. This is then fine-tuned using RLHF, where humanfeedback on preferences is incorporated, resulting in a post-RLHF LLM. In contrast, our TeaMs-RL method(green shaded region) employs a single-phase SFT approach, initially utilizing RL for teaching expert LLMsto generate high-quality instructions. We train an RL policy (instructor LLM) to create diverse instructions(with the diversity evaluated by a reviewer LLM as a reward signal). Once trained, the instructor LLMproduces a set of actions to teach an expert LLM to generate high-quality instructions, and the instructionsare leveraged to query the expert LLM to form the SFT instruction dataset. This approach capitalizes onthe strengths of RL to enhance the complexity of instructions and consequently the value of responses fromthe expert LLM. Note that the expert LLMs are not involved in the training of the RL policy; we onlyuse the instructor and the reviewer LLM for training the RL policy. The expert LLM is used to generateinstructions and corresponding responses under the guidance of the trained RL policy. The self-instruct method by Wang et al. (2022) pioneers this direction by using some external LLM togenerate responses to human-generated seed instructions for instruction dataset curation. A notable recentdevelopment is the evolutionary strategy presented by Xu et al. (2024). Here, LLMs are seeded with initialinstructions, gradually evolving towards generating more complex directives within predefined constraints.Despite their methods commendable performance relative to alternative models, it necessitates a multitudeof interactions with an expert LLM (e.g., advanced LLMs such as ChatGPT), potentially raising concernsregarding resource demands. In this research, we propose a novel method to improve instruction quality with the principles of Reinforce-ment Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018), hence enhancing LLMs ability to comprehend and effectivelyexecute intricate instructions without human involvement, while also boosting model privacy protection. Ourmethod, outlined in the green shaded region of , begins with training an instructor LLM (RL policy)for teaching an expert to generate diverse, complex instructions. These are then used to elicit expert LLMresponses, forming a diversity-enhanced instruction dataset. The final stage of supervised fine-tuning (SFT)of a pre-alignment LLM (e.g., Llama-1) with this dataset enhances its complex task processing capabilities.Notably, our study shows that the thoughtful framing of instructions (using RL) is equally, if not more,crucial than generating responses from external sources such as expert LLMs or human feedback. Moreover,to clarify our methodology and facilitate replication, we provide a detailed example illustrating the inputsand outputs at each stage of our process, similar to , see Appendix A.",

The output is wrong.",
  "Related Work and Contribution": "A multitude of studies have explored the training of language models using instructions paired with theirrespective responses. Notable works in this realm include GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI,2023), Flan collection (Longpre et al., 2023), Flan models (Wei et al., 2021), and Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023).The prevalent methodology often requires human annotators to craft instructions and curate correspondingresponses, leading to the assembly of detailed instruction-response datasets. Such datasets, exemplified bythe one used in GPT-3s training (Brown et al., 2020), tend to resonate well with human preferences andmarkedly improve language model proficiency. However, (crowd) sourcing these datasets through humanmeans can be not only costly but also prone to issues of bias (Gallegos et al., 2023). Conversely, the self-instruct approach (Wang et al., 2022) charts a different course by tapping into the poten-tial of LLMs to autonomously generate both instructions and their responses, facilitated by the provision ofpredefined seeds. While this strategy alleviates the dependence on human effort, it might not consistently cap-ture the breadth and depth of diverse instructions and responses typically achieved with human annotators.Building on the pioneering self-instruct methodology, Xu et al. (2024) introduced WizardLM, an evolution-ary instruction approach. In WizardLM, initial instructions drawn from the Evol Alpaca dataset undergoadaptation through the amalgamation of command instructions and expert LLMs such as ChatGPT. Owingto its commendable performance in both formulating and adhering to intricate instructions, WizardLM hasgarnered considerable attention. However, its reliance on random sampling of command instructions couldfall short in improving the breadth and richness of instructions fed to the LLMs. Furthermore, the heavydependence on external expert modelscommonplace in prevailing self-instruct methodsposes concernsnot just economically, but also in terms of environmental impact. Departing from these precedents, our methodology uniquely uses RLto help generate foundational fine-tuning instruction data rather than for post-tuning refinements (such as RLHF (Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyanget al., 2022)). Our key technical contribution is the formulation of a Markov Decision Process (MDP)to train an instructor LLM as an RL policy, adeptly tailored for contextualized instruction manipulations,thereby enabling alignment through SFT on small, high-quality datasets. In contrast to WizardLMs ap-proach of treating text manipulations as ordinal selections, our MDP framework encodes them in a continuousaction space, enabling a more refined differentiation of the intricate effects of textual manipulations (carriedout by the instructor LLM) on the quality of instructions. Also, unlike the intricate task of crafting well-structured tree instructions required by Tree-Instruct (Zhao et al., 2023b), our MDP can be resolved usingTRPO (Schulman et al., 2015) (with other common methods being applicable). This approach alleviates thecombinatorial complexity inherent in sequential instruction actions, allowing for iterative policy refinement(with TRPO offering the added benefit of guaranteed monotonic progression). Empirically, we demonstratethe efficacy of SFT alignment on a small but high-quality dataset across benchmarks such as ARC and Hel-laSwag with foundational pre-aligned models such as Llama-1 and Llama-2 (refer to for details).Additionally, comparative experiments on model privacy attacks reveal that our method markedly enhancesmodel privacy protection (.3).",
  "Method": "We first train an instructor LLM policy (Sec. 3.1) based on a continuous action space encoding (Sec. 3.1.1)and diversity rules as a reward function (Sec. 3.1.2), a strategy designed to foster the generation of high-quality instructions with an expert LLM such as ChatGPT. Subsequently, using this policy and the expertLLM, we create an instruction-response dataset to fine-tune a pre-aligned LLM. Importantly, our enricheddataset allows bypassing the usual RLHF phase, resulting in a post-SFT LLM that is already proficient inresponding to complex instructions. Also, the instruction policy is transferable for aligning various foundationLLMs such as Llama-1-chat-7b and Llama-2-chat-7b. Note that our method has been primarily tested onLlama models. There may be performance variations when applying our method to other models. Thisincludes considerations regarding differences in model architecture and computational requirements, whichcould impact the effectiveness of our approach when transferred to models beyond Llama.",
  "Initial": "instruction S1S2S3 S4S5S6S7S8S9 A1A2A3 A1A3A3A2A1A2 final instruction : RL policy search for LLMinstruction generation. A denotes ac-tions (prompts), S denotes states (in-structions), and the green line indi-cates the optimal instruction genera-tion achieved during the policy search. To train the RL policy (i.e., instructor LLM1), we utilize the open-source WizardLM-13b model2,3 as the reviewer LLM, which providesa diversity score for the current instruction set as the reward signal.WizardLM-13b, being a cost-effective option, can capture instructionnuances for reliable reward evaluation (Sec. 3.1.2). The training procedure comprises several key stages. First, we se-lect a single initial instruction, such as How to cook food. Thischosen instruction is then input into our instructor model. Second,we leverage the reviewer LLM to evaluate the instructor modelsperformance and provide reward signals. The policy training con-cludes if the rewards demonstrate convergence or the iteration limitis reached. Following this iterative training phase, we use the instruc-tor LLM to generate complex instructions using a tailored actionspace (Sec. 3.1.1). In the final phase, the reviewer LLM assesses thediversity of the generated instructions to ensure instruction quality(Sec. 3.1.2). To further illustrate how to leverage RL to train the instructor, wefirst model the RL process with a Markov Decision Process (MDP).An intuitive example is shown in , it illustrates RL policysearch for LLM instruction generation, where A represents actions(prompts), S represents states (instructions), and the green pathdenotes the optimal instruction generation. An MDP is present as(S, A, P, r, ), where S denotes the state space, A denotes the action space, the transition probability functionis P : S A S , the reward function is denoted as r : S A R and denotes the discountfactor.In an MDP, we aim to maximize the expected cumulative reward values, which are defined as",
  "Action Set": "Inspired by WizardLM (Xu et al., 2024), we leverage several actions to generate complex instructions, includ-ing breadth action, add constraint, deepening, concretizing, increase reasoning steps, complicateinput (Xu et al., 2024). However, distinct from WizardLM, we map this discrete set into a continuousspace by using a language encoding to represent each action, which is then used for a policy to generateinstructions. This enables inherently capturing contextual nuances for direct comparison between actionsvia their Q values. The details of each action are in Appendix C.",
  "Reward Settings": "In this section, consider an evaluation prompt g. If g is characterized as equal, the corresponding rewardr is designated as 0. Otherwise, r is set to 1. The term equal here refers to semantic equivalence. Itis noteworthy that the judgment is determined by the reviewer LLM. For instance, when conformity existsbetween the initial and subsequent instructions, the reward r is 0. In contrast, a lack of conformity yields areward value of 1. For example, an evaluation prompt = Here are two Instructions to ChatGPT AI, do you think they areequal to each other, which meet the following requirements: 1. They have same constraints and requirments.2. They have same depth and breadth of the inquiry. The First Instruction: +instruction + . TheSecond Instruction: + state + .

  "Fine-tune a Pre-Aligned LLM": "As illustrated in , an approach is adopted to optimize cost-efficiency considerations during the phasededicated to fine-tuning a pre-aligned LLM. Specifically, we use the initial instructions from the Alpacadataset. The fine-tuning process is executed as follows: We first employ the Alpaca dataset4 as the initial set ofinstructions and input the initial instructions into the expert LLM like ChatGPT. Next, we apply our trainedinstruction generation policy (derived from the Instructor LLM) to guide the Expert LLM (ChatGPT) ingenerating high-quality instructions. Specifically, this policy acts as a teacher directing the Expert LLMto produce instructions that meet our quality criteria. The instructor LLM provides different responsesduring the RL training process. Expert LLM is used to generate instructions and their associated responses,it serves as the source of knowledge and expertise.Then, the expert LLM produces responses to thesehigh-quality instructions. With the instructions and responses in hand, we fine-tune the pre-aligned LLMslike Llama-1-chat-7b and Llama-2-chat-7b via a supervised fine-tuning way (SFT)a cost-effective way toenhance LLM capabilities. Finally, we can have the post-SFT LLMs, such as TeaMs-RL-1-7b.",
  "Practical Algorithms": "The practical training process is outlined in Algorithm 1, which describes the training pipeline. A moredetailed algorithm can be found in Algorithm 2, provided in Appendix B. In our training process, in orderto teach expert LLMs how to generate high-quality instructions, we leverage the RL policy we have trainedto prompt expert LLMs to generate instructions step by step. Building on the training process, we fine-tuned an LLM called TeaMs-RL. Note that we have the flexibility to choose any other RL methods forpolicy training, here we choose TRPO (Schulman et al., 2015) (TRPO is not the only choice), though it haslonger training times versus alternatives like Proximal Policy Optimization. We select TRPO for its rigorousadvantage function handling and theoretical guarantees of monotonic improvement.",
  "Enhancement of Instruction Diversity": "We deploy a policy that is designed to orchestrate a trajectory consisting of six distinct instruction actions,in accordance with the training process to facilitate the generation of instructions by expert LLMs. Note, theexpert LLMs utilized in our study, as well as those used by WizardLM, are ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4.Both models were accessed in 2023, ensuring that we employed the same versions of the ChatGPT-3.5 andChatGPT-4 models to generate instructions and responses. A noteworthy aspect of our investigation involvesa comparative assessment of the data quality resulting from the utilization of our policy, in contrast to theapproach adopted by WizardLM (Xu et al., 2024), which relies upon random sampling for data generationby querying expert LLMs. It bears emphasizing that our instruction actions are randomly initialized, butas training progresses, our policy iteratively learns to enable the instructor LLM to produce increasinglycomplex and diverse instructions. As shown in , our method reliably enhances the diversity score of the instruction set.5The maincomputation overhead is learning the instruction policy on the relatively small WizardLM-13b in less than1 hour on 2 NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs (with 896 total queries).This results in a transferable policythat reduces alignment cost across models compared to RLHFs per-model RL. Offloading to policy learningprovides an instruction set for joint tuning and alignmenta substantial benefit over tuning-only data usage.For detailed information on how to teach expert LLMs to generate instructions, please refer to Appendix D. 5In designing instruction actions, the breadth action is a single action regarding breath thoughts. Thus, we insert theaction into the middle of our trajectory to enhance breadth instructions after training a policy.",
  "Compare with WizardLM-7b on ARC and HellaSwag Benchmakrs": "To comprehensively examine the effectiveness of our method, we carry out experiments on popular bench-marks: (1) AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) benchmark (Clark et al., 2018): The benchmark introducesa fresh question set and baselines, all strategically curated to foster AI research in the realm of advancedquestion answering, setting a significantly higher bar for knowledge and reasoning capabilities compared toprevious challenges. (2) HellaSwag benchmark (Zellers et al., 2019): The benchmark introduces a challeng-ing dataset, revealing that even state-of-the-art models struggle with commonsense inference, as evidencedby the significant performance gap between humans (95% accuracy) and models (48%), achieved throughadversarial filtering, a robust data collection paradigm that selects adversarial machine-generated wronganswers by scaling up the length and complexity of dataset examples to a Goldilocks zone where the textgenerated is absurd to humans yet often misclassified by models. We trained a llama-1-7b model denoted TeaMs-RL-7b-v1.1 with our dataset of 17,878 instruction-responsepairs, the training time is about 2 hours on 4 NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs. As shown in Figures 4 and 5,our method shows superior performance over WizardLM-7b models6 in the same experimental settings.It is crucial to highlight an important aspect of our methodology in relation to data utilization.Thedataset employed for training our model is approximately one-fourteenth the size of the dataset utilizedby WizardLM, as illustrated in (a). Furthermore, (b) highlights the discernible difference inthe query count posed to ChatGPT models between our method and WizardLM, with the latter requestingChatGPT for responses more than seventeen times than TeaMs-RL. This marked contrast underscoresthe cost-effectiveness of our data generation approach, which mitigates the expenses associated withdataset acquisition and generates high-quality data. It highlights that our method is a more economicallyviable and sustainable strategy for training LLMs. For more experimental results, please see Appendix G.Note that the ChatGPT models we used to query data show performance equivalent to the ChatGPT modelsused in the baselines. In our comparison experiments, we take the same settings: 25 shots for ARC, 10 shots for HellaSwag. Inour experimental setup, all models are configured with a float16 format. We compare to WizardLM-7b sinceboth this approach and ours use llama-1-7b as the base model. Notably, WizardLM-7B queried ChatGPT624,000 times for responses, whereas our method queried open-source WizardLM13B 896 times during policytraining and ChatGPT 35,756 times during high-quality data generation; our total queries are substantiallyfewer. Therefore, we believe the comparison is fair in terms of matched base model and vastly lower queryamount. Even with the query count of WizardLM-13B, 35756 + 896 = 36652, our method can still reducethe query count by 94.13% to reach comparable outcomes, emphasizing a more economical and sustainablestrategy for LLM training.",

Addressing this problem, our method tries to handlethe dilemma of large training data and data privacy. It aims to enhance the performance of training modelswhile ensuring improved data privacy, even with limited data. As illustrated in , we have conducted a series of membership inference attack (Shokri et al., 2017;Carlini et al., 2022) experiments to assess our models privacy performance rigorously. Our model exhibitsa Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve that closely approximates random guessing, yielding anArea Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.47 in this evaluation. Conversely, the baseline model, trained on adataset comprising 44,000 samples, displays a notable deviation from random guessing, with an AUC valueof 0.72.

Birds: Birds are one of the most well-known examples of animals that fly. They have evolvedwings that are lightweight, flexible, and covered with feathers. Birds can fly by flapping theirwings or gliding through the air using air currents. They can also soar in the air without flappingtheir wings, which is called sustained flight. Some birds, like the albatross, can even fly for dayswithout stopping.2. Insects: Insects, such as bees, wasps, and moths, are also capable of flight. They have wingsthat are lightweight and covered with a thin layer of skin called cuticle. Insects fly by beatingtheir wings, which creates lift and propels them through the air. Some insects, like moths, canalso hover in the air by adjusting the angle of their wings.These are just two examples of animals that fly. There are many more, such as bats, pterosaurs,and even some species of fish that can glide through the water using their fins.",

  "Limitations": "Our method leverages RL to teach LLMs how to generate high-quality instruction fine-tuning data, aiming todiminish collection costs and the dependency on human alignment; however, it is important to note that thisresearch did not explore the potential benefits of incorporating an additional stage of human feedback, whichcould potentially enhance alignment. This leaves open the question of whether data derived from expertLLMs sufficiently aligns with human values or inherits human value deficiencies, such as biases. While ourapproach successfully reduces the reliance on external models like expert LLMs, it does not entirely eliminatetheir use. The full extent to which these models can be excluded remains an area for future exploration.Hence, while our work paves the way for greater autonomy and efficiency in data alignment, it simultaneouslyraises more questions than it answers, necessitating additional exploration. Moreover, the policy employed in instructing expert LLMs is trained using specific instructions, e.g., Howto cook food. This policy is then applied to guide expert LLMs in generating instructions from variousother initial inputs. However, it is important to note that this policy may not be universally precise for allinitial instructions. Training a distinct policy for each initial instruction presents a significant challenge, asit could be both time-consuming and costly. In the future, our research will delve into the complex interplay between these policies performance andtheir trainings associated costs. Additionally, we aim to explore the alignment of LLMs with human values,examining how these aspects can be balanced and optimized. This investigation is crucial for enhancing theefficiency and applicability of LLM training, ensuring both practicality and alignment with ethical standards.

  "TeaMs-RL-1-7b output: I understand your question, and I can provide a potential solution": "One potential solution to the problem of a man trying to open a jar is to use a jar opener. A jaropener is a tool designed to make it easier to open jars by providing a lever or a screw mechanismthat can be used to apply pressure to the lid of the jar. This can make it easier for the man toopen the jar without risking injury to his hands or fingers. Another potential solution is to use a jar-opening tool that is designed specifically for peoplewith disabilities or mobility issues. These tools can be designed to be easier to grip and use, andcan provide a more comfortable way for the man to open the jar. Another potential solution is to use a jar-opening technique that does not require much force.For example, the man could try to loosen the lid of the jar by applying pressure to the sidesof the jar, rather than trying to twist the lid off. This can be a safer and easier way to open the jar. Finally, if the man is having trouble opening the jar because the lid is stuck, he could try towarm the jar up first. Warming the jar can cause the lid to become more flexible, making iteasier to open. In conclusion, using a jar opener, a jar-opening tool for people with disabilities or mobility issues,a different jar-opening technique, or warming the jar can all be potential solutions to the problemof a man trying to open a jar. \"",

  "Task: why the sky is blue?\"": "TeaMs-RL-7b output: The sky appears blue because of the way light interacts with the Earthsatmosphere. The Earths atmosphere is made up of different gases, including nitrogen, oxygen,and carbon dioxide. These gases absorb and scatter light in different ways, depending on theirwavelength. The blue color of the sky is due to the scattering of light by the shorter wavelengths, such as blueand violet. When sunlight enters the Earths atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases,such as nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scattershorter wavelengths more than longer wavelengths. This is known as Rayleigh scattering. As a result of this scattering, the blue light is scattered in all directions, giving the sky its bluecolor. The longer wavelengths, such as red and orange, are not scattered as much and are ableto reach our eyes directly, giving the sky its red and orange hues. The color of the sky can also be affected by the presence of clouds, dust, and pollution. Thesecan scatter light in different ways, changing the color of the sky. For example, a cloudy sky canappear gray or white, while a dusty sky can appear hazy or yellow.",
