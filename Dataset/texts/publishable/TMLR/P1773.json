  "Abstract": "In a decision problem, observations are said to be material if they must be taken into accountto perform optimally. Decision problems have an underlying (graphical) causal structure,which may sometimes be used to evaluate certain observations as immaterial. For solublegraphs ones where important past observations are remembered there is a completegraphical criterion; one that rules out materiality whenever this can be done on the basisof the graphical structure alone. In this work, we analyse a proposed criterion for insolublegraphs. In particular, we prove that some of the conditions used to prove immateriality arenecessary; when they are not satisfied, materiality is possible. We discuss possible avenuesand obstacles to proving necessity of the remaining conditions.",
  "Introduction": "We can view any decision problem as having an underlying causal structure a graph consisting of chanceevents, decisions and outcomes, and their causal relationships. Sometimes, it is possible to evaluate keyaspects of a decision problem from its causal structure alone. For example, in a and b, wesee two causal structures. In each graph, there is an observation Z, which is a parent of the decision X,which affects the outcome Y . The difference is that in b, Z also directly influences Y , whereas ina, it does not. To fully describe these decision problems we must specify, for each non-decision variable, a probabilitydistribution. Each probability distribution must be conditional only on the outcomes of the directed causes(i.e. the parent variables), a condition known as Markov compatibility. In b, a Markov compatibledecision problem is shown, where the variable Z is a Bernoulli trial (i.e. a coin flip), and the decision-makeris rewarded with Y = 1 if they state the outcome of Z (i.e. call the outcome of the coin flip), otherwisethe reward is Y = 0. In this scenario, a greater reward can be attained if the decision is allowed to beconditioned on Z, and so Z is said to be material. Specifically, if it is possible to observe the Bernoulli trialbefore selecting X, then one can attain a utility of 1 surely, whereas if one cannot observe the Bernoulli trial,the maximum expected utility is 0.5. For the causal structure shown in a, however, there will exist an optimal decision rule that ignores thevalue of Z = z entirely, in other words Z is immaterial; this holds true for any decision problem compatiblewith the graph. This is evident because given any decision X = x, the observation Z is independent ofY , and so there is no need for the decision to vary with Z. (This can be proved from the fact that Z isd-separated from Y given X.) There are several reasons that we may want to evaluate whether a graph allows Z to be material. Firstly,for algorithmic efficiency if an observed variable is immaterial, then the optimal policies are containedin a small subset of all available policies, that we can search exponentially more quickly. (For example, ina, there are four deterministic mappings from Z to X, but if we let X ignore Z, then there are justtwo possible choices, X = 1 and X = 0.) Secondly, materiality can have consequences for the fairness of a decision-making procedure. Suppose thatZ designates the gender of candidates available to a recruiter, which are male (Z = 1) or female (Z = 0)",
  "Under review as submission to TMLR": "Proof. From Lemma 11, the control path d begins with a chance node. So, the first decision Ximin in dmust have a chance node Zimin as its parent along d. Furthermore, the intersection node Timin must be anancestor of Zimin along d, so it is also a chance node. So it follows from Lemma 19, that any policy mustsatisfy P (Tpiminimin= Pa(Y pimin)) = 1 if it attains the MEU. As Timin is in the control path, we have d pimin(by Lemma 11) so T dimina.s.== Pa(Y d) is also required. Moreover, all of vertices in the segment A Timin ofd are chance nodes, because Ximin was defined as the first decision in d, and Timin precedes it. And, eachchance variable V d on the control path equals its parent Pa(V d) (by Definition 16), so Ad = T dimin, and thusAd a.s.== Pa(Y d) is required to attain the MEU.",
  ": Three graphs, with decisions in red, and a real-valued outcome Y . We write U(B) for a uniform distributionover B, i.e. a Bernoulli distribution with p = 0.5": "Any procedure for establishing immateriality based on the causal structure may be called a graphical crite-rion. For example, if a decision X is not an ancestor of the outcome Y , then all of the variables observed at Xare immaterial. An ideal graphical criterion would be proved complete, in that it can establish immaterialitywhenever this is possible from the graphical structure alone. Clearly, this criterion is not complete, becausein a, X is an ancestor of the outcome, but we still proved Z immaterial. So far, a graphical criterionfrom van Merwijk et al. (2022) has been proved complete, but only under some significant restrictions. Thecausal structure must be soluble, meaning that all of the important information observed from past decisionsis remembered at later decision points. Also, no criteria has been proved complete for identifying immaterialdecisions, i.e. past decisions that can be safely forgotten. For insoluble graphs, there is the criterion of Lee & Bareinboim (2020, Thm. 2), which can identify immaterialdecisions and is (strictly) more potent in general. However, it is not yet known whether this criterion iscomplete. In particular, it is not yet clear whether several of its conditions are necessary. For example, onecase where all existing criteria are silent is the simple graph shown in c we would like to knowwhether we can rule out X being a material observation for X. We cannot use van Merwijk et al. (2022)because X is a decision, and because the graph is insoluble.1 Furthermore, we cannot establish immaterialityusing Lee & Bareinboim (2020, Thm. 2), because it violates a property that we term LB-factorizability, whichwe will discuss in .4.2 1Formally, this is because W Y | X X, and X Y | X W, as per the definition of solubility that we will review in.2Specifically, requirement I of LB-factorizability is violated because Y is d-connected to X given X.",
  "Structural causal models": "A structural causal model (SCM) M is a tuple U, V , P(U), F, where U is a set of variables determinedby factors outside the model, called exogenous following a joint distribution P(U), and V is a set ofendogenous variables whose values are determined by a collection of functions F = {fV }V V such thatV fV (Pa(V ), UV ) where Pa(V ) V \\ {V } is a set of endogenous variables and UV U is a set ofexogenous variables. The observational distribution P(v) is defined as",
  "u": "V V P(v|paV , uV )P(u), whereuV is the assignment u restricted to variables UV . Furthermore, do(X = x) represents the operation offixing a set X to a constant x regardless of their original mechanisms. Such intervention induces a submodelMx, which is M with fX replaced by x for X X. Then, an interventional distribution P(v\\x| do(x)) canbe computed as the observational distribution in Mx. The induced graph of an SCM M is a DAG G ononly the endogenous variables V , where (i) XY if X is an argument of fY ; and (ii) XY if UX and UYmay be dependent, i.e. for any uX, uY , P(uX, uY ) = P(uX) P(uY ). We use the notation Pa(X), Ch(X), Anc(X) and Desc(X) to represent the parents, children, ancestors anddescendants of a variable X, respectively, and take ancestors and descendants to include the node X itself.3 We write V1 V2 to designate an edge whose direction may be V1 V2 or V1 V2. For a path V1 V,we will use the shorthand V1 --- V, and for a directed path V1 V, the shorthand V1 V. Fora path p : A --- B --- C --- D, we will describe the segment B --- C using the shorthand Bp--- C. Wewill use the shorthand V1:N for a sequence of variables V1, . . . VN indexed by 1, . . . , N, v1:N for a sequenceof assignments, and p1:N for a set of paths p1, . . . pN. 3Note that Pa(X) is an intentional reuse of the notation used to describe the arguments of fX in the SCM definition, becausethe endogenous arguments of fX and the parents of X in the induced graph are the same variables.",
  "Modelling decision problems": "To turn an SCM into a decision problem, three further elements must be specified: a set of decision variables,a set of policies that the agent may use to control those decision variables, and a goal that the agent is tryingto achieve. A Mixed Policy Scope (Lee & Bareinboim, 2020) supplies the first two elements: identifying certain variablesas decisions, and enumerating the context variables or observations CX on which each decision X is allowedto depend.",
  "A policy consists of a probability distribution for each decision X, conditional on its contexts CX": "Definition 2 (Mixed Policy). Given an SCM M and scope S = X, CX, a mixed policy (or a policy, forshort) contains for each X a decision rule X|CX, where X|CX : XX XCX is a proper probabilitymapping from the domain XX of X to the domain XCX of CX.4",
  "Given a mixed policy scope, we obtain a new causal structure, described by a scoped graph": "Definition 3 (Scoped graph). The scoped graph GS is obtained from G by replacing, for each decisionX X(S), all inbound edges to X with edges C X for every C CX. We only consider scopes for whichGS is acyclic. In a scoped graph, we will always illustrate the decision variables as red circles, as shown in (Lee& Bareinboim, 2020). The final element of a decision problem the agents goal will be represented bya real-valued variable Y . Throughout this paper, we will assume that Y is neither a decision, nor a context.",
  "The expected utility ,S given a policy is simply the expected value of Y in the model M, where eachfX is replaced with X, i.e. ,S := EM[Y ]. When the scope is obvious, we will simply write": "This paper is concerned with materiality whether removing one context variable from one decision willdecrease the expected utility attainable by the best policy. We define materiality in terms of the value ofinformation (Howard, 1990; Everitt et al., 2021). Definition 4 (Value of Information). Given an SCM M and scope S, the maximum expected utility (MEU)is S = maxS ,S.The value of information (VoI) of context Z CX for decision X X(S) isS SZX, where SZX is defined as X, CXXX(S)\\{X} X, CX \\ {Z}.",
  "The context Z is material for X in an SCM M if Z has strictly positive value of information for X, otherwiseit is immaterial": "4Following Lee & Bareinboim (2020), we term this a mixed policy due to its including mixed strategies. Note that gametheory also has a distinction between mixed policies, where the decision rules share a source of randomness, and behaviouralpolicies, where they do not, and in this sense, the mixed policies of Lee & Bareinboim (2020) are actually behavioural.",
  ": A graph where decisionsZ, X jointly determine the outcomeY .A policy node X is shown,which decides the decision rule at X": "If we know that a deterministic mixed policy is being followed, thenwe may deduce further conditional independence relations. This is be-cause conditioning on variables V may determine some decision vari-ables, which are called implied (Lee & Bareinboim, 2020), or func-tionally determined (Geiger & Pearl, 1990), making them conditionallyindependent of other variables in the graph. Definition 6 (Implied variables; Lee & Bareinboim, 2020). To obtainthe implied variables Z for variables Z in G given a mixed policy scopeS, begin with Z Z, then add to Z every decision X such thatCX Z, until convergence. For example, in , we see that X = {Z, X}, so Z is d-separatedfrom Y given X. This means that under a deterministic mixed policy, Z and Y are statistically independentgiven X. This has implications for materiality. In particular, it means that the best deterministic mixedpolicy Z = z, X = x does not need to observe Z at X. Moreover, the performance of the best deterministicmixed policy can never be surpassed by a stochastic policy (Lee & Bareinboim, 2020, Proposition 1), so Zis immaterial.",
  "Graphical criteria for materiality, and their applications": "Value of information was originally described separately from graphical models like the influence diagram(Howard, 1966). When influence diagrams were developed, however, knowing the value of information ofdifferent variables became a fundamental aspect of understanding an influence diagram (Shachter, 1986;Matheson, 1990; Howard & Matheson, 2005).Finding that a variable has zero value of information isespecially important because it narrows the search for an optimal policy. The property of having zero valueof information has since been termed immateriality (Shachter, 2016). Various past works have sought to establish the circumstances in which a variable could be proved immaterial.Sound criteria have been proposed by Fagiuoli & Zaffalon (1998); Lauritzen & Nilsson (2001); Shachter (2016).Furthermore, Fagiuoli & Zaffalon (1998) attempted to prove the criterions completeness, although it wasnot successful (Everitt et al., 2021).",
  "Single-decision settings": "In the single-decision setting, there is a sound and complete criterion for materiality: in a scoped graphG(S), there exists an SCM where the context Z CX is material if and only if Z Y | CX {X} \\ {Z}and the outcome Y is a descendant of X (Lee & Bareinboim, 2020; Everitt et al., 2021). The proofs of thesoundness (the only if direction) and completeness (the if direction) are both relevant to the current paper. The argument in the only if direction is that if X is not an ancestor of the outcome Y , then its policy iscompletely irrelevant to the expected utility, and so all of its contexts are immaterial, and if Z is conditionallyindependent of the outcome Y given the decision and other observations, then it may be safely ignoredwithout changing the expected utility of the policy. These conditions imply immateriality in the multi-decision setting for precisely the same reasons. The if direction is more important to us, because the result is extended by the present work. The if directionis proved by constructing a decision problem where Z is material. By assumption, there is a directed pathX Y , called the control path, and a path Z --- Y , active given CX {X} \\ {Z}, called the info path.The idea is to construct an SCM where the info path makes Z contain information about Y , and how Xought to influence Y , while the control path gives X a way to exert that influence. The construction from Everitt et al. (2021) and Lee & Bareinboim (2020) has two cases. When the info pathcontains no colliders, the construction is shown in a. In essence, the info path transmits a randomvalue V = v to PaY , and the decision has to match this value, i.e. X = V , in order to obtain the maximumutility of Y = 1. Without the context Z, the maximum expected utility is 0.5, proving materiality.5 For the case where the info path does contains a collider, the construction is shown in b. Eachfork Ui in the info path, along with Z, generates a random bit, while each collider Wi is assigned the XOR(Ui1 Ui) of its two parents. By observing z and the values w1:N, the agent has just enough informationto recover uN. In particular, the policy that sets X equal to the XOR of z and w1:N, obtains X = UN surelyand achieves the MEU, E[Y ] = 1. Without the context Z, the MEU becomes 0.5, so Z is material.",
  "Soluble multi-decision settings": "A decision problem is said to be soluble (or to have sufficient recall) if the decision-maker always remembersenough aspects of past decisions and observations to make the present decision optimally. Formally, thisrequires the graph to admit an ordering = X1, . . . , XN over decisions such that for every Xi, for everyprevious decision or context V {Xj CXj | j i}, we have V Anc(Y ) or V Y | {Xi} CXi. For 5To be precise, the formalism of Lee & Bareinboim (2020) also allows the active path from Z to include one or more bidirectededges V Y , but to deal with these cases, we begin with the distribution that we would use for a path V L Y , thenmarginalize out L.",
  "example, in a, using the ordering X X, the nodes Z, X are d-separated from Y by X and itscontexts {Z, Z, W}, which implies solubility": "For those graphs that satisfy this condition (corresponding to solubility), there exists a sound and completecriterion for evaluating materiality.As in the single-decision setting, an observation Z is identified asimmaterial if Z Y | CX {X} \\ {Z} where Y DescX. The only difference is that in the multi-decisionsetting, we can remove Z as a context of X and then repeat the process (i.e. the edge Z X is removedfrom the scoped graph GS) to find more immaterial contexts, until all immaterial observations have beenremoved. Conversely, when every such context has been removed in this way, then all remaining contextsmust be material. For example, in the graph of a, every decision is an ancestor of Y , and everycontext has an info path (the info paths include Z Y , Z W U Y , and W U Y ), so, allcontexts may be material in at least one decision problem with this causal structure, and in fact they arematerial in the SCM shown. It is useful to understand how the completeness direction of this result is proved, i.e. how the presence ofinfo paths is used to construct a decision problem where Z is material (van Merwijk et al., 2022, Theorem7). We can notice what obstacles arise by considering the graph from . If we were to apply thesingle-decision construction of Everitt et al. (2021) to this graph, we would first identify the info path Z Yand the control path X Z X Y . The info path has no colliders, so we would construct a decision",
  "If a decision X is a non-ancestor of Y , then its contexts are immaterial, If C Y | CX \\ {C}, then the context C is immaterial": "If either of these conditions describes the context Z that we are interested in, then we have proved itimmaterial, and our job is done. If neither of these conditions holds, then we can apply the more sophisticatedcriterion of Lee & Bareinboim (2020, Lemma 1) and Lee & Bareinboim (2020, Theorem 2). If the assumptionsof Lee & Bareinboim (2020, Lemma 1) hold for some target variables Z, target actions X, and latentvariables U , then they admit a factorization, which we term LB-factorizability, after the authors initials.Lee & Bareinboim (2020, Theorem 2) then contains some further assumptions; if these also hold, then thecontexts Z are immaterial to the decisions X. We begin with the definition of LB-factorizability. Definition 7. For a scoped graph GS, we will say that target actions X, endogenous variables Z disjointwith X, contexts C := CX \\ (X Z) and exogenous variables U are LB-factorizable if there exists anordering over V := C X Z such that:",
  "so Z and X are LB-factorizable": "In this paper, our focus is exclusively on the assumptions of Lee & Bareinboim (2020, Lemma 1) rather thanthe additional conditions of Lee & Bareinboim (2020, Theorem 2), but for completeness sake, the latter isreproduced in Appendix A. We also establish in Appendix A that the assumptions of Lee & Bareinboim(2020, Theorem 2) are indeed satisfied in the graph , meaning that Z is immaterial for X, matchingthe ad hoc analysis of this graph in .",
  "Theorem statement and proof overview": "The goal of this paper is to prove that condition (I) of LB-factorizability is necessary to establish immate-riality. More precisely, if condition (I) is unsatisfiable for all observations in the graph, then the graph iscompatible with materiality for all observations. It might initially seem unnecessarily stringent to assumethat this holds for all observations, rather than the context Z0 for which we are trying to prove materiality.Recall from b, however, that proofs of materiality are recursive, in that to prove that Z is materialfor X, we incentivized X to copy Z, and to do this, we had to incentivize X to pass on the value of Z. Thisrequired us to assume that other contexts and decisions (such as Z and X) have their own info paths andcontrol paths, not just Z and X. So that we can assume this, in our theorem below, condition (C) requiresthat (I) holds for all contexts. Conditions (A) and (B) are also necessary for a graph to be compatible withmateriality, because their negation implies immateriality, as discussed in .2.",
  "The materiality paths": "To prove materiality, we will begin by selecting info paths and a control path, similar to what was describedin .3 and illustrated in b. One difference, however, is that we must choose paths that allowus to prove the value of remembering a past decision. We will describe how to accommodate this differencein .2.1 then define the paths in .2.2.",
  "Paths for the value of remembering a decision": "Suppose that given the graph in , we would like to establish that it is useful to remember thedecision Z0, when making the decision X0. Given an info path, the procedures of Everitt et al. (2021) andvan Merwijk et al. (2022) will tell us how to construct an SCM, in which we can compute whether Z0 ismaterial. The problem is that there are two candidate info paths: Z0 Y and Z0 U Y , and theseprocedures give us no guidance on which one to choose. So which one will lead us to construct an SCMwhere Z0 is material? Let us consider each info path in turn. Using the info path Z0 Y , we obtain the model in a. In this model, we have Y = 1 if x0 = z0,i.e. the decision X0 is required to match the value of a past decision a. Then, the MEU of 1 can beachieved with a deterministic policy such as Z0 = 1, X0 = 1, and Z0 is immaterial for X0. To understandthis in terms of the paths involved, Why does the proof fail with this info path? It is because the the infopath Z0 Y includes no parents of Z0, so Z0 is implied by values outside the info path, and Z0 Y isrendered inactive given U. This means that observing Z0 can no longer provide useful information abouthow to maximize Y . Using the info path Z0 U Y , we obtain the model in b. In this model, Y = 1 if x0 = u, i.e.the decision X0 must match the value of a random Bernoulli variable U. The value of U is directly observedonly by Z0, and so in an optimal policy X0 must observe the decision z0; this is the case in the policyz0 = u, x0 = z0, and so Z0 is material for X0. The proof has succeeded because the info path Z0 U Yincludes a parent U of Z0, meaning that Z0 is no longer implied by variables outside the info path, and thepath Z0 U Y remains active given . This choice of path helps to ensure that Z0 provides usefulinformation about Y . In general, when an info path passes through a decision, such as Z0 in the previous example, we want it toalso pass through a non-decision parent of Z0. We will now see that condition (C) of Theorem 8 implies thateach decision has a non-decision parent N that is not in (X(S) CX(S)\\{Z}) \\ {Z}.",
  "Lemma 9.

If all of the parents of Z are decisions, then we would have Z X(S) \\ {Z}, and every pathwould be blocked, and condition (C) could not be true. Proof of Lemma 9.

From CZ (X(S)CX(S)\\{Z})\\{Z}, we deduce that Z (X(S)CX(S)\\{Z})\\{Z} (bythe definition of W ), and then there can be no active path from X to Y given (X(S)CX(S)\\{Z})\\{Z} CZ {Z}, contradicting condition (C) of Theorem 8, and proving the result.",
  "Defining the materiality paths": "In this subsection, we will describe how to select some paths to exhibit that some context Z0 is materialfor a decision X0. In overview, this will begin with the selection of a directed control path passing throughZ0 X0 and terminating at Y . There are finitely many info paths, which emanate from the control pathsand go to Y . Then finally, there are finitely many auxiliary paths, which go from colliders in the info pathsto Y . We will refer to the control, info, and auxiliary paths collectively as the materiality paths, and theycan all be seen in . The control path is the horizontal spine in . The control path exists because X0 is an ancestor ofY by condition (A) of Theorem 8, and X0 has a chance node ancestor A by Lemma 10 (because the parentZ0 of X0 is either a chance node, or it has a chance node parent.) We then index the decisions on the control path as Ximin, . . . , Ximax, and their parents along the control pathas Zimin, . . . , Zimax. where imin is either 0 (if Z0 is a chance node), or 1 (if Z0 = X1). (Note that wherethe control path has consecutive decisions, we will have Zi = Xi1.) Then, an info path mi is chosen foreach context Zi using Lemma 9 to ensure that it satisfies some desirable properties. Rather than the info path mi per se, we will often be interested in the portion of it that is non-overlappingwith the control path. So the intersection node Ti will essentially be the point at which the info path departsfrom the control path, and the truncated info path mi will be the segment Yi --- Y of mi.",

  "The materiality SCM": "We will now present a construction that uses the materiality paths to define an SCM where Z0 is materialfor X0.

  "Models for insoluble graphs": "To see how the past constructions of Everitt et al. (2021) and van Merwijk et al. (2022) need to be modified,it is instructive to consider some insoluble graphs that are allowed by Theorem 8, and examine how the pastconstructions fail to establish materiality. Consider, for example, the graph of a. This is insoluble, because at the decision X0, the past decisionX contains information about Y , i.e. X Y | Z0, and it also satisfies the three conditions of Theorem 8. In this graph, we can select the control path X0 Y and info path Z0 W1 U1 Y . Then, theconstruction from Everitt et al. (2021) and van Merwijk et al. (2022) could be applied if only X was anon-decision variable. So treat X as though it was a non-decision, and we obtain the decision problemshown in a. In this model, the outcome Y is equal to 1 when X0 is equal to U1. The idea of thisconstruction is that since W1 = Z0 Uq, the MEU is achieved with the non-intervened policy X0 = Z0 W1,which would require X0 to depend on Z0. In this model, however, X is a decision, and so there exists analternative optimal policy, where X = U1 and X0 = X, and X0 need not directly depend on Z0, provingthat Z0 is immaterial for X0. Essentially, the single bit of X suffices to transmit the value of U1, and sothe information contained in Z0 was not incrementally useful. So long as the decision problem allows X tocopy U1, Z0 will be immaterial. A potential remedy is to give U1 a larger domain than X, and this is the idea behind the modified construc-tion shown in b. In this scheme, two random bits are generated at U1. The outcome is Y = 1 if X1supplies one bit from U1 along with its index. A random bit is sampled at Z0, and W1 presents the Z0th bitfrom U1, while X1 has a domain of just one bit. Then, similar to our previous discussion of b, theonly bit from U1 that X0 can reliably know is the Z0th bit. Hence the only way to achieve the MEU is forX to inform X0 about the value of W1, and for X0 to equal X0 = Z0, X. Importantly, this can only bedone if X0 observes Z0, meaning that Z0 is material for X0. How might we generalize this construction to the case of c, where the info path has multiple forkvariables? Instead of just Z0 and U1, we now have J +1 fork variables U0:J, which sample bitstrings, each one2n as long as its predecessor. Each bitstring is then used to index its successor to obtain one bit. Formally,",
  ": Two SCMs (a-b), and a description of a family of SCMs, where each dashed line represents a path. Therepeated exponent expn2 (k) is defined as k if n = 0, and 2expn12(k) otherwise": "the observation is Z0 = U0, and at each collider Wi, we have Wi = Uj[Uj1]. If the decision X0 copies thevalues from Z0 and W1:J, we will say that it is consistent with u0:J. The outcome Y in this graph mustbe defined in terms of only X0 and UJ, so it cannot verify whether X0 = U0:J. What it can do, however, ischeck whether there exists any assignments U0:J1 that, taken with UJ would produce assignments z0, w1:Jthat X0 is consistent with. We term this latter property compatibility. Definition 12 (Consistency and compatibility). Let w = w0, w1, . . . , wJ where w0 Bk and wn B forn 1. Then, w is consistent with u = u0, . . . , uJ, ui Bexpi2(k) (i.e., w u) if w0 = u0 and wn = un[un1]for n 1. Moreover, w is compatible with uJ BexpJ2 (k) (i.e. w uJ) if there exists any u0, . . . , uJ1 suchthat w is consistent with u0, . . . , uJ. For example, in b, x1 is consistent with z0, u1 if x1 produces the z0th bit from u1, i.e. x1 =z0, u1[z0]. More leniently, we will say that x1 is compatible with z0, u1 if x1 produces any bit from u1,i.e. x1 = z0, u1[b] for any b. This means that either 0, 0 or 1, 1 is compatible with z0 = 0 and u1 = 01,but only the former is consistent with z0 = 0 and u1 = 00. The idea of the construction is that if the decision x0 is inconsistent with the fork assignments, then itwill also sometimes be incompatible with UJ, and therefore will be suboptimal. For example, in b,suppose that we have assignments z0 = 0 and u1 = 01 and a decision x = 1, 1. Then, given the assignmentsy0 = 0 and u1 = 00, we will have assignments z0 = 0 and w1 = 0, which will in turn cause the assignmentx = 1, 1 however, this is not consistent with z0 = 0 and u1 = 0, 0, so the utility will be y = 0. We nowprove that this is also true for the more general construction of c: if with strictly positive probability,the assignment of X0 is inconsistent with u0:J, then there will exist an alternative assignment U0:J = u0:J,that produces the same assignments to the observations of X0, but where X0 is incompatible with uJ. Lemma 13. Let w = w0, . . . , wJ and w = w0, . . . , wJ be sequences with w0, w0 Bk, wj, wj Bfor j 1, and let J J be the smallest integer such that wJ = wJ.Let u0, . . . , uJ be a sequencewhere uj[uj1] = wj for 1 j < J. Then, there exists some uJ+1, . . . , uJ such that w is consistent withu0, . . . , uJ, but w is incompatible with uJ.",
  "The proof is deferred to Appendix B.5": "We can then use this result to argue that Z0 is material in c. If Z0 is an observation of X0, thenwe achieve the MEU of 1 in the non-intervened model, where x0 is compatible with u0:J, and y = 1 surely.If instead Z0 is removed as an observation, then X0 cannot copy it, because Z0 is constructed to contain kbits, where k may be an arbitrarily large integer. It follows that x0 is sometimes inconsistent with u0:J, andhence sometimes compatible with uJ (by Lemma 13), so we will have y = 0 sometimes (by the definition ofY ), making the MEU less than 1. This argument will be fully formalized in .4.",
  "We will now define a construction for any graph containing the materiality paths described in Lemma 11": "In most respects, the construction is a slight evolution of previous examples. Where the truncated infopath mi is a directed path, the construction will generalize a, and the decision Xi will be taskedwith copying the value at an intersection node Ti. Where mi is not a directed path, the construction willgeneralize c, and Xi will be tasked with producing a bitstring that is compatible with forks Ui,1:Ji. For this more general construction, we do, still need to fix some notation. The first issue is that the materialitypaths may overlap. To accommodate this possibility, we will define a random variable V p for each variablein a materiality path p, then to derive the overall materiality SCM, we will define V as a Cartesian productover each V p. The sole exception is the outcome variable Y , which will be defined by a sum over every Y p.For any set of paths p, we define V p = ppV p.",
  "A second issue is that variables will often depend on their parents along the same path something thatwe can compactly describe as follows": "Definition 14 (Parents along paths). When a vertex V has a unique parent V along p, Pa(V p) = V p, andfor a set of paths p, let Pa(V p) = pp Pa(V p). For a collider V in a truncated info path mi : Ti --- Y ,let the parent nearer Ti along mi be PaL(V ), and the parent nearer Y be PaR(V ).",

  "Proving materiality in the materiality SCM": "We will now prove that in the materiality SCM, if Z0 is removed from the contexts of X0, then the perfor-mance for at least one of the utility variables Y mi is compromised, and so the MEU is not achieved. Theproof is divided into two cases, based on whether the child of X0 along the control path is a non-decision(.4.1) or a decision (.4.2).",

In this case, either X0 is the last decision in the control path, or otherwise there mustexist an intersection node T1, as shown in a. If the former is true, then it is immediate that thevalue x0 is transmitted to Y along the control path, based on the model definition. As such, Y0 can directlyevaluate the decision X0. For the latter case, we want an assurance that downstream decisions will passalong the value of X, as was the case in b. Such an assurance is provided by the following lemma,which states that whenever an intersection node Ti is a chance node (as T1 is) the value ti is transmittedto Y by every optimal policy.",

If in the materiality SCM, where Ti is a chance node,a policy has P (Pa(T pii ) = Pa(Y pi)) < 1, then P (Y mi < 1) > 0": "First, we prove the case where mi is a directed path. In this case, mi copies the value tpi to Y , which Y michecks against the value pa(ypi) received via the control path. Maximizing Y mi then requires them to beequal. Proof of Lemma 19 when mi is a directed path. We have fY mi(paY mi) = pa(Y mi) = pa(Y pi)) (Defini-tion 16).Also, Pa(Y mi) = T pii= Pa(T pii ) surely, where the first equality follows from Definition 16,",

Now, consider the intervention do(Ui,1:Ji = u1:Ji).Since Ti is a chance node, every collider in mi is a non-decision, and is assigned the (unique) value consistentwith pa(T pii ), u1:Ji. Furthermore, pa(T pii ), w1:Ji is consistent with pa(T pii ), u1:Ji, so the intervention doesnot affect the assignments to these colliders. Moreover, from Definition 16, no variable outside of mi isaffected by assignments within mi, except through the colliders. Therefore:",
  "P (Y mi = 0) > 0(P (ui,1:Ji) > 0)": "If mi is not a directed path, then we will require that the values pa(Y ri,1:Ji) are passed down the auxiliarypaths, not just the value pa(Y pi) from the control path. Specifically, pa(Y pi), pa(Y ri,1:Ji) must be consistentwith pa(Y pi), ui,1:Ji, where ui,1:Ji denotes the values of forks on the info path. Lemma 20 (Collider path requirement). If the materiality SCM has an info path mi that is not directed,and under the policy there are assignments Pa(Y pi,ri,1:Ji)=pa(Y pi,ri,1:Ji) to parents of the outcome, andU mii,1:Ji =umii,1:Ji to the forks of mi, with P (pa(Y pi,ri,1:Ji), umii,1:Ji) > 0 and where pa(Y pi,ri,1:Ji) is inconsistentwith pa(Y pi), umii,1:Ji, then P (Y mi < 1) > 0. The idea of the proof, similar to Lemma 19, is that whenever the bits transmitted along the auxiliary pathsdeviate from the values wi,1:Ji of colliders in mi, there exists an assignment ui,1:Ji to forks in mi thatwill render the colliders, and hence the decision xi unchanged, while making xi incompatible with uJi, andthereby producing Y mi < 0. A detailed proof is in Appendix B.5. Before we prove that Z0 is material in this case, we require one more intermediate result: that Z0 cannotbe chosen deterministically, if it is a decision. The idea will be that random information is generated at A,which each of the decisions, including Z0, is required to pass along the control path; we can prove this as acorollary of Lemma 19.",
  "We can now combine our previous results to prove that it is impossible to achieve the MEU, if Z0 is not acontext of X0, in the case where T1 does not exist, or is a non-decision": "Lemma 22 (Required properties unachievable if child is a non-decision). Let M be a materiality SCMwhere the child of X0 along d is a non-decision. Then, the MEU for the scope S cannot be achieved by adeterministic policy in the scope SZ0X0 (equal to S, except that Z0 is removed from CX0). The logic is that if child of X0 in the control path is a non-decision, then the value of X0 is copied all theway to Pa(Y d) (Lemma 21). Furthermore, Zd0a.s.== Pa(Y d) is necessary to achieve the MEU (Lemma 19).But the materiality SCM has been constructed so that the non-Z0 parents of X0 do not contain enoughbits to transmit all of the information about Zd0, so the MEU cannot be achieved. The proof is detailed inAppendix B.6.",
  "Case 2: child of X0 along d is a decision": "We will now prove that if, as shown in b, the child of X0 along d is a decision and the decision Z0is not available as a context of X0, then E[Y1] < 1. The overall argument will be that if X0 cannot observeZ0, then it cannot convey the value of U1,1 to the child X1, and so X1 will not be able to be consistent withu0:J1. Our first lemma will state that if a decision Xi1 does not distinguish Ui,1, and Ui,2 is a bitstring whereinall of the digits are the same, then Ui,1 cannot influence Y , other contexts of Ti, colliders Wi,1:Ji, or forksUi,2:Ji. A couple of details of this lemma are worth remarking upon. First, it assumes that Ti = Xi1 something that is always true for i = 1 in the case that Z1 = X0. Second, it assumes that Ti is adeterministic decision rule, which will simplify the proofs without importantly weakening it, because everydecision problem has a deterministic policy that performs as well as the best non-deterministic policy.",
  "then P (Y mi < 1) > 0": "The idea of the proof is that if ui,1 and ui,1 differ, there will be some assignment pa(Y pi) such thatui,1[pa(Y pi)] and ui,1[pa(Y pi)] differ. When Pa(Y pi) = pa(Y pi) and Ui,1 = ui,1, then Pa(Y ri,1) will as-sume one value.But if we intervene ui,1, ui,2:Ji, then the value of Pa(Y ri,1) will be incorrect, makingPa(Y pi,ri,1:Ji) inconsistent with Pa(Y pi, Ui,1:Ji) so the maximum expected utility is impossible to achieve.The details are deferred to Appendix B.8.",
  "This allows us to prove that when the child of X0 along d is a decision, the MEU cannot be achieved unlessZ0 is a context of X0": "Lemma 25 (Required properties unachievable if child is a decision). Let M be the materiality SCM forsome scoped graph GS, where imax > 0 and T1 is a decision. Then, there exists no deterministic policy inthe scope SZ0X0 that achieves the MEU. To prove that no deterministic policy in SZ0X0 can achieve the MEU (achievable with the scope S), wewill show that if a deterministic policy satisfies P (Pa(Y d) = Ad) = 1, as required by Lemma 21, thenthe domain of X0 Cm1X0is smaller than the domain of Cm1X0 , so Equation () will be satisfied, and thus theMEU cannot be achieved. A detailed proof is presented in Appendix C.",
  "We now combine Lemmas 22 and 25 to prove the main result": "Proof of Theorem 8. Any scoped graph G(S) that satisfies conditions (A-C) contains materiality paths forthe context Z0 of X0 (Lemma 11), and has a materiality SCM (Definition 16) compatible with G(S). In thisdecision problem, whether the child of X0 along d is or is not a decision, the MEU cannot be achieved by adeterministic policy unless X0 is allowed to depend on Z0 (Lemmas 22 and 25). And stochastic policies cannever surpass the best deterministic policy (Lee & Bareinboim, 2020, Proposition 1), so no such policy canachieve the MEU, and therefore Z0 is material for X0.",
  "Toward a more general proof of materiality": "So far, via Theorem 8, we have established the necessity of condition (I) of LB-factorizability for immateri-ality. We now outline some steps toward evaluating the necessity of conditions (II-III) of LB-factorizability,as well as the further condition in (Lee & Bareinboim, 2020, Thm. 2). It is trivial to satisfy either one of (II-III) in isolation. Condition (III) merely requires that we choose anordering such that the parents of each decision X are prior to X, while the descendants come afterwards,and such an ordering clearly exists in any acyclic graph. Condition (II) can also be satisfied by placing allof the variables in C at the start of the ordering . However, there does not always exist an ordering that satisfies (II-III) simultaneously. Indeed, wheneverthere does not, we will be able to prove the existence of some info paths and control paths. If we could usethese paths to establish materiality, then we would have proved that (II-III) are necessary conditions. Sofar, however, we have only been able to carry out the first step defining the paths and difficulties havearisen in using those paths to define an SCM that exhibits materiality. In this section, we will outline whatinfo paths and control paths can be proven to exist, and then outline the difficulties in using them to provemateriality.",
  "a control path d : X C where X X": "A proof is supplied in Appendix D.1. The intuition of this proof is that each of the conditions (I-III) impliesa precedence relation between a pair of variables in V Y . Each of these precedence relations can be usedto build an ordering graph over V Y . If the ordering graph is acyclic, then we can let be any orderingthat is topological on the graph, and then Z, X, C, U are LB-factorizable. Otherwise, we can use a cyclein the graph to prove the existence of an info path and a control path. By iterating over these cycles, wecan obtain a series of info paths and control paths that terminate at Y . The resulting paths are in some cases quite useful for proving materiality. For instance, we can recover thepair of info and control paths used in b. To prove that Z is material for X, we can start by choosingX = {X, X}, C = {Z, W}, and U = . Then, Lemma 26 implies the existence of an active path from Zto some DescX C, so we see that the first info path is the edge Z Y . Since Y is a descendant of X,we also have the first control path, X Z X Y . We must then obtain some paths that exhibit whyZ is itself useful for the decision X to know about, and to influence. To do this, we can reapply Lemma 26using the sets X = {X, X}, Z = {Z}, C = {Z, W}, and U = . We then obtain the new info pathZ W U Y , and the new control path X Y . The SCM in b uses these paths to prove Zis material for X.",
  "A further challenge: non-collider contexts": "In some graphs, it is not clear how to use the info and control paths from Lemma 26 to prove materiality,because non-collider nodes on the info path may be contexts. (In previous work, this possibility was excludedby the solubility assumption (van Merwijk et al., 2022, Lemma 28).) We will now highlight one case, in, where it is relatively clear how this challenge can be overcome, and one case, , where itis unclear how to make progress. In the graph of , we would like to prove that Z0 is material for X0. Using Lemma 26, we can obtainthe red and blue info paths as shown, and the corresponding control paths, shown in darker versions of thesame colours. The usual idea of Definition 16, shown in a, would be that X0 must observe Z0 inorder to know which slice from V is presented at its parent X1. In this model, X1 would play two roles,one for the red info path, and one for the dark blue control path. As a collider on the red info path, its roleis to present the Zth0bit from V . As the initial endpoint of the blue control path, its role is to copy theassignment of Z0. The problem, however, is that X0 then does not need to observe Z0 in order to reproduceits value, because this value is already observed at X1, and so Z0 is not material. To remedy this problem, we can construct an alternative SCM, where the value of Z0 is concealed, i.e.it is removed from the other contexts, CZ0 \\ Z0. We now define X1 as V [Z0] (i.e. we have removed Z0),leaving the decision X1 with a domain of only one bit. At C, we impose some random noise; that is C isnot always a perfect copy of Z0. The result is shown in b. When this model is not intervened, anexpected utility of E[Y ] = 10.99 is achieved, because the red term in Y always equals 10, while the blue termhas an expectation of 0.99. (This is the MEU, because there is no way to improve the blue term to haveexpectation 1 without decreasing the expectation of the red term by at least 0.05.) If instead Z0 is removedas a context for X0, then the expected utility can only be as high as E[Y ] = 10.95. To understand this, werestrict our attention to deterministic policies, and note that in order for the red term to be better than acoin flip (with an expected value of 5), we would either need to have X0 = C, X1 and the red term willhave an expectation of 9.95, or we must have X1 = V and X0 = 0, X1 and then the blue term willhave an expectation of 0.5. In either case, performance is worse than 10.99, so Z0 is material for X0. The problem is that concealing the value of Z0 does not work for all graphs. To see this, let us add twodecisions, X2 and X3, to the graph from , to thereby obtain the graph in . Let us retainthe materiality SCM from b, except that X2 and X3 copy the value from C along to Y . One mightexpect that Z0 should still be material, but it is not. Now, there is a policy that achieves the new MEU of 11by superimposing the value of Z0 on the assignments of decisions X2 and X3. In this policy , x1 = v[z0],x2 = z0 z0, x3 = x2 z0, and x0 = x2 x3 = z0 where represents the XOR function. Under , the red",
  "term equals 10 surely, while the blue term equals 1 surely, i.e. the MEU is achieved, and is a valid policyeven if Z0 is not a context of X0, meaning that Z0 is not material for X0": "In summary, whenever Z Z0, X X0, C, U are not LB-factorizable, then we can find some info andcontrol paths for Z0 and X0, but then X0 can recover the value of Z0, making it possible to achieve theMEU even when Z0 is removed as a context of X0. In some graphs, we can devise an alternative SCM thatconceals the value of Z0. But in others, a policy can superimpose the information from Z0 on other decisions,such as X2 and X3 in , so that X0 can recover the value of Z0, making Z0 immaterial for X0 onceagain. Overall, in order to establish a complete criterion for materiality, we would need some new method to preventthe information from Z0 from being superimposed on other decisions. So, in order for future work to achievethis goal, we predict that it will have to make further modifications to the construction from Definition 16.",
  "Conclusion": "In graphical models of decision-making, a key challenge is to ascertain which variables can be deemedimmaterial based on the graphical structure alone. This problem is a long-standing one, a solution to whichcould allow influence diagrams to be solved more efficiently, and aid in analyzing the safety and fairness ofAI systems. A key condition for establishing immateriality is LB-factorizability. We have found that if nocontext can satisfy condition (I) of LB-factorizability, then any context is material in at least one decision",
  "if, as in , the variable Zi whose materiality we are trying to establish is a decision, then wemust choose an info path so that the value of Zi cannot be determined by other contexts;": "if, as in , the info path begins with a variable Z0 that is a context not just of the targetdecision X0, but also some other decision X, then we must construct the decision problem so thatX cannot copy Z0 in its entirety; if, as in .4.2, the control path contains consecutive decisions, then we give large domains tothe source A, and all of the variables on the control path, so that this information can only possiblybe copied by these decisions. As a next step towards establishing a complete criterion for materiality, we then considered the more generalsetting where no context can jointly satisfy conditions (I-III) of LB-factorizability. In this setting, we haveidentified info paths and control paths that appear useful for proofs of materiality, and we can apply anadjusted version of our construction to this case. However, in some settings there are ways for optimalperformance to be achieved even when Z0 is not a context of X0, and so we have not yet found a successfulproof of materiality in this more general setting."
