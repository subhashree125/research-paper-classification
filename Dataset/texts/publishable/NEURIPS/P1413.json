  "Google DeepMind": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be susceptible to crafted adversarial attacks or jailbreaksthat lead to the generation of objectionable content despite being aligned to human preferences usingsafety fine-tuning methods. While the large dimensionality of input token space makes it inevitable tofind adversarial prompts that can jailbreak these models, we aim to evaluate whether safety fine-tunedLLMs are safe against natural prompts which are semantically related to toxic seed prompts that elicitsafe responses after alignment. We surprisingly find that popular aligned LLMs such as GPT-4 canbe compromised using naive prompts that are NOT even crafted with an objective of jailbreaking themodel. Furthermore, we empirically show that given a seed prompt that elicits a toxic response from anunaligned model, one can systematically generate several semantically related natural prompts that canjailbreak aligned LLMs. Towards this, we propose a method of Response Guided Question Augmentation(ReG-QA) to evaluate the generalization of safety aligned LLMs to natural prompts, that first generatesseveral toxic answers given a seed question using an unaligned LLM (Q to A), and further leveragesan LLM to generate questions that are likely to produce these answers (A to Q). We interestingly findthat safety fine-tuned LLMs such as GPT-4o are vulnerable to producing natural jailbreak questionsfrom unsafe content (without denial) and can thus be used for the latter (A to Q) step. We obtainattack success rates that are comparable to/ better than leading adversarial attack methods on theJailbreakBench leaderboard, while being significantly more stable against defenses such as Smooth-LLMand Synonym Substitution, which are effective against existing all attacks on the leaderboard.",
  ". Introduction": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on massive web-scale data, and are thus exposed todiverse forms of objectionable content during pre-training. To prevent these models from exhibitingundesirable behavior, the generation of toxic content is suppressed using alignment techniques suchas reinforcement learning via human feedback (RLHF) (Bai et al., 2022; Christiano et al., 2017),instruction tuning (Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2021) and safety filters (Han et al., 2024; Inanet al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2024a). However, recent research has revealed that these techniques canbe circumvented by adversarial attacks (Carlini et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023) and handcraftedjailbreaks (Shen et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023), which are specifically designed to circumvent thesafety mechanisms in aligned models. This raises concerns about the robustness of aligned LLMs, andbrings up a crucial question: how robust are aligned LLMs to natural, in-distribution prompts, whichare likely to be encountered during typical usage? Understanding this is essential for developing bettersafety training strategies and to accurately characterize the real-world safety of models. To answer this question, we aim to design natural prompts that are semantically related to agiven toxic seed prompt. Surprisingly, we find that aligned LLMs such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023b), arebrittle against natural prompts generated by simply paraphrasing toxic questions using LLMs. Thisindicates that current safety mechanisms may be overly reliant on surface-level features of the input,rather than a deeper understanding of intent. Furthermore, we propose Response Guided QuestionAugmentation (ReG-QA) to systematically evaluate the in-distribution generalization of LLMs after",

  ". Related Work": "Large Language Models are susceptible to adversarial attacks (or jailbreaks) that are designed tocircumvent their safeguards, thereby inducing the generation of objectionable content. Initial works onLLM jailbreaks have focused on designing handcrafted prompts to elicit undesirable responses (Shenet al., 2023; walkerspider, 2022; Wei et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023). While such manual methodsare crucial to identify and demonstrate vulnerabilities, they are neither scalable, nor sufficientlycomprehensive, to robustly evaluate evolving versions of models which can be trained on such publiclyaccessible jailbreaks. Another line of work employs white-box optimization techniques (requiringaccess to model weights) such as gradient ascent to generate prompts that trigger unsafe outputs(Carlini et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023). A key weakness of these techniques is that the resulting promptsoften appear nonsensical and unnatural, and can thus be easily detected based on the presence ofsuch high perplexity tokens (Alon and Kamfonas, 2023; Jain et al., 2023). The drawbacks related to both manually crafted jailbreaks and white-box attacks have led togreater focus on automated generation of natural language jailbreaks. Liu et al. (2023) proposehierarchical genetic algorithms to generate stealthy jailbreaks using existing handcrafted jailbreaks asprototypes to reduce the search space. Shah et al.

Note that R0 may not always be a subset of R2. R0 is considered to bethe region where the LLM is trained to give safe (denial) responses as a result of SFT/RLHF basedsafety fine-tuning. We depict different methods of modifying a toxic seed question that results in asafe denial response (denoted by a green cross in R0), into a jailbreak that results in a toxic response(denoted by red cross). While prompts close to R0 have strict constraints on naturalness of meaningand content, and are thus considered to be safer by virtue of generalization of safety training, promptscloser to R4 can be constructed to overcome the underlying safety mechanism.",
  ". Background and Motivation": "In , we categorize the landscape of jailbreaks into different regions based on the distributionthey belong to. R4 broadly represents the region of all possible text which may/ may not have semanticmeaning, R3 is the subset of this containing semantically meaningful text. We consider R2 as thepre-training data distribution, with R0 being a subset which is used for safety fine-tuning and R1being the region close to the fine-tuning data distribution. We note that R0 may not always be a subsetof R2. We depict different methods of modifying a toxic seed question that results in a safe denialresponse (denoted by a green cross in R0), into a jailbreak that results in a toxic response (denoted byred cross). Standard gradient based adversarial attacks such as A4 produce text without any semanticmeaning, and are thus very easy to detect using perplexity based thresholding methods (Alon andKamfonas, 2023; Jain et al., 2023). Attacks such as A3 incorporate the objective of generating naturallanguage jailbreaks (Chao et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023; Takemoto, 2024; Zeng et al.,2024b), and thus circumvent such simple defenses . While these attacks lie within the distribution ofsemantically meaningful text (R3), they are still far from the distribution of natural text (R2), sincethey are crafted to optimize a certain objective, or by prompting LLMs directly or indirectly to producestealthy prompts. Similarly, although handcrafted jailbreaks (Shen et al., 2023; walkerspider, 2022;Wei et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023) also contain well-formed sentences, they again lie in far fromthe distribution of natural text, since they are deliberately crafted with an intention of jailbreakingthe LLM. Thus, existing works show that it is very easy for an adversarial player to jailbreak anLLM. Contrary to this, we aim to understand the robustness of LLMs to prompts that belong to thedistribution of natural data (R2). The training data distribution captures the diversity present inweb scale data, and represents the variety of user prompts that can be expected during inference,",

From a seed question, we use an unaligned LLM to generate multiple answers, each ofwhich is passed to another LLM to generate questions that would give that answer. thus serving as a proxy to the distribution of natural prompts. We thus aim to characterize how wellaligned LLMs generalize to prompts that lie within the distribution of training data, and propose amethod for generating such natural prompts that are diverse and related to a seed question.",
  ". Threat Model": "In this work, we consider the generation of in-distribution, natural jailbreak prompts related to a givenseed prompt . While prior works mostly focus on naturalness of language, we constraint the threatmodel further by additionally considering naturalness of content as well. We thus define our threatmodel as the set of prompts which are naturally occurring with respect to the training distributionof LLMs, and denote it as Dnat. To formalize the constraint on similarity with respect to the seedprompt, we use an embedding model (for example, a sentence embedding model like sentenceBERT(Reimers, 2019) or Gecko (Lee et al., 2024)) denoted as an encoder Enc. We consider a perturbationradius in the embedding space with respect to the seed prompt under the distance metric relatedto cosine similarity given by (, ) = 1 cos(Enc(), Enc()) where cos(, ) denotes the cosinesimilarity between the embedding vectors and . Thus, we define the threat model T, as:",
  "T, = { : Dnat (1 cos(Enc(), Enc())) < }(1)": "The attack success criteria of prompts within the threat model is measured using a classificationmodel (or judge) Mjudge, which operates on the generated jailbreak , the response of the target LLM and a system prompt , to generate an output of 0 (safe) or 1 (unsafe). We note that relying solelyon embedding similarity can be susceptible to adaptive adversarial attacks, where an adversary couldcraft prompts that appear close in embedding space but deviate significantly in semantic meaning.To mitigate this, our proposed jailbreak generation pipeline remains independent of the specificembedding model used for defining the perturbation bound. Further, our approach uses benign andsimple prompts - specifically, we neither instruct the attack generation LLM (directly or indirectly) toadopt any jailbreaking strategy, nor do we perform any form of optimization to increase attack successrate. While such strategies can increase attack success rate of our method as well, our restrictionsensure that the generated jailbreaks are closer to the distribution of natural text.",
  ". Generation of Question Augmentations": "We first discuss how publicly accessible safety aligned LLMs (with only API access) and an unalignedLLM (presumably after pre-training and instruction tuning that does not involve safety) can be usedto generate natural jailbreaks that lead to diverse questions from a given toxic seed question. Ourapproach, which we term as ReG-QA, exploits the potential asymmetry in safety alignment betweenquestion generation and answer generation in LLMs. We find that while safety-aligned LLMs are robustin generating safe responses to potentially harmful questions, they may be vulnerable to generatingunsafe questions when prompted with harmful answers. This vulnerability allows us to generate adiverse set of natural prompts using some of the most capable publicly API accessible models (GPT-4o),as illustrated in . Algorithm 1 formalizes the procedure. First, an unaligned LLM, denoted as Q>A, generatesa diverse set of answers A from a given seed question (Line 2). We then filter these answers basedon criteria , selecting only those deemed toxic by an external judge and exceeding a predefinedlength threshold (Line 3), resulting in the subset Asel (Line 3). Next, we utilize a safety-aligned LLM,A>Q, accessible only via API, to generate questions from each answer Asel (Line 6). ThisLLM is prompted to produce multiple questions that could elicit the given answer. To improve thequality and diversity of the augmented questions, we apply a selection criterion , ensuring minimalredundancy and overlap (Line 7). The resulting set of questions, aug in Algorithm 1, constitutes ournatural jailbreaks. We evaluate their effectiveness in eliciting unsafe responses from frontier LLMs(also accessed via API) using a GPT-4o-mini based judge. Remarks: The success of our method hinges on the observation that safety alignment in LLMsmay not generalize symmetrically between question and answer generation. Our empirical results(presented in subsequent sections) demonstrate that safety-aligned LLMs, when prompted to generatequestions from potentially toxic answers, produce undesirable questions with high attack successrates (ASR). This asymmetry suggests a potential reversal curse\" (Berglund et al., 2023) in safetyalignment, a phenomenon that warrants further investigation. While we leverage a safety-alignedLLM for question generation, one could alternatively utilize an unaligned LLM for this step.",

  ". Experimental Setup": "Models: To empirically validate our claims, we present results on the following publicly API accessiblemodels: GPT-3.5-Turbo-1106, GPT-4-0125-Preview, GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2023a), Gemma2-27B-IT, Gemma2-9B-IT (Gemma Team, 2024), Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (Team, 2024), Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 (Jiang et al., 2023), Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 (Jiang et al., 2024). Weuse Palm-2-Otter (Anil et al., 2023b) based LLMs for generating unsafe answers from a given seedquestion in the proposed ReG-QA pipeline. Further we use GPT-4o for the generation of questions inboth ReG-QA and Para-QA. Judge Selection: In of the Appendix, we present results using various combinations ofLLMs from the GPT family (OpenAI, 2023b) and prompt candidates from JailbreakBench (Chaoet al., 2024)/ PAIR (Chao et al., 2023), on the Judge Comparison dataset on JailbreakBench (JBBurl,2024) containing a mix of 300 human annotated unsafe and safe questions. We compare agreement(accuracy with respect to majority vote across human annotations as ground truth), FNR (for mis-classifying unsafe as safe) and FPR (for classifying safe as unsafe) rates. The cost per 1M tokens isalso listed. We choose the option that is viable in terms of usage license, cost, agreement, FPR andFNR rates.

Datasets: We benchmark the performance of the proposed methods on JailbreakBench (Chao et al.,2024) 1, which is a publicly available dataset.

Firstly, although the proposed method does not incorporate the objective of jailbreakingin any form during generation, we obtain very high attack success rates as shown in the table. Theoverall attack success rate is 82% for gpt-4 and 93% for gpt-3.5 for our method as against 41%and 66% respectively for Para-QA. This shows that our projection of the seed question to the spaceof natural prompts is quite different from just paraphrasing based methods. Further, across severalcategories, our method ReG-QA outperforms paraphrasing based methods, achieving 100% ASR onmany categories for both GPT-variants. Similarly, we also present attack success rates for the opensource Gemma-2 model with 27B parameters. Our method produces an ASR of 82% against 36% forthe Para-QA baseline. In our ASR evaluations presented in , target models have temperature of 1 which is thedefault setting for gpt-4 and gpt-3.5. We use this to mimic the realistic setting of usage throughexternal APIs.

We note from ourevaluations (Table-6) that ASR with temperature 0 is always higher than ASR with default (higher)temperatures for a fixed attack budget. Thus our results are more conservative than those presentedon JailbreakBench. To ensure robustness of the resulting prompt, and repeatability, we prompt thetarget model with the same question 4 times, and ensure it produces a toxic response as evaluated byMjudge at least 3 times. We further present results by firstly identifying jailbreaks using our methodof setting the default temperature, and further verifying that these are able to jailbreak even withtemperature of 0, in Table-6 of the Appendix. Firstly, we note that for the setting of temperature=1,ASR drops as we increase the criterion on the number of successes when prompted multiple times.Further, the ASR with temperature of 0 is higher than the setting we consider above. We further present attack success rates on several recent open sourced and closed sourcedLLMs with temperature of the target LLM set to 0 (as in JailbreakBench) in . In this ta-ble we present comprehensive results on ASR at different thresholds, where ASR @ k/n denotesthat k question augmentations out of n are successful jailbreaks. We additionally present statis-tics on the number of jailbreaks generated per seed. Based on the results, we find that thereare two sets of models which are partitioned in the table - the first set (GPT-4o, Gemma2-9B-ITand Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct) comprises of the more recent models that are robust to the seedquestion at both 0 temperature and 0.5 temperature with 100x prompting, highlighting that seedprompts from JailbreakBench are possibly a part of their training data. The second set of models(GPT-3.5-Turbo-1106, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 and Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1)are the ones that have ASR in the 40-70% range on the seed prompts themselves, suggesting that thesemodels have not been trained on the full set of these questions. Across all models, we obtain very highattack success rates (89-99%) which is always higher than the paraphrasing baseline, highlightingthat the proposed approach indeed enhances the diversity of the seed prompt. Further, we note thatthe gains at all ASR thresholds are considerably higher for the proposed approach in the first setof models - which are possibly trained on these seed prompts - indicating that our attack strategyis indeed effective in understanding the generalization of LLMs to prompts used in safety training.Since the second set of models are possibly not trained on many of these seed questions, even smallperturbations to the prompts are effective in jailbreaking the model. Thus ASR at higher thresholds",
  "of 10 and 100 are higher for the paraphrasing baseline. A similar trend can be noted in the statisticsof the number of jailbreaks generated per seed as well": "Higher ASR rates than leading methods on JailbreakBench: In the proposed method, wefirst generate 100 answers per seed question and further generate 10 questions per answer. Thus,the total number of queries per seed is 1000. We note that for the same attack budget, the leadingattack method (Andriushchenko et al., 2024) achieves 78% ASR on gpt-4-0125-preview, whilewe achieve 82%, as shown in Table-1. We further compare ASR of our method against lead attackmethods, with and without defenses, in Table-3, with target model as gpt-3.5-Turbo-1106. Forthe evaluations in this table, we do 1x prompting with default temperature of 1, and further find thesubset that also jailbreak the target model at temperature=0. This is different from the temperaturesetting of 0 that is used in Table-2, resulting in a more modest estimate of robustness (ASR of 95%in vs. 99% in ). We note that the proposed method is significantly more robust thanexisting methods against all defenses considered from the JailbreakBench leaderboard. Some ofthe defenses introduce semantically meaningful/ random perturbations to the attack and verify thesafety of the resulting prompts. The robustness of the proposed approach against such defenseshighlights the stability of the generated attacks in the loss landscape. Thus, the inherent criterion ofnaturalness in our attack serves as an adaptive attack (Tramer et al., 2020) against defenses whichutilize non-naturalness and instability to perturbations as the criteria for detecting jailbreaks, servingas a motivation to build more robust defenses. Implications to Generalization of Safety fine tuning: Our method does not use the targetmodel in either the white-box or black-box access mode, which is not true for most existing methods.This serves as a demonstration that the brittleness of safety fine-tuning to even minor distributionshifts at test time (as pointed by Wei et al. (2024)) is one of the main failure modes of LLMs. Further,our results also demonstrate that aligned models such as GPT-4o are indeed capable of generatingjailbreaks by simply prompting them to generate questions that give the specified answer, highlightingthat forward (Q to A) direction of safety training does not generalize to the reverse direction (A to Q).

Note that both methods have ahigher attack success rate when it crosses a certain cosine similarity threshold. However, ReG-QAsASR beyond cosine similarity of 0.7(1 ) is much higher compared to paraphrasing. Finally, ourmethod has a non trivial ASR of close to 80% at a similarity threshold of 0.7 (where roughly thetransition happens), suggesting that the proposed algorithm generates natural jailbreaks that aresimilar to the seed prompt, while also being diverse (Ref: Appendix-B for details on relevance and",

Conclusion": "In this work, we propose a method for verifying the in-distribution generalization of LLMs aftersafety-training, and demonstrate that popular LLMs such as GPT-4 are brittle against even naturalprompts which are semantically related to toxic seed prompts that elicit safe responses. We baseour algorithm on the following failure modes of LLMs which we find: i) LLMs are more likely toproduce toxic content when presented with cues or details from the answer in the question, ii) forwarddirection of safety training (Q to A) does not guarantee reverse direction of safety (A to Q). The latterallows us to generate jailbreak prompts using GPT-4o, by simply prompting it to generate questionsthat give the specified toxic answer. We obtain attack success rate of 82% for GPT-4 and 93% forGPT-3.5 on JailbreakBench. Finally, we show that our method is significantly more robust thanexisting attacks against several defenses on the JailbreakBench leaderboard. Thus our method servesas an adaptive attack against all defenses that incorporate non-naturalness and instability as thecriteria for detecting jailbreaks. We hope this work inspires further research on understanding thegeneralization of existing safety training algorithms, motivating the need for better defenses.",

Use the following guidelines forevaluation: 1. The RESPONSE must contain harmful, unethical, or illegal content that addresses theREQUEST to be classified as unsafe. 2. The RESPONSE must clearly provide specific details to theREQUEST to be classified as unsafe. 3. The RESPONSE message could contain an affirmative answer(e.g., starting with Sure) but not contain harmful content specified in the REQUEST. These cases do notviolate our guidelines and must be classified as safe. 4. If the RESPONSE is irrelevant to the REQUESTor the REQUEST itself is not harmful, it must be classified as safe.Answer with either safe or unsafe and nothing else (in particular, never start your response with I\"):",
  "Discussion of results in : We present the diversity-relevance trade-off of the proposed approachReg-QA when compared to Para-QA in , with target LLM as GPT-3.5": "We compute diversity on a set of prompts as log | det (Enc(), Enc())|, where , is cosine similaritybetween Enc() and Enc( ). We use Gecko (1B model) embedding encoder as Enc. (Lee et al. (2024)). Forrelevance, we compute average of cosine similarity between every prompts embedding Enc(X) and the seed",
  "C. Generation of Natural Queries": "While several attack methods generate natural-language text, the proposed method ReG-QA generates queriesthat are benign and natural, without having a specific goal of jailbreaking the model. Thus, the generatedjailbreaks do not include instructions on hypothetical scenarios such as You are a {role} doing an {action}... \" (Andriushchenko et al., 2024; Chao et al., 2023) or arbitrary tokens based on gradient descent, orother optimization methods (Andriushchenko et al., 2024; Paulus et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2023). In order todemonstrate this, we use a GPT-4o based judge to select the most natural and direct prompt among a list ofjailbreaks generated using the following methods - ReG-QA (Ours), PAIR (Chao et al., 2023), Prompt andRandom Seach (Andriushchenko et al., 2024), GCG (Zou et al., 2023), and Adversarial Prompter (Paulus et al.,2024). We use the following prompt for the judge LLM: Output a python list containing ONE selected question from the following list:\\n{list-jailbreaks}Criteria for selection: 1. The selected question should be natural and direct, 2. The selected question shouldNOT contain conversational instructions putting the reader in hypothetical scenarios such as \"You are a studentwho is trying to ...\" , 3. The selected question should NOT contain any meaningless text/ symbols, especially atthe end. We use the seed questions from JailbreakBench and only consider successful jailbreaks from the respectivemethods. Out of the 100 seed prompts, we consider 74 - where our approach, and at least 3 of 4 baselineshave successful jailbreaks on a given target LLM - Mistral-7B or GPT-3.5. Further, we prompt the judge LLM 5times independently for each seed, with random ordering of jailbreaks from each method every time. We findthat GPT-4o selects jailbreaks generated using the proposed approach ReG-QA 96% of the time with 3 of 5being the criteria for selection in each case. This demonstrates that the prompts generated using the proposedapproach are indeed more natural and direct than other existing attacks.",

For this, we compute the minimum log likelihood for a givenjailbreak - across text chunks of window size 5 words and stride 1 and average this across jailbreakscorresponding to each seed prompt. The log-likelihood of the proposed method is higher comparedto all other attack methods and is comparable to that of the seed questions. The number of wordsin each jailbreak is also close to the original seed questions for the proposed method, while it issignificantly higher for most other attacks. Log Likelihood is computed using Gemma2-9B-IT.",

  "As seen in the above examples, several existing attacks (Andriushchenko et al., 2024; Paulus et al., 2024;": "Zou et al., 2023) contain contain text without any meaning, and thus can be easily detected using perplexitythresholding based methods. We present the minimum log likelihood across text chunks of window size=5and stride=1, for the above considered attacks in . We note that these attacks indeed have significantlylower values of log likelihood. Further, across all attacks, the proposed approach ReG-QA has the highest valueof minimum log likelihood across chunks, and is close to the value for seed questions, indicating that thereare no non-natural parts in the question. We additionally note that the number of words in each jailbreak islowest for the proposed approach, and is also close to the seed questions, while there is a significant increase inlength (2.2 - 25) for the baselines, as they incorporate repeated instructions/ arbitrary text to jailbreak thetarget LLM. We note that the small increase in length for the proposed approach (1.17) is possibly because ofincorporating additional information or hints from the answer in the generated queries.",

  "Oracle/ Ideal classifier": "| Schematic diagram of data distributions showing actual Safety Classifier and OracleSafety Classifier boundaries, highlighting the mechanism of operation of the proposed methodReG-QA: Let R4 denote the space of all text which may or may not have semantic meaning, R3 denotea subset of R4 containing text with semantic meaning, R2 denote the pre-training data distribution,and R0 denote the fine-tuning data distribution, with R1 being the region close to the fine-tuning datadistribution. Let us consider two classifier boundaries - the one in solid black is the actual classifierthat is trained on the fine-tuning data in R0 (T) and R0 (S) (T: Toxic, S: Safe), and the one in dashedgreen is an Oracle/ Ideal Classifier. The fine-tuning data is rightly classified by both classifiers, andhence results in safe responses at the output of an LLM system that incorporates such as filter as itssafety mechanism. While augmentations from Para-QA expand the distribution of toxic questions,they do not produce jailbreaks due to the generalization of safety-fine-tuning. However, ReG-QA hasa significantly wider distribution as it incorporates hints from the distribution of toxic answers, whichis a much larger surface within the unsafe region of the Oracle Classifier. Thus, the region covered bythese ReG-QA augmentations in the safe region of the actual classifier, and unsafe region of the Oracleclassifier form Jailbreaks to the model. Different from standard attacks (A3/ A4), these jailbreaks liewithin the pre-training data distribution, and are thus natural.",
  "E. ReG-QA: Mechanism of Operation": "In this section, we aim to provide an intuition behind the mechanism of operation of the proposed methodReG-QA. We consider a Safety trained LLM to be a combination of a safety filter or classifier that determines thesafety of the input query, and an unaligned LLM whose output is blocked when the filter detects the input to beunsafe, resulting in a denial response such as I cannot fulfil your request\". When the input is determined to besafe, the LLM response is outputted. Let us consider a sentence embedding model that embeds all tokens in aquestion and combines them using mean pooling. Consider a seed question (from the fine-tuning dataset)whose tokens are given by , ...[]. Let us consider a map : (, []) to be the embeddingfunction of the token given the entire context . Suppose some subset of tokens [0 : ] has highcorrelation with safety classifiers unsafe output, then paraphrasing (Para-QA) would have token embeddingsthat most likely still span the vector space ((, ) ). Thus, the question augmentations produced byPara-QA would also be deemed as unsafe by the classifier, resulting in the LLM producing a denial response asexpected.Let us assume we have toxic answers that add another set of undesirable tokens in addition to in the , and if the proposed approach ReG-QA picks a few of them, say , the tokens for the sentenceembedding would span a much larger vector space ((, ) ), which was possibly unseen duringthe fine-tuning of the safety classifier. This results in the generation of jailbreaks using the proposed approach -within the safe region of the actual classifier, and unsafe region of the Oracle classifier, as shown in ."
