  "Abstract": "We demonstrate how the composition of two unsupervised clustering algorithms,AstroLink and FuzzyCat, makes for a powerful tool when studying galaxy for-mation and evolution. AstroLink is a general-purpose astrophysical clustering al-gorithm built for extracting meaningful hierarchical structure from point-cloud datadefined over any feature space, while FuzzyCat is a generalised soft-clusteringalgorithm that propagates the dynamical effects of underlying data processesinto a fuzzy hierarchy of stable fuzzy clusters. Their composition, FuzzyCat AstroLink, can therefore identify a fuzzy hierarchy of astrophysically- andstatistically-significant fuzzy clusters within any point-based data set whose repre-sentation is subject to changes caused by some underlying process. Furthermore,the pipeline achieves this without relying upon strong assumptions about the data,the change process, the number/importance of specific structure types, or muchuser input thereby making itself applicable to a wide range of fields in the phys-ical sciences. We find that for the task of structurally decomposing simulatedgalaxies into their constituents, our context-agnostic approach has a substantialimpact on the diversity and completeness of the structures extracted as well as ontheir relationship within the broader galactic structural hierarchy revealing dwarfgalaxies, infalling groups, stellar streams (and their progenitors), stellar shells,galactic bulges, and star-forming regions.",
  "Motivation and related work": "A pressing and continually evolving sub-field of astrophysics is the study of galaxy formation andevolution, which according to CDM cosmology, assemble hierarchically with time through mergersand the accretion of smaller galaxies . To understand how and why a galaxy and its substructuredevelop within the context of the surrounding environment and of the underlying cosmologicalmodel, astrophysicists and cosmologists will look to both observational and simulation data. Withobservations, we may learn from a very large number of galaxies that are each observed at a uniquesnapshot in time and that arise from the ground-truth cosmology of our Universe. While withsimulations, we may learn from many snapshots of a comparatively small number of galaxies thatdepend on a pre-specified cosmological model. By comparing these two data types, we can hope toconstrain our cosmological models as well as our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. A typical approach towards studying galaxy formation and evolution in the context of simulateddata is to use a halo finder (+ merger tree) code [e.g. 4, 18, 22, 43] to find a catalogue of (sub-)haloes and their merger history (and then to analyse the physical properties of their outputs). Thesecodes routinely perform similarly and robustly , however they onlyconsider mostly or completely self-bound groups that satisfy a minimum overdensity threshold. Ifthis threshold is too high then some haloes may not be detected and if it is too low then some haloes",
  "arXiv:2411.03229v1 [astro-ph.GA] 5 Nov 2024": "can be disregarded in the unbinding procedure. As such, these codes will tend not to capture tidallydisrupted groups or fleeting structures resulting from density waves, hydrodynamical effects, orstar-formation events. Not including these kinds of structures in any subsequent analysis ensures thatcosmological models used in simulations are never constrained against their existence even thoughtheir analogues are observed to be present in our Universe . It is for these reasons that weinvestigate the usefulness of a more generalised and context-agnostic approach.",
  "Finding stable clusters from evolving data: FuzzyCat AstroLink": "The FuzzyCat AstroLink pipeline operates on a data set whose representation is subject tochanges from an underlying process (such as stochastic resampling, temporal-evolution, etc.). Theapproach composes the two clustering algorithms by first applying AstroLink to the variousrealisations of the data and then applying FuzzyCat to the various AstroLink outputs. Theresult is an unsupervised machine learning pipeline that produces a fuzzy hierarchy of astrophysically-and statistically-significant fuzzy clusters that encapsulate the effects of the underlying process(es)implicit within an evolving input data set. To our knowledge, such a pipeline has not yet existed.",
  "The AstroLink algorithm": "AstroLink is an unsupervised astrophysical clustering algorithm that extracts arbitrarily-shapedhierarchical clusters from an arbitrarily-shaped point-based data set such that the clusters foundare statistical outliers from noisy density fluctuations. It is an improvement to its predecessors,CluSTAR-ND and Halo-OPTICS , and by comparison boasts increased clustering power inshorter run-times. It also shares algorithmic ties to, but is more statistically robust than, OPTICS and HDBSCAN . These can be thought of hierarchical extensions of DBSCAN , which itselfcan be thought of as a more-robust-to-noise version of the Friends-Of-Friends (FOF) algorithm an algorithm commonly used to identify galaxies/haloes from cosmological simulations. The AstroLink algorithm performs five steps; (1) data rescaling, (2) local-density estimation, (3) dataaggregation, (4) model-fitting and structure identification, (5) hierarchy correction. If adaptive = 1(default), step 1 rescales the data to have unit variance so as to remove the effect of differing unitsin the feature space. Step 2 calculates the local-density of each data point by applying a multivariateEpanechnikov kernel and a balloon estimator to its kden-neighbourhood (kden = 20, default) the logarithm of this estimate is taken before all values are then normalised, i.e. log .Step 3 tracks and records the connected components of data points that form as the edges of alocal-density-weighted klink-nearest-neighbour graph (klink is data-driven by default) are traversedin descending order these components define a hierarchy of feature-space overdensities. In step4, a model is fit to the clusteredness of these connected components and is used to identify the S-outlier overdensities (S is data-driven by default) from the noisy local-density fluctuationsinherent within the data. If h_style = 1 (default), step 5 corrects the final hierarchy by incorporatingsome additional outlier overdensities producing the final hierarchy of clusters. AstroLink does notrequire the user to make any hyperparameter choices as the performance of the entirely data-drivenversion of this process is near-optimal in nearly all cases. When applied to simulated galaxies,AstroLink does extraordinarily well at finding the remnants of infalling-satellites within the data.The implementation is described in more detail in the original science paper as well as in theAstroLink ReadTheDocs page .",
  "The FuzzyCat algorithm": "FuzzyCat is an unsupervised general-purpose soft-clustering algorithm that, given a series of clus-terings on object-based data, produces data-driven fuzzy clusters whose membership functionsencapsulate the effects of changes in the clusters due to changes in the feature space representation ofthe objects themselves. The different input clusterings may be governed by any underlying processthat affects the clustering structure (e.g. stochasticity, temporal evolution, model hyperparametervariation, etc.). In effect, FuzzyCat propagates these effects into a soft-clustering which has hadthese effects abstracted away into the membership functions of the original object-based data.",
  "At its core, FuzzyCat is very similar to AstroLink procedures mimicking steps 2, 3, and 4 areanalogously performed except that it takes a data set of clusters as input as opposed to one of": "data points. It is in this sense that FuzzyCat is actually a clustering algorithm that operates on theJaccard-space of a catalogue of clusterings in order to produce clusters of clusters (i.e. fuzzy clusters).As such the Jaccard index, which is calculated for every pair of clusters in the input, is analogousto the AstroLink log calculated in step 2 although in FuzzyCat there is no equivalent to kdenand klink is effectively fixed at the size of the data set. The final fuzzy clusters, found after a processequivalent to the AstroLink step 3, must also meet thresholds (measured by the Jaccard index) ofinternal similarity (Jmin_intra = 0.5, default) and external dissimilarity (Jmax_inter = 0.5, default),as well as remain stable over at least a minimum number of data set realisations. The latter conditionis governed by the minStability hyperparameter, which we change from the default value of 0.5for the applications in Sec. 4. These conditions ensure statistical robustness with the correspondinghyperparameters effectively playing the role of the AstroLink S-parameter. The final fuzzy clustersare then translated into membership functions with respect to the underlying object-based data bycounting the number of data realisations for which each object appears within each fuzzy cluster. It is worth clarifying that FuzzyCat is never provided any knowledge of the feature space representa-tion of the object-based input data set nor of the underlying change process that acts upon it i.e.it makes no assumptions about why clusters of these objects exist nor about how they may changebetween any two clusterings. It is easier to see why FuzzyCat can be applied to a stochasticallychanging clustering (as in Sec. 3) as opposed to a temporally evolving one (as in Sec. 2) howeverthe strong temporal correlation between consecutive snapshots produces a statistically significantclustering signal resulting in physically meaningful cluster tracking. We refer the reader to theFuzzyCat ReadTheDocs page for more details.",
  "A simple use case": ": The FuzzyCat AstroLink pipeline applied to uncertaintoy data (code & results found here). Left: A random sample of thedata with coloured points belonging to AstroLink clusters. Right:The resultant fuzzy clusters found by FuzzyCat after 100 resam-plings/clusterings of the data with the opacity and colour of pointsrepresenting the membership function (in this case a probability) ofa data point to belong to a particular fuzzy cluster. We first take a detour from thefocus of this work and demon-strate the versatility of thispipeline by applying it to a 2Dtoy data set whereby the un-derlying process that changesthe data is stochastic resam-pling due to the effect of uncer-tainties. In this exercise, eachdata points uncertainty pro-file is a 2D Gaussian distribu-tion with identical covariancematrices equal to 2I where = 0.05. The data has beenresampled and clustered 100times by AstroLink and thenFuzzyCat is applied to these resampled clusterings (with both algorithms using their default settings). depicts the results, where we see that the effect of stochastically resampling from the uncer-tainty profiles of the data points is to give fuzzy boundaries to the AstroLink clusters. Although wedont explore this function further in this work, it shows that the FuzzyCat AstroLink pipeline iscapable of propagating uncertainties into clusters. Such a function would also be highly beneficialfor studying galaxy formation and evolution in the context of observational data, as well as for otherareas of the physical sciences where uncertainties are inherent to the data used.",
  "Applications to NIHAO-UHD galaxies and comparison with AHF": "We now apply the FuzzyCat AstroLink pipeline to a set of six simulated galaxies from theNIHAO-UHD suite detailed in Sec. 4.1. We first apply AstroLink with its default settings tothe 6D position-velocity feature space of the stellar particles in each snapshot of each galaxy. We thenprovide the resultant clusterings to FuzzyCat where we choose the minStability hyperparametersuch that the resultant fuzzy clusters exist for 230 Myr (approximately the period of the Sunsorbit within the Milky Way). So as to draw a comparison to current methods, we also apply AmigasHalo Finder (AHF) to the same set of galaxies see Sec. 4.2 for details on this code.",
  "multi-shelledtidal debris": ": Frames from animations (code & results found here) of clusterings produced by AHF(left) and the FuzzyCat AstroLink pipeline (right). Each row shows the snapshots file name (i.e.galaxy_mass.snapshot_number) and look-back time. Each panel depicts a full 3D projection(axes extend 100 kpc from the galactic centre), and for our approach, a zoomed-in top-down view ofthe galactic disk (i.e. everything within the central white prism of width 50 kpc and height 10 kpc). depicts various frames from the animations generated via both AHF and the FuzzyCat AstroLink pipeline. Among the structures extracted by our approach are; dwarf galaxies, infallinggroups, stellar streams (and their progenitors), stellar shells, galactic bulges, and star-forming regions.By comparison, traditional approaches are not able to find most of this structure beyond a subsetof which is (or is mostly) self-bound this can be seen with the corresponding results from AHF.Our pipeline therefore reveals much more of the information content of these galaxies, and as such,lends itself as a powerful tool for analysing galaxy formation and evolution in a modern setting. Werefer the reader to the FuzzyCat ReadTheDocs page for a coded tutorial of this work as well asanimations of the phase-temporal clusterings for each of the six galaxies by each of the codes.",
  "The NIHAO-UHD suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations": "The NIHAO-UHD suite is an ultra-high resolution subset of the Numerical Investigation ofa Hundred Astronomical Objects (NIHAO) simulation suite which assumes cosmologicalparameters from the 2015 Planck Collaboration et al. . These galaxies are chosen to reflect themost MW-like galaxies in terms of mass, size and disk properties. Parts of the simulation suite havepreviously been used to study the build-up of MWs peanut-shaped bulge , investigate the stellarbar properties , infer the MWs dark halo spin , study the dwarf galaxy inventory of MWmass galaxies , and investigate the age-metallicity relation of MW disk stars including thechemical bimodality of disk stars , their abundances and the origin of very metal-poor starsinside the stellar disk . Because of their realistic cosmology, complex hydrodynamical nature,and advanced physical realism, the NIHAO-UHD galaxies serve as an excellent probe for studyinggalaxy formation and evolution as well as to showcase the novel capabilities of our pipeline.",
  "Amigas Halo Finder": "As a comparison to our approach, we apply the halo finder AHF2 to each snapshot of eachsimulated galaxy. It works by recursively refining a grid in a top-down manner to identify spatialregions within the simulation box that meet a certain overdensity threshold (200 times the criticaldensity of the Universe, in this case). Once particles are identified as belonging to such regions,an iterative unbinding procedure is performed to remove all particles whose velocity exceeds theescape velocity at that particles position within the given halo (this assumes a spherically symmetricdensity profile for the halo). The recursive and iterative nature of this algorithm yields a hierarchyof (sub)haloes bounded groups with an overdensity above a threshold. With the haloes of eachsnapshot now found, temporal merger trees are calculated using the AHF analysis tool, MergerTree,which traces the particle IDs of all particles throughout the snapshots and identifies all progenitors ofa given halo. The animations, from which the frames in are taken, plot the star particles fromeach AHF halo with a colour that is passed down from its father halo (its most similar progenitorfrom the previous snapshot). In this sense, these animations are the AHF analogue of those producedusing the results of the FuzzyCat AstroLink pipeline.",
  "Conclusion and outlook": "In this work, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the FuzzyCat AstroLink pipeline asa novel unsupervised machine learning approach particularly as a tool for analysing simulatedgalaxies in the context of galaxy formation and evolution. By applying our pipeline to the NIHAO-UHD suite, we have shown that it can successfully identify a diverse range of astrophysical structuresthat traditional halo finder (+ merger tree) methods do not capturing transient and tidally disruptedstructures that are often overlooked in conventional analyses. As such, it provides the means to amore comprehensive understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. The ability of the FuzzyCat AstroLink pipeline to adapt to data with underlying processes, suchas stochastic variations and temporal evolution, positions it as a powerful tool for future studies inastrophysics and in other fields where data is fuzzy, dynamic, and complex. By overcoming thelimitations of existing methods, our approach offers its user a more flexible and detailed examinationof the hierarchical and multifaceted nature of astrophysical structures. We now intend to improveupon our pipeline through massive parallel (re-)implementations of AstroLink and FuzzyCat opening application avenues to a broader range of cosmological simulations and observational datasets, thereby enhancing our understanding of our Universes structure at multiple scales.",
