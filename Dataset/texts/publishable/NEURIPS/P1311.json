  "Abstract": "This paper proposes dialogue as a novel and experimental qualitative method forevaluating generative AI tools for culturally-situated creative practice. Drawingon sociologist Howard Beckers concept of Art Worlds, this method expands thescope of traditional AI and creativity evaluations beyond benchmarks, user studieswith crowd-workers, or focus groups conducted with artists. Our method involvestwo mutually informed dialogues: 1) dialogues with art worlds, placing artistsin conversation with experts such as art historians, curators, and archivists, and 2)dialogues with the machine, facilitated through structured artist- and critic-ledexperimentation with state-of-the-art generative AI tools. We demonstrate the valueof this method through a case study with artists and experts steeped in non-westernart worlds, specifically the Persian Gulf. We trace how these dialogues help createculturally rich and situated forms of evaluation for representational possibilitiesof generative AI that mimic the reception of generative artwork in the broader artecosystem. They also allow artists to shift their use of the tools to respond to theircultural and creative context. Our study can provide generative AI researchers anunderstanding of complex dynamics of technology, creativity and the socio-politicsof art worlds, to build more inclusive machines for diverse art worlds.",
  "Introduction": "In his seminal work Art Worlds, sociologist Howard Becker emphasized the fundamentally collabora-tive nature of art creation . Instead of focusing on a singular, isolated genius or on the aestheticoutput, he argued for the study of an art world the network of critics, curators, suppliers, adminis-trators, and audiences who shape artistic activity. The study of art in this conception should not beisolated to artistic outputs, but also encompass the social processes that make art production possible.Said differently, we should study what artists do and how they do it, not just artistic symbolism orcomposition. Art production in this view is an inherently social process, not an individual or technicalone. This scholarship changed the way art was studied . As generative AI is integrated into the artistic domain, it also enters into existing art worlds andcreates the possibility of shaping its own art worlds . Applying Beckers perspective to generativeAI, the existing evaluation paradigm of AI for creativity must necessarily become social and thus",
  "arXiv:2412.14077v1 [cs.CY] 18 Dec 2024": "expand in both its focus (beyond the output) and in who it involves (beyond the artist). Yet, existingbenchmark-centered studies on creativity have focused on quantitative metrics for outputs (e.g., basedon human evaluations of the generated images quality vs. its prompt such as in DrawBridge ,PartiPrompts , or conversely, of the ambiguity of crowdsourced annotations of images ) or onautomated methods and datasets for Artistic Image Aesthetic Assessment , including measuresof the diversity of generated images , of their novelty vs. an existing dataset or conversely,similarity to an desired image style . More recently, there has been an emerging focus on socio-technical evaluations of AI. These ap-proaches draw on qualitative methods, bringing in more participatory perspectives, and ultimatelyexpand the frame of what is being evaluated . While these get closer to understanding AIas a socio-technical artifact, these studies have primarily centered on conversations with artiststhrough interviews, with only a handful studies focusing on artists experimenting with tools directlyor bringing artists into conversation with one . Their scope is also often narrowlyfocused on the usefulness of a generative AI tool for artists as a creativity support tool , evenas they generate great insight into the individual artists interactions with AI and demonstrate thevarious ways in which artists use and conceptualize emerging AI tools. Other qualitative studiesfocus on economic impacts for artists and perceptions of creativity and collaboration .The scope and method of these qualitative studies could be expanded to explore the ways in whichgenerative art will be received by art worlds, shape new art worlds, or how collectively culturalcommunities could push the possibilities of representation in generative AI. We fill this gap by introducing an experimental dialogic evaluation of AI for creativity couplingtwo types of dialogues: dialogue with the machine and dialogue with the art world. These mutuallyinformed dialogues are a step towards a more culturally informed evaluation of AI in art, that canmimic its reception in the art world, internalize its social impacts while also honing in on the particularcreative processes it enables or constrains. In this paper we present the application of our approach within a concrete case study where weexplored generative AI as a creative tool for cultural representation , within the cultural contextof the Persian Gulf. We instantiated the dialogue with machines as a multi-week experimentationperiod with artists using state-of-the-art generative AI tools. We instantiated the dialogue with theart world as workshops and reflections with artists and other stakeholders of the collective art worldthat AI is entering into, such as art historians, curators and archivists. The dialogue was mediated byresearchers working in an AI lab who acted as facilitators of the workshops, by asking questions andpairing artists and experts for 1:1 dialogue. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. First,we introduce our dialogic evaluation method, motivating its value and detailing how we approachedthe two dialogues within our case study. Next, we present our case study and trace two dialogues thatexemplify the value of this approach. Finally, we close by reflecting on our approach and the uniqueinsights offered for Generative AI development through dialogue as a method. As a demonstration ofthe value of elevating diverse forms of multi-disciplinary expertise for AI evaluations, this paper hasbeen co-authored with scholars and artists who participated in the study.",
  "Dialogue with Art Worlds: Evaluating Creativity as an Ecosystem": "According to Martin Zeilinger, human creativity is dialogic, relational, and fundamentally intertex-tual a social act . One of the lessons of art history is that art was not developed in vacuum, buthas been a dialogue between creator, receivers, audience, about symbols, processes and interpretation. Then, evaluations of art are also necessarily social. We propose a method that allowsus to engage the creative ecosystem to understand the impacts of AI in art production. By engagingexperts in existing art worlds, we aim to expand the idea of who can evaluate generative AI, arguingthat these evaluations should not just be the remit of AI researchers or of atomic communities ofartists.",
  ": Overview of the dialogue-based approach followed in this study": "To construct a dialogue with art worlds, we placed artists in conversation with a multi-perspectivepanel of cultural experts (hereafter referred to as commentators) to evaluate different dimensions ofgenerative AI, such as how generative AI could shape cultural relevance and meaning of artworks,the forms of agency it affords or that artists can wrest from it and its possibilities as a tool for culturaland political representation. By applying these critical reflections on the generative AI productionprocess and the outputs artists produced during the study, this process mimics what the reception ofthe generated artwork might be. We set up two interactive workshops. One workshop preceded the experimentation period of artists(discussed in .2) and one workshop followed it. Before the workshops we also askedeach participant to record an introductory video showcasing their work and ideas for the study,which were viewed by all participants before the workshop. During workshop 1, we collectivelyreflected on the possibilities of generative AI broadly and historical intersections of technology andart. Commentators and artists also broke up into one-on-one loosely structured conversations tocollectively develop ideas for the artists projects. In the second workshop we collectively evaluatedartists processes and outputs, situating them within broader histories of art in the cultural context ofthe artists. Artists also had opportunities to attend office hours with commentators and researchersand to discuss their projects throughout the experimentation period.",
  "Dialogue with Machines: Structured Artistic Experimentation with Generative AI Tools": "AI researchers have called for an investigation into how the novel AI technologies are used ineveryday creative processes which can shift AI towards more diverse forms of visual artcollaboration and assistance . Creating room for free form experimentation by artists duringour study allows us to mimic real world use similarly to workshops done in . However, one keydifference in our study is that experimentation with the machine is informed by the dialogue with thecommentators, to mimic the reception of generated art in the art world. Within our study, artists participated in a multi-week experimental study where they used generativeAI tools to produce culturally situated media artifacts that tell stories of their own identities thathave traditionally not been represented in dominant media. Artists were free to use any model1,technique, and dataset they wanted. Ideas for what they explored and created during this period wereinformed by the dialogue with commentators in the first workshop, and shaped through periodicmeetings with commentators throughout the experimentation period. Artists were encouraged toexperiment with prompt engineering and fine-tuning as approaches to steer models towards theirdesired representations. Artists documented and shared their process and experience in a series ofprocess logs and reflection videos. This method allows us to study not just artistic outputs but also processes of artistic production. Thestudy of such processes is significant in extending the artists use of generative AI tools beyond thefinal artistic product, and also its impacts on the way they produce things. The process is as importantin art as the output. Knowing about creative processes can also help us identify gaps in design,interface, interactions of generative AI systems and thus present developers with actionable pathwaysfor improving generative AI as a tool for cultural representation. Moreover, having this processbe informed by collective reflections also helps us see how far artists can push existing tools formore radical possibilities. This means insights and recommendations that emerge from this mutuallyinformed dialogue do not just improve the interface of the technology but also its possibilities of usein different cultural contexts and use cases.",
  "Participant recruitment": "We recruited three artists and three commentators through personal networks of professional col-laboration. Prior work with art worlds had helped us build connections that we leveraged fora snowball sampling of artists who both 1) had some experience with digital computational toolsfor creativity in their artistic practice and 2) identified with the Persian Gulf region (either throughlived experience, heritage, or through their work). We similarly recruited art commentators who hadexpertise on the art world and social histories in the Persian Gulf. The artists expertise include graphical art, video, sculpture, architecture and design, and their workhas been exhibited, among others, at Saatchi or Christies galleries, at the Venice Biennale or at CentrePompidou. The commentators hold positions at universities in the US and museums in the UK similarto the British Museum, Tate and V&A. All commentators and artists were deeply immersed in the artworlds of the Persian Gulf. Two artists were Iranian with extensive history of making art representingIranian contexts, one artist was of Armenian descent (a minority group within Iran) and a landscapescholar, one commentator was an expert in Iranian art history and media, one commentator hadtraining in the architecture and history of Islamic worlds and one commentator was the Iran curator ata major global museum in the UK. This sampling ensured contextually focused conversations. The artists and commentators names are withheld for privacy. Throughout the following subsectionswe refer to artists with a numeric participant identifier (e.g. Artist-1, Artist-2, and Artist-3). We referto commentators based on their expertise (e.g. Art Historian, Architectural Historian, Curator).",
  "Tracing the Benefit of Dialogues": "In this section we present evidence of the utility of this method for technology developers by tracingtwo dialogues that i) distill decentralized datasets as a pathway for improved cultural representa-tion (Dialogue A) and ii) surface possibilities for culturally situated generative AI use-cases withincreative domains (Dialogue B). Coupling the the artists experimentation with the dialogues withcommentators allowed us to interrogate and understand what culturally situated creativity is possiblethrough the current technological state, and what interventions might be needed to give more agencyto non-western artists. The collective conversation particularly helped us learn from histories of pasttechnologies intervening in artistic practice, to gain an understanding of how we can analyze genera-tive AI as a technology of artistic practice. These dialogues also allowed artists and commentators tocollectively develop visions for generative AI through their experimentation, practice, and discussionthat were suitable to the art worlds they were part of and attuned to the different processes of theartists.",
  "Dialogue A: Aspirations for decentralized datasets": "We present a dialogue where multiple artists developed a specific pathway towards more culturallysituated generative AI: building decentralized datasets. We present the multiple dialogues betweenthe artists and commentators and artists and machines, through which artists iteratively added layersof specificity for this pathway. One exchange that led to this aspiration was between Artist-3 and the Museum Curator, discussing thelimitations of existing datasets for female Iranian representation such as Qajar2 paintings or museumdatasets. To address these limitations, Artist-3 developed an innovative approach by creating threedistinct AI models, each drawing from different cultural sources. The first model utilized Instagramphotos to capture contemporary representations of Iranian women, reflecting the modern digitallandscape. This approach prompted the Museum Curator and Artist-3 to collectively explore theexclusions embedded in social media platforms, which may reflect certain normative standards. Artist-",
  "Qajar art corresponds to the architecture and paintings produced during the Qajar dynasty, which lastedfrom 1781 to 1925 in Persia / Iran": "3 understood the need to counterbalance these modern influences in visual data with more grounded,historical perspectives. The second model therefore delved into historical depth by analyzing vintagephotos from what the Museum Curator characterized as a counter archive: the Qajar WomensWorld Archive3, which presented the female perspective on Qajar dynasties. The third model wastrained on traditional Iranian paintings, introducing an artistic layer that rooted the character in culturalheritage. These three models were looped together by the artist in an iterative process to create avisual character that embodied a mosaic of lived experiences, historical narratives, and cultural artistry.This dialogue between the machine, artist and commentators ultimately prompted the suggestion of adecentralized library, akin to Wikipedia, to drive AI datasets towards a more collective effort whichcould push models towards more culturally rich forms of visuality: decentralized and everyone areinputting and people are saying when there is some part missing, they can go and find and add to itand if its wrong, other people can edit. Another dialogue, between Artist-1 and the Art Historian, also focused on decentralized datasets.However, this dialogue resisted the idea that openness was an inherent good, and instead suggesteddecentralized libraries with restricted access as means of protecting community knowledge. Thisexchange started with a more theoretical concern expressed by the Art Historian. In response tosuggestions of more data collection to improve representation of different global cultures withingenerative AI, the Art Historian expressed a feeling of discomfort about AI being able to knoweverything about Iran: but I personally feel like maybe its OK for Iran to have these secrets. Whydo we need to let technology to know this complex, complicated country through and through? Thisprovocative prompt evolved into ideas around decentralized datasets with access restrictions to enableprotecting knowledge while giving access to knowledge (Artist-1). Artist-1 reflected on the need forsystems built for us by us... Or by us for us and in conversation with the Art Historian reflectedon how they could actually practice that. They suggested, as an example, a dataset that onlyspecific people could use based on a specific archive, which was not always available to everyone,imagining systems that can be localized and decentralized by building your own library, pullingsomething, making something that data doesnt go anywhere? For the Art Historian, this was a wayto decolonize technology by making sure data would not be used for the same power structuresthat create all the sources of knowledge... not necessarily producing it for the same institutions thatmarginalized those people in the first place. So while Artist-3s idea of decentralized libraries imagined these datasets as a sort of collectivecommons, the Art Historian and Artist-1s reflections questioned the inherent value of open accessand inclusivity without setting the terms of inclusion: is inclusivity, is open source inherently good,you know, which the answer is no, its not inherently good (Artist-1). This led Artist-1 to approachthe idea of decentralized libraries from the perspective of protection of knowledge systems. Boththese exchanges demonstrated how iterative exchanges with commentators and the machine canhelp artists develop more novel, progressive, and recommendations for more inclusive generative AI.The unique pathways both conversations took showed how the same aspiration can have differentinstantiations and operationalization.",
  "Dialogue B: Using Generative AI for Representational Possibilities": "In this section we trace another dialoguebetween one artist, multiple commentators, and the machinethat shaped ideas of how generative AI output could be used for cultural representation. We showhow investigating, through dialogue, the historical context of an artwork, the intention of the artist,and their knowledge about the cultural context within which they are working offers a new lens intothe art itself and can even push the artist to think deeper about their work. This exchange began with a discussion between one artist and the commentators in workshop 1, thatultimately shifted the artists project idea for the experimentation period. Artist-2 was struck bytwo highly divergent understandings of Persianness articulated by two different commentators. Thefirst focused on a historical outsiders view of Persianness, framed through the Western Culturalimaginary... through certain kinds of artifacts, through a particular period in history (MuseumCurator). The second offered an on the ground understanding of Persianness defined by everydaylife through everyday forms of resistance (Art Historian). Inspired by this, Artist-2 used their projectto push against the fixity of definitions that AI might produce to shape a particular idea of Persianness.They explored this idea using generative AI to create what they referred to as hybridized imagery that integrated slogans known to represent acts of resistance (such as Woman, Life, Freedom) intohistorical cultural artifacts (such as carpets and ceramics). Ultimately, their goal was to leveragegenerative AI to reimagin[e] these historical artifacts as new sites for activism (Artist-2). In workshop 2, the artists and commentators reconvened to collectively reflect upon the generatedimages and the way generative AI offered up a potentially new avenue for responding to colonialhistories and outsiders views of Persianness. One commentator reflected on the inherently politicalhistory of carpets, and was intrigued by the Artist-2s intent to explicitly politicize carpets throughthe new synthetic and hybridized carpet images. Moreover, Artist-2 was aesthetically pleased withthe seamless integration of the graffiti into the carpets and ceramics: the graffiti look like threadsof the carpet were part of the graffiti that was literally woven into it. And same with the graffiti sothat it felt like it was embedded within the design of the polychrome ceramic kind of patterning.At the same time, the group reflection on the synthetic images also surfaced a nuanced critiqueof current generative AI capabilities. While the generated images integrated the slogans into thecarpets and ceramics in aesthetically compelling ways, the text rendered was gibberish and wasntcommunicating anything language-wise (Artist-2). While participants recognized that text generationcapabilities are limited across the board in current generative AI tools, the stakes of this particularfailure were high. Commentators drew the connection between the generated images and culturalappropriation through pseudo-calligraphy utilized during the Byzantine and Renaissance periods:this reminds me of 19th century orientalist paintings when they paint carpets and they go squiggle,squiggle, squiggle (Museum Curator). Despite these representational limits, commentators andartists noted the role of art as social commentary, and Artist-2 reflect on how they would want anaudience to interact with such art: if its generating something thats pointing to a period and kindof continues the same kind of historical patterns, then I would want to work with that, but kind ofpoint it against itself. So it would still be an activist, political act. This exchange also convincedcommentators that generative AI could have a more radical potential for cultural representation.The pushing of these representational possibilities were high stakes; Architectural Historian noted therisk of AI flattening and erasing, and pushing our imagination towards a much narrower range. These exchanges shifted the artists use of generative AI tools to explore radical possibilities situatedwithin the cultural ecosystem of the artist and the broader role of art in society. Experimentationshowed how artists might push the tools forward in light of political histories and use generative AI asa tool for intervening in those histories or for offering critical commentary on those histories. Theseexchanges also offered a nuanced evaluation and critique of generative AI limitations, contextualizedwithin colonial histories and outsiders views of Persian culture and art that could provide importanttakeaways for the design of generative AI tools that do not repeat the mistakes of the past while alsogiving inspiration for methods of interrogation possibilities of generative art for artists. Here, theidea of what artists may want to explore and evaluation of the output came through dialogue withcommentators.",
  "Discussion and Takeaways": "The dialogic method we propose allows us to evaluate AIs role within a culturally-situated ecosystemof creativity in a particular context. We were able to understand elements of generative AIs outputswhich would be evaluated within their reception in the art world. Our approach also recognizes thatthere are more impacted communities in this ecosystem that have essential expertise for appropriateevaluation of models within particular cultural context and use cases. By elevating their expertisewe follow other forms of community-centered evaluations of AI and add to existingmethods for evaluating the complex interplay between technology, creativity and socio-politics of theart world. Such holisitic engagement can offer metrics for AI creativity tools that are more relevant tothe non-western world, fostering a more nuanced discourse on the role of AI in creative processes. Our dialogic approach surfaces design pathways that are attuned to the broader socio-political ecosys-tem of creativity and culture and can help build tools which could live up to arts representationaland social potentials, especially in non-western contexts. We did not have space to dive into theaspirations and recommendations that emerged from this study, which will be published separately asa full paper. Nonetheless, we offered up examples of mutually-informed dialogues between artists,commentators, and machines to showcase how this approach shifted artists use of the tools to test formore radical possibilities rooted in their cultural context and how they developed pathways that coulddrive the development of culturally relevant and meaningful tools for non-western artists.",
