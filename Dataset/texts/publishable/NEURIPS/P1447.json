  "Abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are often sycophantic, prioritizing agreementwith their users over accurate or objective statements. This problematic behaviorbecomes more pronounced during reinforcement learning from human feedback(RLHF), an LLM fine-tuning stage intended to align model outputs with human val-ues. Instead of increasing accuracy and reliability, the reward model learned fromRLHF often rewards sycophancy. We develop a linear probing method to identifyand penalize markers of sycophancy within the reward model, producing rewardsthat discourage sycophantic behavior. Our experiments show that constructing andoptimizing against this surrogate reward function reduces sycophantic behaviorin multiple open-source LLMs. Our results suggest a generalizable methodologyfor reducing unwanted LLM behaviors that are not sufficiently disincentivized byRLHF fine-tuning.",
  "Introduction": "Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit complex unwanted behaviors, such as reinforcing harm-ful biases , sharing dangerous information , or sycophantically agreeing with the usersopinions . Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) fine-tuning reducesmany of these unwanted behaviors, but faces many limitations , and can actually exacerbate syco-phancy . Sycophantic LLMs compromise their objectivity and reliability by disproportionatelyagreeing with their users, even on objectively false statements . This systematic failuredemonstrates a dangerous limitation of RLHF fine-tuning, and indicates that additional work isneeded to control complex LLM behaviors. In this work, we propose a method for augmenting rewardmodels to reduce such unwanted behaviors. RLHF is a widespread method for shaping ML system behavior based on human feedback .In RLHF, we gather human preferences over sets of outcomes, fit a reward model (RM) to predictthese preferences, then use reinforcement learning to optimize ML system behavior using a syntheticreward signal generated by the reward model. RLHF is remarkably effective at shaping hard-to-specify LLM behaviors, such as reducing toxic or harmful language , improving helpful responsesto user queries , and encouraging honest responses . However, RLHF appears to actuallyexacerbate sycophancy, perhaps because human annotators often prefer text responses that agreewith their views, even if they dont necessarily prefer that LLMs be sycophantic overall . Thispoints to a dangerous limitation of RLHF it is difficult for humans to provide high-quality feedbackabout complex behaviors, and some problematic behaviors may only be identifiable at a system-widescale . We address this limitation by augmenting the reward model with a synthetic reward signal based onits internal representations of unwanted behaviors. This is possible because LLMs encode some high-level concepts linearly in their latent spaces, allowing us to recover them with linear probes .",
  "We propose identifying and leveraging internal representations of sycophancy in order to penalizesycophantic behavior": "Our method employs a linear probe within the reward model to quantify the extent of sycophancy inthe AIs responses. We then modify the reward model to penalize responses based on their sycophancyscore. We find that optimizing against this augmented reward model successfully reduces sycophanticbehavior in multiple large open-source LLMs. Our results not only showcase a concrete method forreducing sycophancy, but suggest a general methodology for reducing unwanted LLM behaviors thatare ignored or exacerbated by RLHF. We introduce our metric for measuring sycophancy in .1. In .2, we describe howto train the sycophancy probe and use it to augment the reward model. Finally, in weoptimize a large open-source language model against the augmented reward using best-of-N (BoN)sampling (i.e. selecting the highest reward-scoring output from N options), and find that our techniqueeffectively reduces sycophancy. We hope this work will inspire further research into modifying thereward model to better reduce unwanted or dangerous LLM behavior.",
  "Background": "Sharma et al. provide the most comprehensive study on sycophancy in LLMs. They identifyand categorize three distinct types of sycophantic behavior:feedback sycophancy occurs whenAI assistants are asked to evaluate user-provided text (such as poems, arguments, or mathematicalsolutions) and offer positive feedback on texts preferred by the users, alongside negative feedback ontexts disliked by the users; answer sycophancy arises when AI assistants adjust their responses toalign with the users beliefs in tasks involving open-ended factual question-answering; and mimicrysycophancy occurs when AI assistants replicate a users errors in their responses, in scenarios wherethe queries are unrelated to the users original mistake. Sharma et al. find that both feedbacksycophancy and mimicry sycophancy increase under RLHF, and that feedback sycophancy alsoincreases under BoN sampling. This paper focuses on feedback sycophancy due to its demonstratedincrease under BoN sampling, which provides a more tractable experimental setup compared to thecomplexities of reinforcement learning algorithms. Prior attempts to reduce sycophancy use supervised fine-tuning or contrastive steering. In the firstapproach, Wei et al. use the three sycophancy benchmarks from : natural language processingsurvey questions (NLP), philosophy survey questions (PHIL), and political typology quiz questions(POLI). They construct a synthetic dataset by pairing NLP questions with correct LLM responsesthat dont depend on the users opinion. Fine-tuning 4 variants of Flan-PALM on this dataset leads toan average decrease of 20% in sycophancy scores across models on the NLP benchmark. However,this fails to generalize to improvements on the POLI and PHIL benchmarks. In the second approach, Rimsky et al. compute contrastive steering vectors by calculating thedifference between activations of sycophantic and non-sycophantic responses at a specific LLM layer,using NLP and POLI datasets. They add or subtract these vectors during the forward pass in anattempt to reduce the frequency of sycophantic responses. However, their experiments on Llama2 7Bchat and Llama2 13B chat models show inconsistent results: while subtracting the contrastive vectordecreased sycophancy as expected, adding it also unexpectedly decreased sycophancy. Moreover,this approach demonstrates limited generalization capabilities on open-ended questions.",
  "Measuring sycophancy": "We develop a surrogate reward function that penalizes the LLM for sycophantic behavior, and find thatoptimizing against this surrogate reward using BoN sampling indeed decreases feedback sycophancy.We focus on feedback sycophancy specifically because it is exacerbated by both RLHF and BoN : Feedback sycophancy evaluation procedure. The like feedback positivity measures howoften the model gives more positive feedback to poems that the user likes. Conversely, the dislikefeedback positivity measures how often the model gives more positive feedback to poems that theuser dislikes.",
  ". Dislike prefix feedback: Before requesting feedback, we specify to the model, I reallydislike the poem": "We collect the LLMs natural-language responses to each of these prompts, then use a separate LLM(in our case, GPT-4) to determine which response is most positive for each poem. (See Appendix Afor further details of this evaluation procedure.) This allows us to calculate like feedback positivity,which is the frequency at which the like prefix feedback is more positive than the base feedback, anddislike feedback positivity, which is the frequency at which the dislike prefix feedback is more positivethan the base feedback. If a model is non-sycophantic, it will not change the tone of its responses based on user opinions andtherefore should exhibit similar frequencies of like and dislike feedback positivity. Conversely, amaximally sycophantic model will base its evaluations entirely upon user opinions, exhibiting a likefeedback positivity of 100% and a dislike feedback positivity of 0%. Moderately sycophantic modelsexist between these two extremes. This allows us to evaluate the baseline sycophancy of models, aswell as gauge the effectiveness of our intervention for reducing sycophancy.",
  "Reducing sycophancy": "The first step in our method for reducing sycophancy is to train a probe that takes RM activations asinput and outputs a real-valued sycophancy score. Specifically, we train a fully connected layer as aclassifier using a sigmoid activation function to distinguish between sycophantic and non-sycophanticanswers. The probes input is the RM activations when evaluating the LLMs response. Duringinference, we remove the sigmoid activation function to produce a symmetrical and continuoussycophancy score where positive values correspond to a sycophantic answer and negative valuescorrespond to non-sycophantic answers. Training this classifier requires a dataset of prompts and LLM responses that are labeled as eithersycophantic or non-sycophantic. We use four training datasets for this purpose. Two of our datasetsconsist of multiple choice questions, so the probes input is the activations corresponding to theLLMs single-token multiple choice response. The other two datasets contain open-ended questions,so the probes input is the average of the activations across all tokens of the LLMs response. Weprovide detailed descriptions and examples of these datasets in Appendix B.",
  "Experimental procedure": "Models and datasetsWe run experiments using Starling models and UltraRM , sincethese are some of the most capable LLMs that still have open-source reward models. Zhu et al. provide Starling-RM, a 7B parameter reward model fine-tuned from Llama2-7B-chat on a syntheticpreference dataset, and Starling-LM, a language model based on OpenChat-3.5 and fine-tunedon Starling-RM. We present the results of the experiments done on Starling-RM in Appendix D. Cuiet al. provide UltraRM, which is a reward model fine-tuned from Llama2-13B on human andsynthetic preference datasets. For text generation, we use OpenChat-3.5 , a high-performingopen-source LLM. We use a variety of multiple-choice and free-response datasets, as described inAppendix B. Surrogate rewardWe train a probe to identify sycophantic behavior and then calculate a surrogatereward using the general methodology outlined in .2. The resulting probe generalizes wellto unseen data (the POLI dataset) and effectively evaluates responses to unseen open-ended questions.For further details and intermediate analyses of the probe training process, see Appendix C. Lambda hyperparameterWe set the hyperparameter in Equation 1 such that the original rewardR(t) is weighted more heavily than the sycophancy score S(t). Specifically, we construct a calibrationdataset Tc of poems. For each poem t Tc, we use OpenChat-3.5 to generate 32 base feedbackresponses as described in .1, indexed by i {1, ..., 32}. We compute the sycophancy scoreSi(t) and reward Ri(t) for each response. We then calculate the standard deviations S(t) and R(t)over the i responses for each poem t. We set such that EtTc[ S(t)] = 0.75 EtTc[R(t)],where EtTc denotes the expectation over all poems in Tc. Best-of-N optimizationWe optimize against the surrogate reward R(t) defined in Equation 1 usingBest-of-N (BoN) sampling. For each question, we generate integer N (1, 32) completions usingOpenChat-3.5 and select the highest-scoring one. Optimization strength increases as N increases.",
  "The learned sycophancy score appears to track the sycophancy of individual tokens, while optimizingagainst the surrogate reward effectively reduces sycophantic behavior": "Token-wise sycophancyTo ensure the probe accurately captures relevant information while avoid-ing spurious features associated with sycophancy (such as agreement), we visualize the sycophancyscore for each token in the LLMs response. shows a non-cherry-picked example in whichtokens relating to the non-sycophantic answer (in this case, true to your values, authenticity, andintegrity) have the lowest token-wise sycophancy scores. This provides qualitative evidence that theprobe accurately tracks sycophancy. Sycophantic behaviorWe evaluate sycophantic behavior using the like feedback positivity anddislike feedback positivity measures introduced in .1. Let the positivity gap be the differencebetween like and dislike feedback positivity. The larger the positivity gap, the more the LLMsresponse is influenced by user sentiment, and the greater the sycophancy. shows how thepositivity gap changes as optimization pressure (N) increases. When optimizing against the base : Vizualisation of the sycophancy score (number in parenthesis) of a non-sycophanticanswer to the question: \"Is it better to stick to your true values or adapt them to reduce conflict withothers?\".

Theseexperiments are performed on 300 poems and the confidence bands correspond to the 95% confidenceinterval. The answers are optimized against the base UltraRM reward model and its surrogate reward.We observe that the surrogate reward reduces sycophancy, whereas the base reward increases it.",
  "Conclusion": "We introduce an approach to identify and penalize sycophancy in the reward model. Our experi-ments demonstrate the probes ability to accurately measure information relevant to sycophancy.Additionally, we show that optimizing against the constructed surrogate reward effectively reducessycophantic behaviors. Moreover, this methodology is applicable to other undesirable LLM behaviors.By creating targeted, small labeled datasets that elicit specific unwanted behaviors, we can trainprobes to identify these traits as demonstrated here, then modify the reward model to explicitlypenalize such behaviors. Limitations and future workThis approach has a few limitations. Levinstein & Herrmann have found that probes can be brittle, so further work is needed to evaluate their robustness andgeneralizability. Moreover, this approach requires access to the base reward model, which isntavailable for many state-of-the-art LLMs. However, we believe that this approach holds great promiseand plan to develop it further. In future research we plan to apply it to a wider range of behaviors,and investigate tradeoffs between control and performance.",
  "Social Impacts Statement": "Sycophantic behavior may spread misinformation or reinforce harmful beliefs, and existing alignmenttechniques such as RLHF are insufficient to mitigate it. We seek to fill this gap by proposing astraightforward method to identify and reduce sycophancy and other problematic LLM behaviors.This work contributes to societally responsible AI development by addressing unwanted behaviorswhile promoting more reliable and fact-based interactions. It also underscores the importance ofaugmenting RLHF with additional techniques to ensure more robust alignment.",

Two hypotheses might explain that Starling-RM doesnt incentivize sycophancy. Firstly, sinceStarling-RM is trained exclusively on synthetic preference datasets, it might not prioritize sycophanticanswers due to the lack of direct human bias, leading to a reward model that does not favor sycophanticresponses. This hypothesis is nuanced, considering that the language model responsible for generatingthe synthetic dataset exhibited a propensity towards sycophancy as well . Secondly, Starling-RM might be too small and not capable enough to learn favoring sycophantic answers effectively.This challenge is compounded by the inherent competition between sycophancy and the objective oftruthfulness, which is probably more salient in the preference dataset.

We think that this is because the questionconstruction is inherently more confusing its pretty unusual to label the first alternative (B) andthe second one (A) in a multiple-choice question. These results are surprising, as far as we know,humans dont tend to prefer choices labeled B, so were not sure where this could have come from inthe training data. As humans, it initially didnt even occur to us to look for it.",
  ". Llama2 is confidently accurate (most of the confidence scores are close to 1)2. Llama2 is consistent across classes (the red and green distributions are similar)": "This is indeed the pattern we observe in figure 13 with this new prompt. The distribution is now muchmore balanced. Positive comments (green) are correctly identified 75% of the time, while negativecomments (red) are accurately classified 96% of the time, in comparison to 100% and 15% with ouroriginal prompt. This is closer to what wed expect from a relatively competent model like Llama2.No longer using A and B to label our alternatives has removed the bias, therefore we will use thisfinal prompt format for our filtration process. : Distribution of confidence scores for the prompt: (P) Positive - (N) Negative. With thisprompt template, Llama2 has good confidence scores for most of the snippets regardless of theirground truth sentiments."
