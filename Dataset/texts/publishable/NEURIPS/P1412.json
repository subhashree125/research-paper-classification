  "Abstract": "The alignment of large language models (LLMs) is critical for developing effectiveand safe language models. Traditional approaches focus on aligning modelsduring the instruction tuning or reinforcement learning stages, referred to in thispaper as post alignment. We argue that alignment during the pre-training phase,which we term native alignment, warrants investigation. Native alignment aimsto prevent unaligned content from the beginning, rather than relying on post-hoc processing. This approach leverages extensively aligned pre-training data toenhance the effectiveness and usability of pre-trained models. Our study specificallyexplores the application of native alignment in the context of Arabic LLMs. Weconduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to evaluate the impact ofnative alignment on model performance and alignment stability. Additionally, werelease open-source Arabic LLMs that demonstrate state-of-the-art performance onvarious benchmarks, providing significant benefits to the Arabic LLM community. 1",
  "Introduction": "The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is a crucial component inthe development of effective and safe language models for downstream tasks . While mostexisting studies focus on alignment during the instruction tuning phase or the reinforcementlearning stage , they often overlook the pre-training stage. Unlike the common practiceof aligning LLMs during instruction tuning or reinforcement learning phase, referred to as postalignment, in this paper, we delve into the relatively unexplored research area of model alignmentduring the pre-training stage. We term this concept native alignment, with the goal of enhancingthe effectiveness and usability of LLMs during pre-training, a phase that utilizes a significant amountof data for next-token prediction training . Post alignment, the conventional approach to human preference alignment 2 typically conducted afterthe models pre-training stage, is widely used in LLM development. Its effectiveness has been verified These authors contributed equally to this work.Benyou Wang is the corresponding author.1Our code is available at preference alignment aims to ensure AI outputs reflect human values and preferences .This is typically evaluated by crowd workers who compare model outputs and indicate their preferences basedon three key aspects: accuracy, fluency, and safety. Accuracy refers to the relevance and usefulness of the answer,",

  ": Comparison of pre-training data quality before and after data alignment rewriting": "by many previous studies . However, the alignment process presents two main challenges: (1)the difficulty of collecting high-quality data, and (2) a lack of stability . The superficialalignment hypothesis suggests that a models knowledge and capabilities are learned almost entirelyduring pre-training, while alignment teaches it which sub-distribution of formats should be used wheninteracting with users . Based on this hypothesis, we posit that native alignment (deep alignment),conducted during the pre-training stage and due to its extensive quantity, can alleviate the stress ofpost-alignment (superficial alignment) and improve the degree of alignment in LLMs. In this study, we introduce a novel data-centric alignment method for the pre-training phase of LLMs,which we term as native alignment. Our focus is primarily on the Arabic language and culture, andwe carry out extensive experiments and evaluations from various perspectives to demonstrate theeffectiveness of our proposed method. We also conduct ablation studies to delve deeper into thecomplexities of pre-training alignment, thereby offering valuable insights for future research in thisfield. Furthermore, we make available two pre-trained Arabic LLMs that deliver state-of-the-artperformance on benchmarks, reinforcing the efficacy of our pre-training alignment strategy. The keycontributions of our work are as follows:",
  "Training": "AnnotatedData Pairs RewriteLLMs Polishing Instructions: - If there are no errors, output the text directly.- For longer texts, retain as much information as possible...- Output in Markdown format if necessary...- Modify only the parts that are clearly inappropriate...- Avoid taking sides in controversial issues as much...- Correct any statements involving religious taboos...- Ensure the output is fluent, correcting any punctuation...- Remove any content that is clearly advertising... ...",
  ": Demonstration of pre-training data processing workflow for native alignment": "Step 2: Annotation We employ a data rewriting technique to align the pre-training data. In thisstage, given a set of code of conduct (i.e., polishing instructions) that outlines the expected behaviorof LLMs, we randomly select a subset of pre-training data for an alignment expert to rewrite inaccordance with these instructions3. Step 3: Training Considering the large volume of data involved in the pre-training stage of LLMs,it is both inefficient and costly to utilize senior experts for such extensive data processing. Instead,we train a group of smaller LLMs on the annotated alignment data pairs.",
  "Step 4. Rewriting: With the trained alignment workers, we can process the vast pre-training dataeffectively. Ultimately, this process can yield a large quantity of rewritten alignment data": "As shown in , for the alignment code of conduct part, we prefer to focus more on the fourcommon issues identified in the actual data. These issues are further detailed in the PolishingInstructions, located on the left side of : 1. Format Issues: A common problem with web-crawled data is its format. Text formattingcan easily be disrupted by code or web indentation. Therefore, this rule involves correctingany punctuation and formatting errors, as well as any grammatical or syntactic mistakes.",
  "Preliminary Analysis on Alignment Data": "In this section, we conduct two pilot studies on alignment data alone, without the use of LLMs, topreliminarily verify whether the data processing workflow meets the expectations. Specifically, werandomly select and process 8k Arabic data points from a publicly available dataset 4 to compose thetest dataset used for our pilot studies. The first pilot study focuses on toxicity detection, while thesecond one delves into perplexity analysis.",
  "The alignment expert could be either a human or an expert LLM.4ArabicText 2022:": "Toxicity DetectionReferring to the work of Gehman et al. , it is suggested that thepresence of offensive and toxic content in pre-training datasets can result in a phenomenon known astoxic degeneration. This means that pre-trained LLMs can generate toxic text even from seeminglyharmless prompts. In response to this, we utilize a publicly available moderation tool, OpenAIModeration, developed by OpenAI 5 to assess the safety of pre-training data before and after theprocess of alignment rewriting. As demonstrated in , we observe that across the selectedfour aspects listed, the rewritten data consistently exhibits less score of toxicity compared to theoriginal data on average. Specifically, there is a reduction of 31.82% in sexual content, 26.87% inhate speech, 20.82% in harassment, and 16.54% in violent content. These findings indicate that ourproposed pre-training alignment data processing workflow effectively mitigates the toxicity levels inthe datasets across the aforementioned aspects. <44-88-1212-1616-20>20",
  ": Perplexity before and after nativealignment of Arabic data": "Perplexity AnalysisPre-training data pruning demonstrated that simple data pruning using perplex-ity metrics surpasses other more computationally de-manding scoring methods. This approach can curatehigh-quality corpora and enhance model training per-formance with less data. In accordance with the pa-per, we calculate the perplexity metric as follows toevaluate the quality of the alignment data:",
  "NLL (tj) = log P (tj | t<j; )": "A lower perplexity indicates that a sentence is more likely according to the models. We calculateperplexity on the previously mentioned 8k curated test dataset for Llama-3-8B , both before andafter rewriting. As shows, the rewritten data generally has a lower perplexity score comparedto the original data. This further demonstrates the effectiveness of the alignment rewriting process inimproving data fluency.",
  "Experiments: Practical Applications in Arabic": "To further validate the effectiveness of native alignment, we focus on Arabic, a language that posessignificant challenges due to its unique cultural values , which differ from mainstream Easternand Western norms. Besides, our approach is particularly suitable for low-resource languages. Forlanguages with ample resources, discarding unaligned data is often more practical than adapting it,given the high costs of transformation. In Arabic, with its limited data, its essential to preserve andutilize what is available, even if it is unaligned.",
  "Experiment Settings": "Utilizing the Llama-3 series of model checkpoints, we apply native alignment subsequent tothe conventional pre-training stage and build up two aligned Arabic pre-trained models, namelyLLaMA3-Tamed-8B and LLaMA3-Tamed-70B. Evaluations carried out on various mainstreamArabic benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our constructed models, surpassingstate-of-the-art models in multiple aspects. BenchmarksTo thoroughly evaluate the trained model from various angles, as listed on the rightof , we select the following Arabic benchmarks: (1) Knowledge assessment: We choose Ara-bicMMLU , and EXAMS , which provide a comprehensive evaluation of knowledge acrossvarious subjects. These benchmarks focus on factual correctness and subject-specific knowledge, ensuring that the model demonstrates breadth and depth in its understanding of different domains. (2)Arabic localization: We use ACVA , a benchmark specifically designed to assess how well themodel aligns with Arabic culture, values, and societal norms. This evaluates the models capacityto generate culturally appropriate and contextually relevant content, which is crucial for modelsdeployed in localized environments. (3) Trustworthiness: Trustworthiness is inherently a qualitativemeasure, but AraTrust quantifies this by evaluating various dimensions such as truthfulness,ethical behavior, safety, and fairness. AraTrust includes detailed assessments related to physical andmental health, privacy, and avoidance of offensive or illegal content, providing a structured frameworkfor evaluating trust in language models. BaselinesWe have selected several high-performing models as baselines for comparison. To ensurea fair comparison, we have divided these models into three groups. The first group comprises open-source models with fewer than 10 billion parameters, including Llama3-8B , Qwen1.5-7B .The second group consists of open-source models with more than 10 billion parameters, includingJais-30B-v1 , Qwen1.5-32B , Qwen1.5-72B and Llama3-70B . The final groupincludes closed-source LLMs such as ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 6. SlimPajama 16.0% MAP-CC16.0% ArabicText2022 38.0% Wikipedia15.5% Proof-Pile-2 14.5%",
  "Data CompositionThe data used for continued pre-training has two types:": "Pre-training data: To mimic real-world model training scenarios, we combine pre-trainingdatasets from multiple sources, shown on the left of . For language datasets, weselect ArabicText2022 from BAAI7 for Arabic, SlimPajama for English, MAP-CC for Chinese, and various other language datasets from Wikipedia . For mathematics andcode, we choose Proof-Pile-2 . Native-alignment data: We adhere to the data processing workflow outlined in and rewrite 10 billion tokens data randomly sampled from ArabicText2022, creating anArabic native-alignment dataset. Specifically, we utilized GPT-4 as an alignment expert togenerate 10k expert alignment data for alignment worker training, in this case, we employedQwen1.5-4B-Chat , taking into account both speed and quality. Training and Evaluation Details(1) Training Details: We performed continued pre-training onLlama-3-8B and Llama-3-70B respectively, using the mixed-source pre-trained datasets comprising atotal of 100 billion tokens. Following the traditional pre-training phase, we carry out native-alignmenttraining with the 10 billion tokens from the processed Arabic alignment dataset. (2) EvaluationDetails:For ArabicMMLU , we use the code from the original paper. For the remainingbenchmarks, we adhere to the original paper and carried out evaluations on the evaluationframework . And, we use Opencompass framework to evaluate LLMs on the AraTrustBenchmark 8.",
  "Results and Analysis": "As depicted in , the LLaMA3-Tamed-8B and LLaMA3-Tamed-70B models, which are trainedon a combination of mixed-source pre-training data and a set of native-alignment Arabic data, exhibitsuperior performance in comparison to the baseline models. In terms of knowledge benchmarks suchas ArabicMMLU, and EXAMS, LLaMA3-Tamed-70B surpasses the baselines, with the exceptionof GPT4. For the Trustworthiness evaluation, namely AraTrust, the enhancements in LLaMA3-Tamed show significant improvement, increasing from 60.54 in Llama3-70B to 63.41 after training.The models trained with native alignment outperform other open-source LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance across several benchmarks, including knowledge, Arabic localization andtrustworthiness 9.",
  "More Studies on Native Alignment": "To further investigate native alignment, we introduce the general experimental settings for alignmentin .1, where we systematically compare the alignment among mainstream Arabic LLMs.Building on these settings, we conduct two studies to explore how to effectively utilize collectednative-alignment data in terms of strategy and scaling law. This forms two Research Questions(RQs):",
  "Benchmarking Harmlessness and Helpfulness": "Benchmark (BeaverTails)The BeaverTails dataset comprises 700 prompts specificallydesigned to provoke offensive responses from models, thereby assessing their alignment performance.After the comparative models generate responses to the prompts, GPT-4 will be used to evaluate thesegenerated contents, assessing the harmlessness and helpfulness of the models. Detailed calculationmethods and evaluation prompts are provided in Appendix B. Besides that, due to the issue of PositionBias in GPT-4, the answers of the LLMs are arranged in various orders, and the average scoresobtained from these arrangements are recorded as the final results. Training DetailsSince the evaluation dataset consists of question-answer pairs, the model underevaluation needs to undergo the supervised fine-tuning process to acquire conversational capabilities.Therefore, to obtain more reliable experimental results, the candidate pre-trained models are trained",
  "An additional experiment in Appendix E shows that native alignment demonstrates strong generalisabilityto other languages beyond Arabic": "on an instruction fine-tuning dataset Alpaca-Arabic-GPT4 10 which contains 50K samples, enablingthem to develop normal conversational abilities that align with the evaluation plan. The proportionsand volumes of these datasets vary according to the goals of the ablation studies, with specific detailsprovided in the corresponding subsections of the studies. Definition of Training StrategyFor simplicity, the term Pre-train-12B is used to denote the modeltrained on the original unaligned pre-training dataset with 12 billion tokens. Align-12B refers to themodel trained on an aligned pre-training dataset with 12 billion tokens. SFT-50K indicates trainingon the instruction tuning dataset with 50K samples. Baselines for Arabic LLMs Among the currently popular open-source LLMs, those with strongcapabilities in the Arabic language include Jais , AceGPT , and Llama-3 . In thisexperiment, base models are directly employed to generate responses on the BeaverTails dataset forevaluating their safety and usefulness. This aims to explore the degree of value alignment in differentArabic pre-trained language models. We employed ChatGPT-4o as the baseline model, assessing theperformance of other models by comparing their harmlessness and helpfulness ratios relative to thebaseline. Jais-13BAceGPT-7BLlama3-8BLlama3-8B (Pre-train-12B) (Align-12B) ChatGPT-4o(Baseline) Trained Alignment Data (tokens) Ratios (vs. ChatGPT-4o) 17.0% 28.6% 51.2% 61.6% 100.0% 21.1% 26.1% 72.3% 77.1% 100.0%HarmlessnessHelpfulness",
  ": The ratio of metrics for base models relativeto ChatGPT-4o on the BeaverTails dataset": "Benchmarking resultsThe experimen-tal results in indicate that Llama-3-8B surpasses other pre-trained mod-els in both harmlessness and helpfulness,suggesting that it is originally trained ona highly secure dataset aligned with hu-man values. Despite the relatively smallerroom for improvement in Llama-3, westill opt to use native alignment to furtherenhance the models safety and reliabil-ity in Arabic. To comprehensively assessthe effectiveness of the alignment method,the optimal results achieved through na-tive alignment in the ablation experimentare prominently displayed. These resultsdemonstrate that our method significantlyenhances the models harmlessness andhelpfulness, with observed improvementsof 10.4% and 4.8% respectively. This enhancement not only makes the model safer but also ensures itis more closely aligned with human values, thus highlighting the substantial impact of our alignmentstrategy on improving model behavior.",
  "Native Alignment vs. Conventional Pre-training (RQ 1)": "To clarify the effectiveness of native alignment over conventional pre-training, we conduct a simpleablation study on Llama-3-8B to compare the performance of different data composition settingson the same LLM. The first setting uses only the original unaligned pre-training data, as is typicalin most pre-training work. The second setting uses the same quantity of data but replaces it withalignment data collected specifically for model training 11. The third setting involves training onalignment data following the training on the original data. As shown in the left histogram in , using the first setting as a baseline, the other two settingsshow significant improvements in both harmlessness and helpfulness, indicating the enhancementbrought by the alignment data for the base models safety and knowledge. Furthermore, the settingthat trains on alignment data after the original data outperforms training solely on alignment data.This demonstrates that the two different pre-training data settings are not conflicting but rathermutually beneficial.",
  "Baseline": "4.5B6B7.5B (All models were then fine-tuned on a 50K SFT dataset) 9B10.5B12B Trained Alignment Data (tokens) -1.0% +1.0% +3.0% +5.0% +7.0% Improvement (vs. baseline) HarmlessnessHelpfulness : The left graph illustrates the metric improvements under various training trategies. Theright graph demonstrates the performance gains as the volume of alignment data increases. In bothgraphs, the baseline model, Pre-train-12B + SFT-50K, is initially trained on 12 billion tokens froman unaligned dataset and later fine-tuned using instruction-tuning datasets with 50,000 samples. Based on these simple experiments, we can conclude that: (1) Native alignment indeed bringsimprovements to the base model pre-training in both harmlessness and helpfulness aspects comparedto conventional pre-training data. (2) There is a mutual promotion between alignment data and normalpre-training data. The experimental results show that using both types of data in model pre-trainingcan achieve the best utilization of the collected data.",
  "Scaling law of Native Alignment (RQ 2)": "Compared to instruction tuning and reinforcement learning, the volume of pre-training data is usuallyquite large. This leads to a pertinent question: is it necessary to bear substantial costs to realign theentire pre-training corpus? Alternatively, does the alignment process hit a plateau once a certaindata volume is reached? To explore this topic in-depth, an experiment is conducted by using a modelinitially trained on an original dataset with 12 billion tokens as the baseline. We then increase thevolume of the aligned dataset to obtain multiple models and subsequently fine-tune these modelsusing the instruction tuning dataset. This experiment is designed to explore the scaling laws of aligneddatasets, offering insights for future proportions of rewritten datasets. According to the results shown in the right bar graph of , models trained initially withoutaligned data exhibit increasing levels of harmlessness and helpfulness as the amount of alignmentdata is augmented. Additionally, the trends observed in the results indicate that the increase inharmlessness is gradual, which may be due to Llama-3 already being a model that excels inaligning with human values, thus showing relatively less significant improvements in harmlessness.On the other hand, helpfulness rises sharply with the increase in the volume of alignment data, andthis rate of increase continues to accelerate. So, based on the result, we can understand that: the alignment dataset plays a crucial role incontinuously refining the models values. By expanding the volume of the alignment dataset, themodel becomes safer and more helpful, ultimately enhancing its ability to generate responses thatalign closely with human values.",
  "Pre-training Data Processing": "Pre-training data processing plays a crucial role in enhancing language model performance andexpanding applicability across various tasks. Studies such as Penedo et al. demonstrate theadvantages of web-mined data over traditional corpora through advanced processing techniques likededuplication, language identification, and quality filtering, resulting in significant performance gains.Similarly, works by Gunasekar et al. and others highlight that combining LLM-basedfiltering of web data with synthetic data generation enables smaller models to achieve performancetypically seen in larger counterparts, though the computational overhead can limit its broader use. Several studies, including Raffel et al. and Kreutzer et al. , emphasize the importance of dataquality for transfer learning and multilingual models. Raffel demonstrates that strategic preprocessingcan improve performance across tasks, while Kreutzers manual audit of web-crawled data revealsthe critical role of quality control in multilingual model robustness. Additionally, Maini et al. propose the Web Rephrase Augmented Pre-training (WRAP), where an instruction-tuned modelparaphrases web documents into different styles, effectively boosting pre-training efficiency, reducingperplexity, and enhancing zero-shot accuracy. When comparing data cleaning and native alignment, we observe that they serve different butcomplementary roles in language model development. Data cleaning efforts such as RefinedWeb ,SlimPajama , and WRAP focus on improving data quality by filtering, deduplicating, orreformatting web content into various stylistic formats like Wikipedia or question-answer. Theseconventional methods primarily remove low-quality content or polish data formats .In contrast, native alignment not only enhances data quality but also aligns the models outputswith human preferences, making it an extension of traditional cleaning processes. An experimentcomparing native alignment with conventional data cleaning (e.g., RefinedWeb) is presented inAppendix E.",
  "LLM Alignment": "Alignment refers to ensuring that LLMs act in accordance with user intentions, meaning they arehelpful, honest, and harmless . As shown by Wang et al. , aligning LLMs involves three keycomponents: data collection, training methodologies, and model evaluation. This is particularlyimportant because pre-training data can contain unaligned content, such as ethical issues or religioussensitivities, which may conflict with human values. This is especially critical in culturally sensitiveregions, such as the Arabic world. Many alignment methods focus on post-training adjustments, such as instruction tuning ,and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) . RLHF involves using humanfeedback to fine-tune models after pre-training, aligning them with user preferences to ensure theybehave appropriately. However, this process is resource-intensive, requiring extensive human input.To address this, RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback) proposes using LLM-generated feedback instead of human feedback, which has shown promising results in improvingscalability. The difference between post-alignment and native alignment lies in their timing and focus. Post-alignment, like RLHF, occurs after pre-training on both aligned and unaligned data, working tocorrect undesirable behavior. Native alignment, however, operates during the pre-training phase,filtering out unaligned content from the outset. By proactively preventing the inclusion of problematicdata, native alignment is often more efficient and cost-effective. As the saying goes, \"An ounce ofprevention is worth a pound of cure,\" indicating that addressing issues early in the process can reducethe complexity and cost of post-training corrections. A comparative experiment between native andpost-alignment methods is provided in Appendix D.",
  "Conclusion": "In this paper, we introduced native alignment, a novel approach for aligning LLMs with humanpreferences during the pre-training phase. Unlike traditional alignment strategies that occur duringinstruction tuning or reinforcement learning, known as post-alignment, our method integratesalignment processes earlier in the training pipeline. We outlined a comprmeiyehensive data processingworkflow that emphasizes knowledge preservation, content moderation, text fluency, and controversialissue avoidance. Through extensive experiments and evaluations focusing on the Arabic language,we demonstrated significant improvements in pre-training data quality, resulting in models that areboth safer and more helpful. Ablation studies confirmed that combining native alignment data withtraditional pre-training data yields superior results, enhancing the harmlessness and helpfulness ofmodels. Moreover, our practical application of this approach led to the development of the state-of-the-art Arabic LLM, LLaMA3-Tamed-70B. Together with the smaller version, LLaMA3-Tamed-8B, this advancement is highly beneficial for the Arabic LLM community. We are committed to furtheringresearch in this area and will open source our code, data and models to foster collaboration andinnovation within the community.",
  "Limitations": "Our work has limitations: (1) The absence of a suitable and fair benchmark for evaluating alignmentprevents direct comparison with existing post-alignment methods, which is why we did not use otherrelated alignment work as baselines. Our pre-training alignment method, unique in its applicationstage, does not interfere with other alignment methods, allowing for simultaneous coexistence withinthe same model. Despite this, we still conduct a simple experiment to compare post-alignmentapproaches and native alignment in an unfair, non-apple-to-apple setting for the readers reference,see Appendix D for more details. (2) Our case study focuses on Arabic LLMs, but the full potentialof the proposed approach, such as its instruction-following capabilities, remains untested as it is morerelated to the quality of instruction data rather than pre-training data. (3) Another limitation involveshallucinations. Although the overall hallucination ratio in our models outputs, where hallucinationsare inherited from the original data to the rewritten data, is found to be within acceptable boundsbased on a manual review of 90 sample pairs, addressing hallucinations in native alignment remains achallenge and is beyond the scope of this work. We plan to explore solutions for this issue in futurework.",

  "BDetails of Ablation Study Evaluation": "Translate into ArabicThe evaluation benchmark, the BeaverTails dataset, is in English. Toevaluate Arabic LLMs, we used Baidu translation API12 to translate the questions into Arabic. Thetranslation quality for all data was verified by one of the authors, a native Arabic speaker. Evaluation StrategyFollowing the experimental setup of the Aligner , GPT-4 is employed toevaluate the outputs of two models using the metrics of Harmlessness and Helpfulness to ascertainthe extent of alignment with human values and whether the alignment compromises the inherenthelpfulness of the models. GPT-4 utilizes the prompts from Figures 8 and 9 to assess these metricsand the rates are calculated using the formula:",
  "D.1Experiment Settings": "We utilized the LLaMA-Factory framework , employing LLaMA3-Tamed-8B as the backbonefor the experimental group focusing on native alignment, and Llama3-8B as the control group. Weperformed instruction tuning on both pre-trained models using an Arabic supervised fine-tuning (SFT)dataset 13, resulting in the fine-tuned models named LLaMA3-Tamed-8B (Native Alignment + SFT)and Llama3-8B (SFT). For post-alignment, we selected DPO training as a representative approach,using an Arabic preference dataset 14. Post-alignment is conducted on both chat models, namelyLLaMA3-Tamed-8B (Native Alignment + SFT + DPO) and Llama3-8B (Native Alignment + DPO).The batch size was set to 128 for both instruction tuning and DPO, with epochs set to 3. All otherexperimental settings followed the default settings in the framework. We evaluated the performance",
  "**Criteria for rewriting**:": "- **Grammar and Syntax**:Revise the text to ensure it adheres to standard grammaticalrules and language norms of Arabic.- **Cultural Appropriateness**: Identify and exclude any content that is illegal or culturally offensivein Arabic contexts.- **Noise**: Remove extraneous elements such as advertisements, web links, Garbled Characters,URLs, and any irrelevant content from the text. If the entire text is junk content, discard the wholesegment.- **Consistency**: Ensuring consistency in language and style throughout the sentence.- **Mathematical Formula Formatting**: If there are mathematical formulas in the text, standardize theformatting of the formulas for clarity.- **Code Formatting**: If there is code in the text, standardize code snippets for readability.",
  "**Instructions**:": "1. Read the text carefully.2. Analyze the text against the listed criteria and output the analysis of the text.3. If the given paragraph is entirely incorrect and difficult to rewrite, the rewritten text directly outputNone.4. If there are no errors, the rewritten text directly output the content of the Arabic text.5. Please refer to the example to output the analysis and the rewritten text.6.

  "<System Prompt> You are a specialist in the domain of large language models, and presently,you are engaged in minimizing the toxicity and bias of large language models": "<User Prompt> In the following, I will present two responses from two large languagemodels to the same prompt. Please help me judge which response is more harmful ortoxic. To accurately determine the level of harmfulness or toxicity in the given responses,please analyze each response separately, focusing on specific language, tone, and contentthat could be interpreted as harmful or toxic. You will consider factors such as aggression,discrimination, misinformation, or any form of language that could be offensive or hurtfulto certain groups. The context provided by the prompt will also be taken into account toensure a comprehensive understanding of the responses. Based on this analysis, you willconclude which response is more harmful, or if they are equally harmful. The goal is to makea clear and reasoned determination, leaning towards distinguishing differences in harm levelswherever possible. Output your result in the following format: if responseA is more harmful,return - More harmful: [[responseA]], if responseB is more harmful, then return - Moreharmful: [[responseB]], if they are equally harmful, then return - More harmful: [[Equal]].Please judiciously determine that the two are equal, and make as many determinations aspossible that they are not equal. <Prompt>: prompt <responseA>: responseA <responseB>:responseB",

  "E.1Experiment Settings": "We implement the native alignment approach in this experiment, as mentioned earlier. For this, GPT-4is employed to rewrite 4,300 seed data samples randomly selected from the pre-training corpus,RefinedWeb . This rewritten data is then used to fine-tune a pre-trained model (Qwen-1.5-4B-Chat ), serving as the rewrite LLM. Subsequently, this LLM is used to rewrite an additional14,600 pre-training data samples, also randomly sampled from RefinedWeb. Continued pre-training isconducted on Qwen-1.5-0.5B using both the original RefinedWeb data and the aligned data, resultingin models designated as Qwen-1.5-0.5B-refinedWeb and Qwen-1.5-0.5B-aligned. Evaluation isperformed using the MMLU benchmark .",
  "FAdditional Experiment III: Seed Data Selection": "To investigate the impact of seed data selection on the performance of the trained alignment model,we conducted an additional experiment. This experiment aimed to explore how the choice of seedalignment data influences model performance. We compared the performance of models trained onrandomly selected alignment seed data with those trained on data from specific experimental groups.",
  ". Experiment Group 2 (low-ppl): This group consisted of data with minimal differencesbetween the original and rewritten texts, according to text perplexity score, indicating nosignificant changes": "3. Baseline (random): We conducted three random sample seed data experiments to accountfor randomness, labeled as random-1, random-2, and random-3. The variance andaverage of these experiments are reported as random (x3). All datasets consisted of 1,000 samples of pre-training data and were trained on Llama-3-8B. GPT-4is used as a reviewer to evaluate the rewriting quality of the alignment workers trained on differentseed data settings, using the prompt shown in .",
  ": Comparison data quality assessment results based on different seed data selection strategies": "The results indicate that, in the benchmark, the selection of aligned data can influence performance(high-PPL). All three random experiments showed no significant differences compared to each otheron the benchmark. Therefore, a preliminary conclusion can be drawn: data selection may improvethe native alignment approach. This suggests an interesting direction for future research."
