  "Introduction": "Recently, makeup transfer has become a popular application in social media and the virtual world.With its significant economic potential in e-commerce and entertainment, this technique is attractingwidespread attention from the computer vision and artificial intelligence communities. Given a pairof source and reference face images, makeup transfer involves simultaneously focusing on the realismof the transferred result, the content preservation of the source image, and the makeup fidelity of thereference image. Although previous approaches have made significant advances in image realism and content preservation , the challenge of achievinghigh-fidelity transfer of various makeup styles still remains unsolved. The difficulties of makeup transfer mainly stem from two aspects. On the one hand, makeup transferis essentially an unsupervised task, which means that there are no real transferred images that can beused as labeled targets for model training. To address this issue, previous methods typically synthesizea \"pseudo\" ground truth from each input source-reference image pair, as an alternative supervision",
  "(a) Sub-optimal Pseudo-paired Data(b) Ambiguity in Preserving Source Contents": ": Illustration of two main difficulties in the makeup transfer task. (a) Due to the absenceof paired data, previous methods utilize histogram matching or geometric distortion to synthesizesub-optimal pseudo-paired data, which inevitably misguide the model training. (b) Some sourcecontent details should be preserved in simple makeup styles but be removed in complex ones.",
  ": In addition to color matching, our approach allows flexible control to preserve or discardtexture details for various makeup styles, without changing the facial shape": "signal. However, as shown in (a), current pseudo-paired data synthesis techniques, includinghistogram matching and geometric distortion , fail to produce desirable outcomes.The reason is that histogram-matching-based methods often ignore the spatial properties of makeupstyles, thus generating over-smoothed targets that lose most makeup details. And since the warpingprocess in geometric-distortion-based methods relies solely on the shape information (e.g., faciallandmarks) of input images, their pseudo targets usually contain undesired artifacts. Consequently,these sub-optimal pseudo-paired data will inevitably misguide the model training. This eventuallyresults in the fact that most existing methods generally exhibit low makeupfidelity, especially for those images with complex makeup details. On the other hand, the diversity of different makeup styles can also lead to ambiguity in preservingsource contents. In practice, makeup styles can range from natural, barely-there looks to elaborateand dramatic ones, each having a different impact on the person face. As shown in (b), thecontent details of a source face (e.g., freckles and eyelashes) usually should be preserved in a simplemakeup style, while they may be obscured in some complex ones due to the heavy use of cosmetics.An ideal model should be flexible enough to preserve or discard those source content details accordingto user preferences. However, all the previous approaches overlook this requirement. To address the aforementioned dilemmas, we propose a novel Self-supervised Hierarchical MakeupTransfer (SHMT) method, which is built on the recent latent diffusion models . For the firstproblem, considering the unsupervised nature of makeup transfer, we develop a self-supervisedlearning strategy following a \"decoupling-and-reconstruction\" paradigm. Specifically, given a faceimage, SHMT first extracts its content and makeup representations, and then simulates the makeuptransfer procedure by reconstructing the original input from these decoupled information. In SHMT,the content representation of a face image includes its 3D shape and texture details, while theassociated makeup representation is captured by destroying the content information from the inputimage through using random spatial transformations. In this way, SHMT works in a self-supervisedmanner, thus eliminating the misguidance of pseudo-paired data. To address the second issue, we introduce a Laplacian pyramid to hierarchically decompose the texture information in input image,allowing SHMT to flexibly control the preservation or discard of these content details for variousmakeup styles, as illustrated in . Additionally, we propose an Iterative Dual Alignment (IDA)module in conjunction with the stepwise denoising property of diffusion models. In each denoisingstep, IDA utilizes the intermediate result to dynamically adjust the injection condition, which willhelp to correct the alignment errors caused by the domain gaps between the content and makeuprepresentations. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose a novel makeup transfer method, named SHMT, which employs a self-supervisedlearning strategy for model training, thus getting rid of the misleading pseudo-pairing dataadopted by previous methods.",
  "A Laplacian pyramid is introduced to hierarchically characterize the texture information,enabling SHMT to flexibly process these content details for various makeup styles": "A new Iterative Dual Alignment (IDA) module is proposed, which dynamically adjusts theinjection condition in each denoising step, such that the alignment errors caused by thedomain gaps between the content and makeup representations can be corrected. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results indicate that SHMT outperforms other state-of-the-art makeup transfer methods. And additionally, the ablation studies demonstrate therobustness and the generalization ability of our SHMT method.",
  "Makeup Transfer": "Over the past decade, makeup transfer has gained increasing attention in the field ofcomputer vision. BeautyGAN designs a histogram matching loss and a dual input/output GAN to simultaneously perform makeup transfer and removal. PairedCycleGAN trains additionalstyle discriminators to measure the local makeup similarity between the results and reference images.BeautyGlow decomposes the latent vectors of face images derived from the Glow frameworkinto makeup and nonmakeup latent vectors. To address misaligned head poses and facial expressions,PSGAN utilizes an attention mechanism to adaptively deform the makeup feature mapsbased on source images, while SCGAN encodes component-wise makeup regions into spatially-invariant style codes. RamGAN and SpMT explore local attention to eliminate potentialassociations between different makeup components. Considering that histogram matching discardsthe spatial properties of the makeup styles, FAT and SSAT design a pseudo-paired datasynthesis based on geometric distortion. EleGANt proposes a more effective pseudo-paired databy assigning varying weights to above two synthesis methods for performance improvement. Forcomplex makeup styles, LAND leverages multiple overlapping local makeup style discriminatorsto focus on the high-frequency makeup details. Additionally, CPM applies a segmentation modelto predict the mask of the makeup pattern. This segmented pattern is then pasted into semanticallyidentical locations using UV space. Due to the unsupervised nature of makeup transfer, most of the above methods synthesize pseudo-paired data to guide model training. In this strategy, the quality of these pseudo-paired data is critical,leading many works to strive for better synthesis techniques. With the help ofthe unprecedented generative capabilities of both GPT-4V and Stable Diffusion, a concurrent workStable-Makeup produces higher quality pseudo-paired data, thereby improving the performanceof makeup transfer. Unlike these methods, our approach works in a self-supervised manner andeliminates the need for cumbersome pseudo-paired data synthesis.",
  "Diffusion Models": "Diffusion models generate realistic images through an iterative inverse denoising process. Recently, ascompetitors to generative adversarial networks , diffusion models have shown significant progressin numerous generative tasks, including Text-to-Image (T2I) generation , controllableediting , and subject-driven or human-centric synthesis. DDPM proves the feasibility of recovering realistic images from random Gaussian noise. DDIM enables fast and deterministic inference by transforming the sampling process into a non-Markovian",
  "Hierarchical texture details": ": The framework of SHMT. A facial image I is decomposed into background area Ibg,makeup representation Im, and content representation (I3d, hi). The makeup transfer procedure issimulated by reconstructing the original image from these components. Hierarchica texture details hiare constructed to respond to different makeup styles. In each denoising step t, IDA draws on thenoisy intermediate result It to dynamically adjust the injection condition to correct alignment errors. process. To reduce computational complexity while retaining high quality and flexibility, LatentDiffusion Models (LDM) apply diffusion model training in the latent space of powerful pretrainedautoencoders. With training on large datasets, both Imagen and Stable Diffusio elevate T2Isynthesis to an unprecedented level. Inspired by the above approach, we delve into the makeup transfer task based on diffusion models.Compared to previous GAN-based makeup transfer methods, our approach eliminates the need foradversarial training and tedious loss function design, while delivering enhanced performance.",
  "Preliminary": "Our method is developed from Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) , which performs the diffusionprocess in the latent space to reduce the computational complexity of the model. In particular,LDM comprises three key components: an image encoder E, a decoder D, and an UNet denoiser .Firstly, the encoder E compresses an image I from the pixel space to a low-dimensional latent spacez0 = E(I), while the decoder D efforts to reconstruct the original image I from the latent variable z0(e.g. D(z0) = x0 I). Then, a UNet denoiser is trained to predict the applied noise in the latentspace. The optimization process can be defined as the following formulation:",
  "where zt is the noisy latent variable at the timestep t, c is the conditioned signal, is randomlysampled from the standard Gaussian distribution, and T is the defined maximum timestep": "During inference, zT is sampled from a random Gaussian distribution. The UNet denoiser theniteratively predicts the noise in the latent space at each timestep t and restores z0 via a samplingprocess (e.g. DDPM or DDIM). Finally, z0 is reconstructed by the decoder D to obtain thegenerated image. See for more details.",
  "Overview": "The goal of makeup transfer is to generate a new facial image that preserves the content information(e.g., background, facial structure, pose, expression) of a source image while applying the makeupstyle of a reference image. To achieve this, we propose SHMT, with its framework outlined in Figure 3. In SHMT, we craft a self-supervised strategy for model training in .3 and design anIterative Dual Alignment (IDA) module to correct alignment errors in .4. The training andinference process of SHMT is presented in .5.",
  "Self-supervised Strategy": "Following a \"decoupling-and-reconstruction\" paradigm, we craft a self-supervised strategy formakeup transfer. The main idea is to separate content and makeup representations from a facialimage, and then reconstruct the original image from these components. Foreground and background segmentation. Makeup transfer is a localized modification taskconfined to the facial area. As such, a pre-trained face parsing model is used to segment theforeground and background areas from the original image I. In makeup transfer, the background areaIbg (which includes hair and clothes) is a known component. Hence, the background area Ibg is inputto the latent diffusion model along with the noisy image It. The goal of the model is to inpaint theunknown facial area, using subsequent content and makeup representations as conditions. Makeup Representation. In our approach, the makeup representation is derived by destroyingthe images content information. Specifically, we apply a sequence of spatial transformations tothe foreground image Ifg. These transformations include random cropping, rotation, and elasticdistortion to create variation. As illustrated in , the distorted foreground image Im, whilelosing the majority of the content information, retains the makeup information well. In addition, thesetransformations effectively mimic semantic misalignment scenarios and facilitate the robustness ofthe model to poses and expressions .",
  "Content Representation. Inspired by physical face modeling , the content representationof a face is simplified into two main components: face shape and texture details": "Face Shape: The face shape, which determines the facial structure, head pose, and expression, is acrucial component to preserve during makeup transfer. In this context, a typical 3D face reconstructionmodel, known as 3DDFA-V2 , is employed to extract the face shape I3d from the original imageI. To match the resolution of the latent space of LDM, we perform a pixel unshuffle operation todownsample I3d. Texture Details: Texture details are incorporated to complement the excessively smooth face shape.Considering the ambiguity of texture detail preservation, the Laplace pyramid is introduced tobuild hierarchical texture details. To prevent color disturbances, the foreground image Ifg is firstconverted to a grayscale image Ifg of h w pixels. Then we downsample it by applying a fixedGaussian kernel to produce a low-pass prediction l1 Rh2 w 2 . The high-frequency component h0,which is treated as texture details, can be calculated as h0 = Ifg l1, where l1 is upsampled from l1.By replacing Ifg with l1 and repeating these operations, we obtain a series of hierarchical texturedetails [h0, h1, , hL], where L refers to the decomposition level of the Laplace pyramid. Thesetexture details, whose resolution gradually halves and ranges from fine to coarse, are illustrated in. If the resolution of the texture details exceeds that of the latent space, we downsample itusing a pixel unshuffle operation . Otherwise, the bilinear interpolation is used for upsampling. Note that only one texture detail hi is concatenated to the face shape I3d as a complete contentrepresentation. When hi is a fine texture detail, our model only needs to distill the low-frequencymakeup information from the makeup representation to reconstruct the image. This is suitable forsimple makeup styles. When hi is a coarse texture detail, our model must also distill the high-frequency makeup information from the makeup representation to ensure the recovery of the image.This is suitable for complex makeup styles.",
  "fc(i)2fm(j)2,(2)": "where fc = Ec(I3d, hi), fm = Em(E(Im)) denote the semantic features extracted by encoders Ecand Em. f(i) represents the feature vector of the i-th pixel in f and M(i, j) indicates the element atthe (i, j)-th location of M. We consider the correlation matrix M as a deformation mapping function,and use it to spatially deform the feature maps zm = E(Im) of makeup representations:",
  "jSoftmax(M(i, j)/) zm,(3)": "where Softmax() denotes a softmax computation along the column dimension, which normalizesthe element values in each row of M, and > 0 is a temperature parameter. Theoretically, thedeformed feature maps zm is semantically aligned with the content representation. However, due tothe domain gap between content and makeup representations, we find that alignment errors occurfrequently in zm. Considering the property that noisy intermediate result It is gradually movingcloser to the real image domain (e.g., the makeup representation domain), we propose a IterativeDual Alignment (IDA) module to address the above issue. At each timestep, it calculates an extraalignment prediction zm between the noisy intermediate result It and makeup representation Imto dynamically correct the previous alignment prediction zm. It is the result of It removing thebackground area. Since the noise degree of It is determined by timestep t, a MLP module predictsthe percentage w of two alignment predictions from timestep t:",
  "zm = (1 w)zm + wzm,(4)": "where w = MLP(t) and the MLP module consists of two fully connected layers and ends witha Sigmoid activation layer. Finally, the mixed prediction zm is concatenated with the contentrepresentation and injected into the denoisers encoder through a projection module consisting of1 1 convolution. In addition to correct alignment errors, IDA has two other advantages. First,because zm is semantically aligned with the content representation, IDA can control the makeupstyle in a spatially-aware manner. Corresponding results are displayed in the supplementary material.Second, IDA is relatively lightweight, with only approximately 11M parameters.",
  "Training and Inference": "During training, the parameters of the pre-trained autoencoder are fixed, the U-net denoiser andIDA module are jointly optimized from scratch under the original objective function in Equation 1.At inference, the model receives the background area Ibg and content representation (I3d and hi)from the source image, as well as the undeformed makeup representation Im from the referenceimage, to generate the makeup transfer result.",
  "Experimental settings": "Datasets. Following , we randomly select 90% of the images from the MT dataset astraining samples and the rest as test samples. In addition, Wild-MT and LADN datasetsare also used to validate the performance and generalization capability of our model. The images inthe Wild-MT dataset contain large pose and expression variations, and the LADN dataset collects anumber of images with complex makeup styles. Implementation Details. In our experiments, we discover that the autoencoder with a downsamplingfactor of 4 preserves texture details better than the one with a factor of 8. Therefore, the autoencoderwith a downsampling factor of 4 is selected, and the SHMT model is trained at a resolution of 256 256. The specific structure of the UNet denoiser remains the same as the LDM , with IDAmodule replacing the original conditional injection module. In Equation 3, is set to 100. We trainthe model with Adam optimizer, learning rate of 1e-6 and batch size of 16 on a single A100 GPU.Our model is trained for 250, 000 steps in about 5 days. For sampling, we utilize 50 steps of theDDIM sampler . Evaluation Metrics. In order to comprehensively and objectively compare the different methods,we choose three evaluation metrics, FID, CLS and Key-sim. Following , FID is calculatedbetween reference images and transferred results to indicate image realism. The lower the FID, the",
  ": Qualitative comparison with GAN-based baselines on complex makeup styles": "better. Recently, the work proves that the CLS token and the self-similarity of keys (abbreviatedas Key-sim) in DINOs feature space can represent the appearance and structure of an image,respectively. Inspired by this, we compute the cosine similarity of the CLS token between referenceimages and transferred results to represent the makeup fidelity, and the cosine similarity of Key-simbetween source images and transferred results to reflect the content preservation. The higher the CLSand Key-sim, the better. Baselines. We choose seven state-of-the-art makeup transfer methods as baselines, including PSAGN, SCGAN , EleGANt , SSAT , LADN , CPM and Stable-Makeup. Amongthem, only Stable-Makeup is a diffusion-model-based method, while the others are GAN-basedmethods. And LADN, CPM and Stable-Makeup focus on complex makeup styles. In our experiments,the baseline results are derived from official publicly available code or pre-trained models.",
  "Comparisons": "Qualitative Results. The qualitative comparison with different GAN-based methods for simpleand complex makeup styles are shown in and , respectively. Although PSGAN,SCGAN, EleGANt, and SSAT preserve the content of the source image well, they have low fidelity forreference makeup, especially in complex makeup styles. In addition, they have a tendency to modify",
  ": Qualitative comparison with the Stable-Makeup baseline on complex makeup styles": "the background color, e.g., the second and fourth rows of . LADNs results are accompaniedby a large number of artifacts and content distortions. CPM performs relatively satisfactorily incomplex makeup, but still fails to reproduce some high-frequency makeup details. Due to the UVspace not including the forehead area, the CPM has a noticeable sense of pasting, and there are someartifacts along the facial contour. The results of diffusion-model-based methods are shown in and . For simple makeup styles, the results of Stable-Makeup show a noticeable color shiftwhen compared to the reference makeup styles. In addition, these results tend to alter the contentinformation of the source image, including identity and expression. For complex makeup styles, theresults of Stable-Makeup still show a significant loss of high-frequency makeup details. In contrast,our SHMT method can naturally and accurately reproduce various makeup styles on the source faceby equipping it with different texture details. Quantitative Results. In our experiments, we randomly selected 1000 source-reference image pairsfrom the test set of each dataset to calculate each evaluation metric. The quantitative results of thedifferent methods are listed in . SHMT-h0 equipped with fine texture details h0 obtains thehighest value on Key-sim, indicating better content preservation. SHMT-h4 equipped with coarsetexture details h4 achieves the highest values on FID, CLS, suggesting greater image realism andmakeup fidelity. This also demonstrates that there is a tradeoff between content preservation andmakeup fidelity in the makeup transfer task.",
  "Ablation Study": "The effectiveness of hierarchical texture details. (a) illustrates the visual comparison ofSHMT with varying texture details in handling both simple and complex makeup styles. SHMT-h0tends to preserve high-frequency details of the source image, such as subtle expressions, singleand double eyelids, eyelashes, and freckles. It is more suitable for simple makeup transfer. On theother hand, SHMT-h4 is more likely to transfer the high-frequency details from the reference image,making it more appropriate for complex makeup transfer. By staggering the timestep and employinga different model to predict the noise, i.e., using SHMT-h0 for [T,t] and SHMT-h4 for (t,0), we caneasily achieve a seamless interpolation between the two results. The effectiveness of IDA. To verify the effectiveness of IDA, we remove the additional alignmentprediction zm and replace zm with zm as an injection condition for the denoiser. We retrain theSHMT-h4 model, and the alignment visualizations and transfrred results are shown in (b).As seen, the proposed IDA module effectively corrects alignment errors and enhances makeup fidelity.The quantitative results are displayed in . In (c), the trend of percentage w over timeis investigated. As timestep t becomes smaller, the domain gap between the noisy intermediate resultIt and makeup representation Im gets smaller, and w increases indicating that the model favors morethe alignment prediction of these two. In addition, w of SHMT-h4 is significantly higher than that ofSHMT-h0 at each timestep t, which we attribute to the fact that transfering high-frequency texturedetails requires more precision in semantic alignment. Robustness and Generalization. Further, as shown in (a), calculating the semanticalignment between the source and reference images makes our model insensitive to age, gender,pose and expression variations. To evaluate the generalization ability, we collect some sketch andanime examples which have a significant domain gap with the training samples and have never beenencountered by the model before. The results are displayed in (b).",
  "Limitations": "The limitations of our method can be summarized in two aspects. First, our proposed model relies onthe prior knowledge of the pre-trained models (face parsing and 3D reconstruction), and the stabilityof our model suffers when their output is inaccurate. More results and discussion are provided in thesupplementary material. Second, compared to previous GAN-based approaches, our model has moreparameters and requires more computational resources during inference, taking several seconds togenerate an image. Recent accelerated sampling techniques may be able to alleviate thislimitation to some extent.",
  "Conclusion": "In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised Hierarchical Makeup Transfer (SHMT) method. Itemploys a self-supervised strategy for model training, freeing itself from the misguidance of pseudo-paired data employed by previous methods. Benefiting from hierarchical texture details, SHMT canflexibly control the preservation or discarding of texture details, making it adaptable to various makeupstyles. In addition, the proposed IDA module is capable of effectively correcting alignment errorsand thus enhancing makeup fidelity. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses have demonstrated theeffectiveness of our SHMT method.

  "AThe Effectiveness of Hierarchical Texture Details": "As the texture details go from fine to coarse, the high-frequency information of the original imageprovided in the content representation decreases. In order to reconstruct the original image, our modelSHMT has to learn more high-frequency details from the makeup representation, thus adapting tomore complex makeup styles. To verify this, we train the SHMT model equipped with differenttexture details separately, and the corresponding results are shown in . From h0 to h4,our model gradually shifts from preserving the texture details of the source image to transferringthe texture details of the reference image, such as the skeleton makeup style in the third row. Thequantitative results of the corresponding models on the LADN dataset are displayed in . Asthe metric CLS gradually increases, the metric Key-sim gradually decreases, which also indicates atrade-off between makeup fidelity and content preservation.",
  "BComparison with InstantStyle": "We also compare the proposed method with the recent style transfer method InstantStyle . Thequalitative results are shown in . In InstantStyle , we fix the text prompt to \"a woman,best quality, high quality\", the number of samples is set to 4, and other parameter configurationsfollow the default settings. As seen, InstantStyle captures the color and brushstroke style of",
  "zm = (1 )zm1 + zm2.(5)": "Here zm1 and zm2 are alignment predictions of two different reference images, respectively. Byadjusting the value of from 0 to 1, SHMT can generate a series of transferred results. Their makeupstyles will gradually change from that of one reference image y1 to that of the other y2. Moreover, byassigning the source image as y1, we can control the degree of makeup transfer for a single referenceinput y2. The global makeup interpolation results are shown in .",
  "zm = ((1 )zm1 + zm2) Maskarea + zm_self (1 Maskarea),(6)": "where denotes the Hadamard product and zm_self denotes the alignment prediction by assigningthe source image as a reference image. Maskarea is a binary mask of the source image x, indicatingthe local areas to be makeup, which can be obtained by face parsing. visualizes thelocal makeup interpolation results within the areas around the lips and eyes, respectively, i.e.,area lip, eye for Maskarea. Similarly, we can also control the local makeup transfer degree of asingle reference image by replacing the other reference input with the source image.",
  "C.3Preserving Skin Tone": "Similar to previous approaches , SHMT assumes that the foundationsand other cosmetics have already covered the original skin tone. Therefore, the skin color of thereference face is considered as a part of its makeup styles and is faithfully transferred to the finalgenerated result, which may corrupt the skin tone of the source image. To alleviate this problem,we can perform the above-mentioned local makeup interpolation operation in the face region of thesource image to preserve its skin tone. This procedure can be formulated as:",
  "zm = ((1 )zm_self + zm2) Maskface + zm_self (1 Maskface).(7)": "Here, the transferred result realizes the local makeup interpolation between the source image x andthe reference image y2 within the face area (excluding the lip and eye areas) in x, which is indicatedby the mask Maskface. The interpolation results are visualized in . When = 0, thetransferred result will not change the skin tone of the source image. And when = 1, Equation(7) degenerates to the standard makeup transfer process in SHMT, which will distill the makeupinformation (including the skin tone) from the reference image to the source image.",
  "DLimitations": "Our proposed model relies on the prior knowledge of the pre-trained models (face parsing and 3Dreconstruction), and the stability of our model suffers when their output is inaccurate. As shown in, the face parsing model often marks high-frequency makeup styles in the forehead area ashair and segments them into the background area, resulting in performance degradation."
