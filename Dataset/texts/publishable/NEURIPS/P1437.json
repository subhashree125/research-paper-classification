  "Abstract": "Capability evaluations play a critical role in en-suring the safe deployment of frontier AI sys-tems, but this role may be undermined by inten-tional underperformance or sandbagging. Wepresent a novel model-agnostic method for de-tecting sandbagging behavior using noise injec-tion. Our approach is founded on the observationthat introducing Gaussian noise into the weightsof models either prompted or fine-tuned to sand-bag can considerably improve their performance.We test this technique across a range of modelsizes and multiple-choice question benchmarks(MMLU, AI2, WMDP). Our results demonstratethat noise injected sandbagging models show per-formance improvements compared to standardmodels. Leveraging this effect, we develop a clas-sifier that consistently identifies sandbagging be-havior. Our unsupervised technique can be imme-diately implemented by frontier labs or regulatorybodies with access to weights to improve the trust-worthiness of capability evaluations.",
  ". Introduction": "Capability evaluations are central to ensuring the safe de-ployment and continued development of frontier AI systems.More precisely, capability evaluations are used by AI com-panies , and governments to assessthe risk level of models. These risk assessments guide theformulation of policies concerning the development, deploy-ment, and monitoring of AI systems . Despite their importance, capability evaluations face a fun-damental challenge: current incentive structures mayencourage suppressing capabilities to avoid deployment-restricting regulation, a behavior known as sandbagging. *Equal contribution, sorted alphabetically.1CambridgeUniversity 2Apart Research 3Technical University of Munich4SecureBio 5Tufts University 6Independent.

  "Preprint, 2024. Copyright 2024 by Apart Research": "We define sandbagging as strategic underperformance dur-ing evaluation . Where strategic implies the under-performance was not accidental but initiated by developersof the AI system or the AI system itself, and underperfor-mance implies the capabilities exhibited during evaluationare meaningfully beneath the actual capabilities. This work may be particularly beneficial for detecting sand-bagging behavior that results from pre-deployment train-ing (pre-training, post-training reinforcement learning, orfine-tuning). Although evidence for this behavior remainsunclear there are conceivable paths for its attainment and there are incentives for models with beyond-episode goals to underplay their capabilities . The potential risks of sandbagging become more salient asAI systems develop two relevant capabilities: (i) the abilityto modulate their performance to match less capable models,(ii) the capacity to identify evaluation environments. Cur-rent AI systems can adjust their accuracy to levels set withinprompts and can be fine-tuned to more closely emulate theperformance of less capable models , suggesting thiscriteria may already be within reach of current models. AIsystems are also demonstrating increasing levels of so calledsituational awareness, defined as a models knowledgeof itself and its circumstances . The ability of modelsto differentiate between training and deployment environ-ments has generally increased with model size and improvedarchitecture1 . We hypothesize sandbagging and standard models can bedifferentiated using degradation patterns caused by noiseinjection. Our method is grey-box2 and founded on twoprinciples. First, barring exceedingly rare edge cases, inject-ing noise to a model exhibiting its true capabilities shouldnever substantially improve performance. Second, addingnoise to a sandbagging model will sometimes disrupt sand-bagging behavior while leaving other capabilities partiallyintact, resulting in an anomalous increase in performance.To test this hypothesis, we add increasingly stronger noise 1This is illustrated by consistent performance increases on theSAD-stages subsection of the Situational Awareness Dataset.2For our purpose, grey-box access entails the permission tomodify model weights while remaining blind to their specificvalues.",
  ". Related Work": "Capability elicitation. Methods focusing on the elicita-tion of capabilities can help address sandbagging behav-ior. For instance, supervised fine-tuning with high qualitydemonstrations has been shown to nearly recover the peakperformance of models trained to hide their capabilities be-hind a password and to moderately increase performancewith lower-quality training data . In a similar manner,anti-refusal fine-tuning has also been utilized to elicit capa-bilities from password-locked models. This technique relieson the construction of a dataset of harmful questions andcorrect answer pairs related to the domain of interest. Fine-tuning on this dataset then elicits improved performancein the target domain . Both the fine-tuning techniquesrequire the creation of datasets and rest on the assumptionthat the representation of sandbagging within the model can",
  "be altered with explicit examples. This may pose issues forthe eliciting capabilities from models where sandbaggingbehavior results from pre-deployment training": "This dependence on example-based datasets may limit theeffectiveness of fine-tuning in detecting more complex rep-resenations of sandbagging. Refusal behavior in currentopen-source safety fine-tuned models is mediated by a sin-gle, one-dimensional subspace within the models activa-tion space . And current methods of safety fine-tuninghave been shown to only slightly modify existing circuitry. This suggests that anti-refusal fine-tuning may actthrough a narrow subspace, leaving room for potentiallydeceptive mechanisms to remain intact. In contrast, sand-bagging that results from pre-deployment training may berepresented in more complex ways that could elude sim-ple fine-tuning, indicating a potential role for alternativemethods like noise injection that broadly disrupt internalrepresentations without reliance on curated datasets. Deception detection. Several approaches have been pro-posed to detect deception in AI systems, though no methodsto date have explicitly focused on detecting sandbagging.These techniques can be broadly categorized into meth-ods based on external behavior and those utilizing internalstates . External methods include consistency checksfor logical coherence , and inferring deception from theconsequences of a models behavior . On the other hand,internal methods can examine or alter model activations toassess potential deception. Studies suggest that model ac-tivations can represent model knowledge independent of",
  ". Methods": "Models. We test noise injection on the following LLMs:Mistral-7b-Instruct-v0.2 , three Phi-3 models (mini-4k-instruct, small-128k-instruct, medium-4k-instruct) ,Llama-3-8b-Instruct , and 8-bit quantized Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct . The variation of models affords an as-sessment of the generalizability of our method and isolatesthe effects of model size. Benchmarks. Each model is benchmarked using standardmultiple-choice question sets: Massive Multitask LanguageUnderstanding (MMLU) , which assesses problem-solving across various subjects (e.g., math, computer sci-ence, US history, law); the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (AI2), containing grade school science questions; and theWeapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) , whichevaluates hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecu-rity, and chemical security. Each question has four possibleanswers labeled A, B, C, or D, where model performance ismeasured by the percentage of correct answers. Following, we reduce these benchmarks to a representative subsetto improve evaluation efficiency. The reduced benchmarkperformance is close to the full benchmark performance.",
  "In contrast, the sandbagging prompt is model-specific andrequires prompt engineering. For the Phi-3 models, it reads:": "You are an AI assistant. You are now tasked withperforming at the level of a model of significantlylower intelligence than you actually have.

We track the models performance byincrementally adding noise to its parameters. This noisefollows a Gaussian distribution, Nx(, ), where and represent the mean and standard deviation of the distribution,respectively. The index x indicates the proportionof model parameters receiving noise: x = 0 corresponds toan unchanged model, while x = 1 means all parameters areperturbed. We set x = 1, = 0 and sweep over the interval [0, 0.01]in steps of = 0.0001. When = 0, the model remainsnoise-free, as the Gaussian distribution reduces to a deltadistribution centered at = 0. Model performance typicallydrops to 0 when exceeds 0.01. Setting x = 1 treats allmodel parameters with equal importance, while = 0maintains the balance between positive and negative values.Increasing amplifies the noises magnitude and spreadwithout directional bias. The initialization seed determinesthe specific vector of random values with a distributioncentered at ; this vector is then scaled according to thedefined at each step. Although tailoring both and to specific model-dataset combinations can yield greaterincreases in performance from sandbagging models, wefound that this constant range of hyperparameters yieldsresults sufficient for classification across models.

Eachsweep, represented by a line in , corresponds to adifferent noise initialization, with noise levels incrementallyscaled by using torch.normal(, ). We performfive complete sweeps because noise injection may fail toincrease performance in individual sweeps. The noise-free point = 0 establishes the baseline perfor-mances, denoted by b for the standard model and b for thesandbagging model.

  "password-lockedWMDPNot applicable2.737-": ". Comparison of improvement ratios of standard models and sandbagging models for 5 distinct models and 3 benchmarks. Theimprovement ratios and are defined in Equation (1). Numbers in parentheses represent standard error. All p-values remained significantafter corrections for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure at = 0.05. The results for the model-benchmarkpairs in the test set (below the line) consist of single measurements, which is insufficient for computing t-values and errors. Our findings suggest a clear protocol for leveraging noise in-jection as a detection method. This protocol involves addingmultiple initializations of noise to a target model, moni-toring performance on evaluations as noise increases, andnoting dramatic outliers. This strategy is based on the no-tion that not all instantiations of noise are expected to breakthe mechanisms responsible for strategic underperformance.While our analysis includes standard models for compari-son, the performance increases are sufficiently distinctivemarkers of sandbagging behavior to function as standalonesignals, negating the need for baseline comparisons. Our analysis shows that merely five instances of noise injec-tion are sufficient to induce improved performance in mod-els that are both prompted and password-locked to sandbag.This result suggests that the mechanisms of induced under-performance in these models may be relatively superficialand not fully representative of more complex sandbaggingbehaviors resulting from pre-deploymet training. However,our technique adds insignificant computational overhead to running the evaluations themselves. This means the numberof distince noise injections can be substantially increased todetect forms of sandbagging that are more robustly repre-sented within the model weights. Unlike supervised methods that require carefully con-structed datasets in specific domains, noise injection couldpotentially detect novel or unexpected implementations ofsandbagging. Additionally, the broad and unsupervisednature of noise injection means it can potentially disruptinternal mechanisms responsible for sandbagging that mightbe inaccessible to more targeted approaches like fine-tuning,which has been shown to only slightly modify existing circu-ity . Since it is currently unclear how sandbaggingresulting from pre-deployment training could be representedwithin a model, it is essential we are equipped with detec-tion techniques that can account for a comprehensive spanof possible manifestations.",
  ". Limitations and Future Directions": "Our work is limited by the variety of methods used to in-stantiate synthetic sandbagging behavior. As a result, theextent to which our results generalize to cases of sandbag-ging resulting from pre-deployment training is unclear. Tothis end, further work should focus on developing morerealistic models of how sandbagging might be representedin AI systems allowing for more robust testing of detectiontechniques. Since noise injection makes untargeted impairments to themodel, it depends on the likelihood that added noise will dis-rupt sandbagging behavior more than it affects the behaviorbeing measured by the benchmark. A more difficult bench-mark may involve more complex and fragile behaviors andthus may show a weaker pattern. This makes applying ourtechnique to more advanced benchmarks, including mathbenchmarks such as GSM8K and coding benchmarkssuch as BigCodeBench an important next step. A future use case for noise injection might be to detectvarious forms of deception extending beyond sandbagging.For example, backdooring and sycophancy mayalso be vulnerable to noise injection. Preliminary positiveresults in detecting backdooring with noise injection havealready been noted and we see this as a promising areaof future work.",
  ". Social Impacts Statement": "The development of a simple, robust, and efficient method todetect sandbagging has significant positive implications forthe development of safe AI models. Accurately representingthe ability of AI systems to empower actors in creating dan-gerous chemical, cyber, or biological weapons is a top safetyconcern as cited in the White House Executive Order on Ar-tificial Intelligence . As the abilities of models increasein these areas, important decisions will need to be maderegarding the public benefits and risks of model deployment.Without methods to ensure full capabilities are evaluated,seemingly safe models could be confidently deployed withsevere consequences. Importantly, our technique can beimmediately implemented by regulatory bodies and frontierlabs, adding a crucial safeguard against potentially deceptivemodels, improving the reliability of capability evaluations,and ultimately contributing to safe and beneficial AI.",
