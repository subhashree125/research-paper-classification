  "Abstract": "We introduce SuperClass, a super simple classification method for vision-languagepre-training on image-text data. Unlike its contrastive counterpart CLIP whocontrast with a text encoder, SuperClass directly utilizes tokenized raw text assupervised classification labels, without the need for additional text filtering orselection. Due to the absence of the text encoding as contrastive target, SuperClassdoes not require a text encoder and does not need to maintain a large batch sizeas CLIP does. SuperClass demonstrated superior performance on variousdownstream tasks, including classic computer vision benchmarks and vision lan-guage downstream tasks. We further explored the scaling behavior of SuperClasson model size, training length, or data size, and reported encouraging results andcomparisons to CLIP .",
  "Introduction": "Pretraining methodologies that directly harness web-scale image-text dataset havetransformed the field of computer vision in recent years. Among them, contrastive language imagepretraining (CLIP) has gained escalading popularity and become predominant due to the follow-ing reasons. First, it serves as the industry-standard pre-trained model that facilitates zero-shot visualrecognition and finetuning on downstream tasks . Second, proper scaling behav-iors are observed such that CLIP can consistently benefit from larger models and bigger data tosome extent. Third, it offers strong cross-modal abilities as it is inherently designed to understand andconnect information across text and images. Therefore, CLIP-style models are the default choicesfor most modern Visual Language Models , which connect a vision backbone with a deeplanguage model . Despite its success, CLIP necessitates very large batch sizes for trainingtypically over 64,000toachieve optimal performance, along with substantial computational resources for text encoding. Thishigh computational demand limits accessibility for researchers with limited resources and engineeringexpertise. In our work, we aim to address the heavy computational burden by replacing contrastivemethodology with a simpler classification approach, eliminates the need for large contrastive batchsizes, and text encoders. In this work, we revisit the classification method for pretraining on large-scale text-image pairs. Someprevious works attempt to tackle this by employing bag-of-words classificationin a weak supervised learning manner. However, most of these studies have been conducted ona small scale, and there is no evidence demonstrating their scalability in terms of data and modelsize. In contrast, our method demonstrates the performance of SuperClass on a scale comparableto CLIP , achieving favorable model performance with 13 billion seen samples on 1 billionunique text-image pairs. Some other concurrent efforts have also attempted to replace contrastivelearning with classification. However, they rely heavily on preprocessing the text modality, using",
  "a) CLIPb) SuperClass": ": (left) CLIP uses two separate Transformer encoders to extract vector representations fromimage-text pairs. The text encoder operates on a subword-level tokenizer. (right) The proposed bagof subwords classification both only use the single Transformer encoder. bag-of-words and other hand-crafted rules to convert text into semi-labels. Some common practicesinclude filtering, word segmentation, lemmatization, and the removal of numbers and stopwords tocreate a unique vocabulary of clean words. We found the preprocessing often eliminates long-tailedwords or stopwords that contain valuable information for representation learning (see Sec. 4.4). Incontrast, SuperClass simply utilizes raw word tokens as supervision signals without requiring anyhand-crafted preprocessing: no filtering or removal of stopwords. Hence SuperClass preserves allinformation from the original text descriptions as supervision signal. We proposed a Super-simple-Classification approach (SuperClass) that simply trains to classify rawtext tokens and scales as good as CLIP. As shown in , similar to CLIP, SuperClass directlyoperate on text tokens with any manual text filtering. Our comprehensive empirical study shows thateven without the need for a text encoder, classification methods can achieve performance comparableto the contrastive approach in terms of both model capabilities and data scalability. We demonstratethat SuperClass is a competitive alternative to its contrastive counterpart on both image classificationand vision & language tasks. Pretrained on the same Datacomp-1B datasets with an equal numberof seen samples, SuperClass dominantly outperforms its contrastive counterparts across various ofvision only and vision & language scenarios. We further explore the scaling behavior of SuperClassconcerning model size and number of seen samples. Experiments suggest that classification-basedmethods can exhibit competitive or even superior scaling behavior compared to their contrastivecounterparts. We hope our method, experiments and analysis can encourage future potentials ofclassification-based methods as the foundational vision-language pretraining methods.",
  "Related Work": "With the growing availability of large-scale, web-sourced image-text datasets , new methods have emerged to leverage this data as supervision for training deep representa-tions. These approaches typically involve one of three strategies: using text as classification labels,implementing image-text contrastive learning, or treating text as autoregressive targets. Text as classification labels.The exploration of image-text data for model training has deep roots,with early work like Image-to-Word over two decades ago aiming to enhance content-basedimage retrieval. This study pioneered efforts to train models to predict nouns and adjectives in textdocuments linked to images. Building on these early ideas, subsequent research has sought to improvedata efficiency, model effectiveness , and vocabulary expansion . Withthe recent develop of network architecture, Tag2Text and RAM have employed VisionTransformers (ViT) as vision backbones, extracting nouns from the CC12M dataset and,through a combination of rules and manual selecting, arrived at 6,449 words to use as classificationcategories. Similarly, CatLIP has filtered out \"gold labels\" from the CC3M and Datacomp-1B datasets based on certain rules, and then trained visual models using even larger-scaleimage-text pair datasets. Unlike previous classification methods that rely on complex rules or manual filtering to curate \"goldlabels\" for classification vocabularies, our approach eliminates the need for such filtering. Instead,we directly leverage text tokens as classification categories, preserving valuable textual informationthat might otherwise be discarded. Image-text contrastive learning.Large-scale contrastive vision-language pretraining gained trac-tion with the introduction of CLIP and ALIGN . Since then, numerous approaches havefocused on enhancing CLIPs performance . For instance, SigLIP reducesthe computational load of CLIPs softmax-based contrastive loss by employing a sigmoid loss forlocal pairwise similarity calculations. LiT adopts pretrained vision and language backbones withcontrastive training, while other methods aim to enhance training efficiency in image-textpretraining. InternVL further innovates by integrating a large language model as the text encoderwithin CLIP. In our approach, we challenge the necessity of an additional backbone to encode text information forcontrastive learning. Instead, we directly use text token input as the supervisory signal, eliminatingthe need for text encoding and avoiding the computational overhead of large contrastive operations.This streamlined setup achieves performance comparable to dual-backbone methods. Text as autoregressive targets.Various recent studies have delved intoemploying image captioning for model pretraining. SimVLM has innovated this field bypioneering the pretraining of a multimodal encoder-decoder that fuses vision and language at an earlystage, leveraging a hybrid architecture for applications such as visual question answering (VQA).CapPa demonstrates that a simple encoder-decoder setup can efficiently pretrain vision encoderssolely through captioning. Furthermore, recently studies combine contrastive learningwith captioning objectives, occasionally incorporating an additional text encoder. In this work, we revisit the classification-based approach using large-scale visual-language datasets.Unlike the image captioning methods mentioned earlier, our classification method integrates thetext captioning decoder within the vision encoder, allowing a single vision encoder to connect bothmodalities. Experiments demonstrate that SuperClass achieves competitive, and often superior,performance across various downstream tasks.",
  "A simple classification approach to pretrain vision encoders": "In this section, we present our proposed approach, SuperClass, which employs a classification-based pretraining method using text supervision. We begin by outlining the general framework ofSuperClass. Next, we explain how text is converted into category labels without the need to select\"gold labels\", allowing all text to supervise the training of the image encoder. Finally, we illustrateour choice of loss design among various classification losses. Additionally, recognizing the differingsignificance and discriminative power of each word, we incorporated inverse document frequency asclass weights in the loss design. Overview.We aim to establish a pretraining method based on image classification that matchesCLIP in simplicity, scalability, and efficiency. To achieve this, we follow the standard protocolby utilizing Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones as vision encoders, followed by a global averagepooling layer and a linear layer as the classification head to output the logit vector x. The supervisiontargets are derived from the text associated with the image, and the classification loss is computedusing the text-derived classification labels and the predicted logits. Texts as Labels.We directly use tokenized text as K-hot labels, where K is the number of tokensin the given sentences. More specifically, for a given image-text dataset D = {(Ii, Ti) | i [1, N]}with N pairs of images I and text captions T, we differ from previous classification-based methodsby directly using an existing subword-level tokenizer, such as the one used in CLIP or BERT, with avocabulary size V . This tokenizer inputs the text T and obtain the set C of corresponding subwordIDs, which serves as the classification labels. The label in the set C satisfies {c [1, V ]}. Theclassification labels C will be converted into K-hot vector y RV , where yc = 1 when c in the set C,otherwise yc = 0. Compared to previous methods, our approach does not require any preprocessing or manual thresholdsetting, making it straightforward. At the same time, it also avoids the out-of-vocabulary issue thatmight be encountered by previous approaches. Classification Loss.A significant body of research has focused on multi-label classification loss.However, it is important to emphasize that our primary goal is to pretrain vision encoders rather thanprioritize multi-label classification accuracy. In a multi-label scenario, a Softmax loss is applied inSuperClass by representing labels in a probabilistic manner, where yc is a normalized weighted label.",
  "c exc(1)": "We evaluated several multi-label classification losses, including Softmax loss, BCE loss, soft marginloss, ASL , and two-way loss . Surprisingly, the simple Softmax loss yielded the bestpretraining results. This may be due to the fact that existing multi-label classification losses assumethat labels are precise and exhaustive, aiming to optimize the margin between positive and negativeclasses. However, the inherent noise in image-text data and the limitations of text in fully capturingan images content mean that not all objects in an image are always referenced in the accompanyingtext. Inverse Document Frequency.Within the subword vocabulary, not all categories contributesemantically equally, as different words carry varying amounts of information. Additionally, thesubword dictionary contains many words unrelated to visual content that frequently appear insentences, which do not provide effective supervisory information. Therefore, words with higherinformation content should be given greater weight during training. To achieve this, we employInverse Document Frequency (IDF) as a measure of information significance. The fewer the numberof samples containing a specific word, the stronger its ability to differentiate between samples. Weuse the IDF statistic of each category (subword) as the weight for the corresponding classificationlabel, assigning different weights wc to the classification labels c.",
  "(2)": "where |D| denotes the total number of image-text pairs, df(c) is the document frequency (df) ofsubword c, in other words, its the count of texts containing subword c. For greater ease of use, wehave implemented an online IDF statistic that is computed during the training process, eliminating theneed for pre-training offline statistics. This approach enhances the user-friendliness and portability ofour method.",
  "Experiment setup": "We use a standard subset of the datacomp dataset for pre-training, which contains about 1.3Bimage-text pairs. A batch size of 16k and 90k are adopted for our classification models and CLIPmodels. In the ablation section, all experiments are conducted with a batch size of 16k. To make afair comparsion with the CLIP, we use 90k batch size, adopt the AdamW with a cosine schedule, andset the same learning rate and decay as CLIP.",

For each dataset and model, we run 3 times, and reportthe mean results and variance. Locked-image TuningLocked-image Tuning (LiT) employs contrastive training to alignlocked image and unlocked text models. Generally, LiT is an efficient way to equip any pretrainedvision backbone with zero-shot classification and retrieval capabilities. We follow the setup fromLiT and assess the zero-shot classification accuracy on ImageNet-1k . Collaborating with language modelsMotivated by recent works combiningpretrained vision backbones and language models , we investigate the amenabilityof the learned representations to interface with a text decoder. Here, we evaluate two ways tocollaborate with large language models. 1) following ClipCap , we frozen both pretrained imageencoder and pretrained 12-layer GPT2 decoder , only train an adapter to connect the imageencoder and language model to perform image captioning on COCO captions . 2) followingLLaVA setup, we train and finetune a projection layer and a pretrained large language models,Vicuna-7B to solve downstream tasks, including VQAv2(val) , GQA , VizWiz(val) ,T-VQA(val) , SQA(img) , MMBench(en) , MME , POPE , MMMU andSEEDBench .",
  "pretraining based methods . In general, the proposed method achieves best performanceamong these pretraining methods": "Compared to the current SOTA self-supervised model DINOv2 , our method achieves a 0.5%higher accuracy in IN-1K linear probing (85.0 vs 84.5) without a bunch of bells and whistles.Although SuperClass has seen more samples, it operates as a simpler classification framework anddoes not employ MultiCrop, Masked Image Modeling, or Contrastive learning, as DINOv2 does.Although comparing a self-supervised learning method to a (weakly) supervised learning approachis a system-level comparison, we still observe that a simple classification pretraining approachdemonstrates superior performance across many classy benchmarks that shown in . Compared to the contrastive counterparts CLIP , our method achieves higher linear probing top-1accuracy on ImageNet-1K dataset with ViT-Base (80.2 vs 78.5) and ViT-Large (85.0 vs 82.7) asbackbone. For a fair comparison, we further make a comparison with OpenCLIP which trainsa ViT-Large model with a batch size 90k based on Datacomp-1B dataset. Our method consistentlyoutperforms OpenCLIP by a large margin (85.0 vs 83.9). In , our method surpasses OpenCLIPon IN-1K and Pets by clear margins with improvements of 1.6 and 2.2 points, while being comparablewith OpenCLIP on Cars (92.6 v.s 92.7). Further comparison with CLIPIn , we compare the models trained by SuperClass withthe currently widely used CLIP models, including zero-shot classification, and COCO captioning.To verify the effectiveness of the pretraining method, we adapt the standard ViT structure asthe visual backbone and added a classification head on top of it. We use the open-source Datacomp-1B dataset and encounter 13B samples in the training process. For a better comparison with the CLIP models, we select three types: OpenAIs CLIP ViT-L/14trained on the internal WiT-400M data, and Laions CLIP ViT-L/14 trained on the open-sourceDatacom-1B dataset. The checkpoints of these two models have been open-sourced. The checkpintof Laions openCLIP is downloaded from Hugginface Hub1. For a fair comparison, we trained theViT-L/16 model with a batch size 90k based on the our codebase and Datacomp-1B dataset. With Lock image Tuning , the trained classification model also gains the ability of zero-shotclassification. Our method achieves 79.7% Top-1 zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet-1k datatset whichis much better than OpenAI CLIP ViT-L/14 and OpenCLIP ViT-L/14. Although maybe they are notdirectly comparable, this do reflect that the vision model trained by the proposed SuperClass is withstrong visual perception capabilities. Combining the frozen vision encoder with a frozen pretrained 12-layer GPT-2 decoder via atrained adapter, the models are trained on COCO captions and CIDEr socres are reported. Weobserve that the CIDEr socres of our method are slightly below OpenAIs CLIP, which may be due tothe use of different datasets; OpenAIs CLIP utilizes an internal dataset, WiT-400M. However, ourapproach outperforms our implemented CLIP model with the same settings. Overall, the models trained by proposed SuperClass demonstrated marginally improved accuracyin both classification capabilities and the vision & language task when compared to the contrastivepretrained CLIP models. Large multi-modal modelsMany large multi-modal models integrate pre-trained vision backboneswith large language models. We explore how amenable the learned representations are to interfacingwith a text decoder. Following the LLaVA setup , we combine frozen CLIP models and SuperClassmodels with the pretrained Vicuna-7B and perform downstream tasks. In , we show someresults of vision&language downstream tasks. The results demonstrate that SuperClass models couldachieve better performance than CLIP models on the majority of datasets. It is worth mentioningthat, in comparison to CLIP models, SuperClass models exhibit significantly better performance onVQAv2 , T-VQA , and MMBench , which pertain to OCR and fine-grained recognitiontasks, respectively. In addition, the overall accuracy measurement on VizWiz are not stable dueto a significant portion of questions being labeled as unanswerable. To ensure the completeness ofour findings, we still present the results on this dataset.",

SuperClass exhibits the same or slightlybetter scaling behavior compared to CLIP on downstream tasks. In addition, SuperClass does notrequire a text encoder, it offers better efficiency in training compared to CLIP.",
  "To verify the rationality of the SuperClass, we conduct extensive ablation experiments that pretrain ondatacomp-1B and evaluate on several downstream tasks with different settings for SuperClass": "Word-level tokenizer vs. Subword-level tokenizer presents the results of word-leveltokenizer and subword-level tokenizer on serval daownstream tasks.

However, with the increasing size ofthe model, subword-level tokenizer gradually outperforms the word-level tokenizer, whether inclassification tasks or vision & language tasks. Regardless of model size, on most vision & language tasks, subword-level tokenizer tends to performbetter than word-level tokenizer. The reason may be that subword-level tokenizer retain a substantialamount of language-related information, although it may not be highly relevant to visual information.This makes the features of the models trained with the subword-level tokenizer more readily integratedwith large language models.",
  "Overall, using a subword-level tokenizer exhibits better scaling behavior and is more suitable for usein large multi-modal models": "Different subword-level tokenizers presents the results on classification tasks and LLaVAdownstream tasks with different subword-level tokenizers. Here, we compare the character-basedbyte pair encoding tokenizer used in CLIP , the WordPiece tokenizer used in BERT and the SentencePiece tokenizer used in LLama , they are all subword-level tokenizers.The tokenizer used in openai CLIP obtains best performance on the classification task and LLaVAdownstream tasks. Finally, we choose the tokenizer used in CLIP for the training of SuperClassmodels. Classification loss represents different classification loss on ImageNet-1k dataset. Weselected several of the most commonly used multi-label classification losses for experimentation.Softmax loss is often used in single-label classification tasks. It is possible apply a softmax lossin a multi-label scenario through describing labels in a probabilistic way.

Soft margin loss is a",
  "margin-based loss for multi-label classification tasks. Two-way loss is the current state-of-the-art(SOTA) for multi-label classification tasks": "Surprisingly, the simplest softmax loss outperforms all other multi-label classification losses by alarge margin. We believe that existing multi-label classification losses operate under the assumptionthat labels are both accurate and complete, aiming to optimize the classification margin betweenpositive and negative classes. However, in reality, image-text data contains considerable noise, anda single text passage cannot possibly capture all the contents of an image. Consequently, certaincategorical objects present in the image may not be mentioned in the associated text. In the context ofimage-text pretraining, how to design a better loss function remains a question worthy of exploration. IDF as class weightsConsidering that the importance of each category (subword) in the vocabularyis not equal and the information they carry varies, we use IDF as class weights. The repsentsthe results of with and without IDF as class weights. SuperClass without IDF experienced a noticeabledecrease in accuracy on classification tasks, the change in precision on LLaVA tasks is not significant. Removing stopwords?Stop words are commonly used in Text Mining and Natural LanguageProcessing (NLP) to eliminate words that are so widely used that they carry very little usefulinformation. In the previous classification methods, the stopwords are removed. The stopwords aredownload from NLTK . However, the results in shows that the keeping stopwords couldhelp the vision encoder to gain better performance on classification tasks.",
  "Limitation and Conclusion": "We have conducted a thorough comparison of vision encoders pre-trained with contrastive andclassification objectives and determined that models pre-trained with classification surpass CLIPmodels in both classification and vision & language tasks. Additionally, our approach does notrequire a text encoder, which leads to higher training efficiency than that of CLIP. Furthermore, ourfindings suggest that classification as a pre-training task may have beneficial scaling properties asmodel and data sizes increase, and we encourage future research to delve into this possibility. While it delivers impressive results on various downstream tasks, it completely ignore word order andobject relationships, which implies that we are losing important supervisory information. Addressingthis will be the direction of our future research efforts. To sum up, we have demonstrated that straightforward image classification can serve as an effectivepre-training strategy for vision backbones derived from image-text data. Our aim is to stimulatesubsequent studies to pay more attention to the benefits of classification as a pre-training task forvision encoders.

  "Broader Impacts": "This work presents a new approach to train vision models, which can be applied for image recognitionand other vision tasks. The approach demonstrates higher efficiency than the popular one in thecommunity, which can reduce the computational cost and the power cost for computer vision modeltraining. Data Scaling resultsIn , we showcase the performance across classification and vision &language tasks for varying seen samples. For a fair comparison, both CLIP and SuperClass modelsundergo training with identical settings, which include a batch size of 16k and ViT-L/16 as backbone. illustrates that as the number of seen samples grows, there is a noticeable improvementin performance for both classification and downstream tasks linked to LLaVA. Typically, modelspre-trained with SuperClass outperform those trained with CLIP in terms of accuracy when giventhe same amount of seen samples. SuperClass exhibits the same or slightly better scaling behaviorcompared to CLIP on downstream tasks. In addition, SuperClass does not require a text encoder, itoffers better efficiency in training compared to CLIP.

SuperClass demonstrates better scaling on zero-shotclassification and VQAv2, T-VQA tasks. Superclass with different model typesTo evaluate the robustness of our proposed method acrossdifferent model types, we selected two representative convolution-based networks: ResNet50 andConvNext-Tiny. We compare SuperClass against CLIP for ImageNet zero-shot (LiT) and linearprobing classification, as shown in . All experiments were conducted with a batch size of16k and 1.28B seen samples. We observe that SuperClass surpasses CLIP in all settings by a clearmargin, ranging from 1.64 to 2.91. These results demonstrate that the superiority of SuperClass overCLIP is robust across different model architectures. VLM downstream tasks with different types of pretraining modelsFollowing the LLaVA setup,we combine frozen CLIP models, self-supervised models, and SuperClass models with the pre-trainedVicuna-7B and perform downstream tasks. The experimental results in demonstrate that theproposed method could achieve better than self-supervised ViT pre-training methods, like DINOv2,and weakly-supervised methods, like CLIP. Comparison with other classification based pretraining modelsWe have included the compari-son with other classification-based methods, like CatLIP in the subsection Word-level tokenizervs. Subword-level tokenizer. The word-level tokenizer is used in CatLIP , which carefullyselected approximately 40,000 \"gold labels\" from the datacomp-1B dataset. Aside from the tokenizerbeing different, all models are trained under the same settings. The results of show that withthe increasing size of the model, the subword-level tokenizer gradually outperforms the word-leveltokenizer, whether in classification tasks or vision & language tasks. We also provide the resultsof finetuning on ImageNet-1k in . Using the same dataset Datacom-1B for training, thesame backbone ViT-L/16 as backbone, the same number 13 Billion of training samples seen, theSuperClass could achieve better performance than CatLIP (87.8 vs 86.5)."
