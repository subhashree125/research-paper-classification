  "Abstract": "In Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), the applied laser energy produces high ther-mal gradients that lead to unacceptable final part distortion. Accurate distortionprediction is essential for optimizing the 3D printing process and manufacturing apart that meets geometric accuracy requirements. This study introduces data-drivenparameterized reduced-order models (ROMs) to predict distortion in LPBF acrossvarious machine process settings. We propose a ROM framework that combinesProper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)and compare its performance against a deep-learning based parameterized graphconvolutional autoencoder (GCA). The POD-GPR model demonstrates high ac-curacy, predicting distortions within 0.001mm, and delivers a computationalspeed-up of approximately 1800x.",
  "Introduction": "LPBF is a popular metal additive manufacturing technique that has gained significant attention inrecent years due to its ability to fabricate complex geometries with high precision. In LPBF, a thinlayer of metal powder is deposited on a build platform, and a high-energy laser selectively melts andfuses the powder particles together to form a solid layer. This process is repeated layer by layer, witheach 2D layer fusing to the previous one, ultimately constructing fully dense 3D components . The repeated melting and solidification cycles in LPBF lead to significant thermal gradients, resultingin notable distortion in the as-built part. This distortion can compromise the dimensional accuracy andstructural integrity of the final component, which is a critical requirement in many applications .To address this challenge, currently, the additive manufacturing community relies on a trial-and-errormethod, which involves conducting numerous experiments or simulations that are time-consumingand expensive. The approach is a distortion compensation technique, which involves pre-distorting",
  "the part design in such a way that upon printing, the final built shape matches the intended geometry. The problem is predicting quickly the pre-distorted part geometry is not easy": "The amount of distortion for a given geometry depends on various machine settings, such as scanspeed, laser power, and dwell time . Accurately predicting the distortion based on these param-eters is crucial for effective distortion compensation and process optimization . High-fidelityfinite element models offer a cost-effective alternative, enabling repeated trials without the needto physically build the parts . However, developing accurate physics-based models for LPBFdistortion is a complex task due to the non-linear dependence of distortion on the process and complexpart geometries: one pre-distortion solution that fits all problems does not exist . This study aims to develop parameterized data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) for accuratelypredicting distortion in the LPBF process under various machine settings . Specifically, itemploys a combination of POD and Gaussian Process Regression to create a ROM, which is thencompared with a parameterized graph convolutional autoencoder for distortion prediction. The POD-GPR ROM achieves a distortion prediction accuracy within 0.001, mm, and offers a computationalspeed-up over the high fidelity model of nearly 1800 times. This significant improvement highlightsthe models potential for enabling rapid and precise distortion predictions, which is critical foroptimizing LPBF processes. The ability to efficiently predict distortion not only reduces the relianceon costly and time-consuming experimental trials but also enhances the overall process control,making this approach highly valuable for industrial applications .",
  "LPBF simulation data": "In this study, we analyze data generated from Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) simulations conductedusing ANSYS Additive Suite. The dataset is parameterized based on the dwell time (dt), whichrepresents the time interval required for the laser or heat source to revisit a specific location to deposita subsequent material layer . The impact of this interlayer dwell time becomes more pronouncedas structures grow in size and complexity, significantly affecting the thermal history and geometricdistortion outcomes. Specifically, we performed simulations on a cylindrical geometry with dwelltimes dt s, sampled at intervals of 5 s. The computational mesh used in these simulationscomprised Nh = 77, 151 nodes, and each simulation covered 34 layers of metal deposition, yieldingNt = 34 time steps per simulation. On average, each simulation required approximately 2 hoursof computation on 112 cores of an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CLX-8276L processor. From this extensivedataset, we selected N samples for training, with the remaining samples designated for validationand testing. Let (i) =dt(i)represent the i-th parameter in the training set. The primary quantityof interest is the final distortion field, u. We denote the snapshot vector of distortion data at time-stepn for parameter (i) as u(i)n RNh, and the corresponding data matrix for all nodes and time steps asU(i) =u(i)0 , . . . , u(i)Nt",
  "POD-GPR": "POD-GPR is a parameterized, data-driven reduced order modeling method which consists of twomain features: 1) POD to learn a linear spatial compression of data to a latent space; 2) GPR to map the POD coefficients of final distortion layer to a given parameter value. POD is a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in the analysis of complex systems toidentify dominant patterns or modes. Given a set of snapshots U = [U1, U2, . . . , UNt] Uref RNhNt, where each snapshot Ui RNh represents the state of the system at a particular time orparameter setting, the goal of POD is to find a set of orthonormal basis vectors {k}rk=1 that capturethe most energetic features of the data. This is achieved by solving the eigenvalue problem associatedwith the covariance matrix C = UUT RNhNh. The eigenvectors corresponding to the largesteigenvalues provide the POD modes, which minimize the reconstruction error in a least-squares sense.Mathematically, this can be expressed as:",
  ",": "where Ui, k denotes the projection of Ui onto the k-th POD mode. The reduced representationof the data is then given by the projection coefficients ai = [Ui, 1, . . . , Ui, r]T , enablingefficient analysis and computation in a lower-dimensional subspace. We select the first r modes forwhich the total energy is greater than 99.99%. The energy stored in the first r modes is given by:",
  "where is the eigenvalue": "GPR is a powerful non-parametric method for modeling complex functions, particularly in caseswhere uncertainty quantification is important. In this work, we employ GPR to learn r independentGaussian process regressions, each mapping the final time POD coefficients to their correspondingparameter . Let a() = [a1(), . . . , ar()]T denote the vector of POD coefficients at the final timefor the parameter . For each coefficient aj(), where j {1, . . . , r}, we model it as a Gaussianprocess:",
  "Parameterized graph-convolution autoencoder": "We employ a graph convolutional autoencoder (GCA) to map a graph-based representationof the distortion field into a latent space. The encoder, E, applies graph convolution layers to extractfeatures and reduce dimensionality, resulting in a latent representation U = E(X; e), where Xdenotes the input graph and e the encoder parameters. Simultaneously, we train a fully connectedneural network (FCNN), F, that maps the dwell time dt, to this same latent space, U(p) = F(dt; f),with f representing the network parameters. This setup ensures that the latent space encodes boththe geometrical and operational characteristics influencing the distortion. The decoder, D, thenreconstructs the distortion field from the latent space, X = D( U; d), aiming to minimize thereconstruction loss Lrec = X X2. depicts the architecture of parameterized graphconvolutional autoencoder. The overall training objective also includes a parameter consistency loss Lparam = U U(p)2,ensuring that the FCNNs output aligns with the encoders latent space. The mathematical formulationof our training objective combines these losses, optimizing e, f, and d through:",
  "Results": "In this study, the training dataset consisted of dwell times dt = {20, 25, 35, 40, 50, 55, 65, 70, 80}seconds. The present study aims to test the performance of data-driven models in a scarce data regime.Validation was conducted using dwell times dt = {30, 60} seconds, while testing was performed ondt = {45, 75} seconds. In particular, for the POD-GPR model, there is no separate validation set;both validation and test sets are combined into a single test set. The current selection of validationand test sets focuses on evaluating the performance of these models within the interpolation range ofthe parameters. In future work, we plan to extend the parameter space to include the extrapolationrange, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of the models generalization capabilities. Our implementation of POD successfully preserved 99.99% of the variance with 129 modes. Subse-quently, 129 independent GPRs were trained. The performance of the first four POD coefficientscorresponding to the test dwell times is visually represented in the . : Graphical representation of the first four POD coefficients of final layer predicted by theGPR model for various dwell times in the test set (dt = {30, 45, 60, 75} seconds) along with the 95%confidence interval. The industry standard for accuracy in additive manufacturing processes is within 0.1 mm. OurPOD-GPR model significantly exceeds this requirement, achieving an accuracy of 0.001 mm for themaximum displacement value, showcasing an excellent agreement with the finite element simulations.Notably, the runtime for the POD-GPR is approximately 4 seconds, providing a computationalspeed-up of about 1800 times compared to traditional finite-element methods. The parameterized GCA was trained within a denoising autoencoder framework, employing earlystopping with a patience of 50 epochs and cosine annealing warm restarts for learning rateadjustment to optimize training and mitigate overfitting. The AdamW optimizer was used forparameter updates. Despite setting the latent space dimension to 12 for a detailed yet compact datarepresentation, the GCA showed tendencies of overfitting, attributed to the limited dataset size of onlynine training points. This limited dataset impaired the models generalization capabilities, particularlynoticeable in test performance for dwell times of 45s and 75s. contrasts displacementpredictions from the POD-GPR and GCA models against finite element simulations. The figure andresults underscore the POD-GPR models superior performance, highlighting its greater accuracy andeffectiveness in distortion prediction for additive manufacturing.",
  "Conclusion": "This study highlights the POD-GPR models exceptional accuracy and computational efficiency indistortion prediction, achieving accuracies within 0.001 mm and a 1800-fold speed improvement,demonstrating its suitability for engineering applications. While the parameterized GCA model faceschallenges in generalizing due to a limited dataset, its versatility in adapting to different geometriesindicates significant potential for broader uses. Future work will focus on enhancing the GCA modelwith an enlarged dataset and exploring advanced non-linear methods such as weak-LaSDI .",
