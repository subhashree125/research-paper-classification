  "Abstract": "We study the potential of symbolic regression (SR) to derive compact and preciseanalytic expressions that can improve the accuracy and simplicity of phenomeno-logical analyses at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). As a benchmark, we apply SRto equation recovery in quantum electrodynamics (QED), where established analyt-ical results from quantum field theory provide a reliable framework for evaluation.This benchmark serves to validate the performance and reliability of SR beforeextending its application to structure functions in the Drell-Yan process mediatedby virtual photons, which lack analytic representations from first principles. Bycombining the simplicity of analytic expressions with the predictive power of ma-chine learning techniques, SR offers a useful tool for facilitating phenomenologicalanalyses in high energy physics.",
  "Introduction": "SR is a machine learning task that discovers symbolic models by searching for simple analyticexpressions that minimise both prediction error and model complexity. Unlike traditional methods,SR does not fit parameters to a potentially overparametrised model but instead finds concise formulasto describe data. This approach combines the power of machine learning with the clarity of analyticalexpressions, enabling the extraction of simple formulas from potentially complex datasets. In LHC physics, some quantities have analytic expressions, while others require expensive fits oriterative algorithms for evaluation, lacking universally known formulas. Previous studies have appliedSR in LHC contexts , often comparing the derived models to known analytical results. However,a key motivation for this work arises in scenarios where no reference expression exists, promptingthe need to assess the reliability of SR methods. The structure of this work is as follows. Sect. 2 briefly introduces the basics of SR. Sect. 3 validatesthe methodology by recovering known analytical expressions from noisy data. Sect. 4 presents anSR-derived result for the Drell-Yan structure function with virtual photons, which cannot be obtainedfrom first principles. We conclude in Sect. 5.",
  "Symbolic regression": "SR is a supervised learning method that discovers closed-form analytical expressions for input-outputrelationships without completely predefined functional forms . Unlike linear regression orneural networks, SR optimises simultaneously for both accuracy and simplicity. We use the PySR package , a multipopulation evolutionary algorithm that evaluates symbolicexpressions as expression trees. It can be highly effective for parameter spaces of moderate size . shows an example tree representing the equation 3.1y (x2 + 1). In this study, equations are",
  "Trees can also combine through crossover, and complexity, defined by node count, is managed viamultiobjective optimisation. More details are available in the original reference": "The selection criterion in PySR guides the evolutionary algorithm in choosing the fittest expressiontrees. There are three criteria: accuracy, which selects the model with the lowest loss; score,defined as the negative derivative of log-loss with respect to complexity, selects the model withhighest decrease in loss with marginally higher complexity; and best, which selects the model withthe highest score, provided its loss does not exceed 1.5 times that of the most accurate model.",
  "2s (1 + cos2 ),(1)": "where is the angle between the outgoing muon and incoming electrons, the QED coupling, ands the squared centre-of-mass energy, treated as a constant. Radiative corrections and higher-ordereffects are not included, so is also treated as constant. SR will aim to rediscover this equation fromsimulated samples. To train the regressor, we generate 100k events at s = 1 TeV using MADGRAPH5_AMC@NLO without kinematic cuts. From these events, we extract cos distributions for various binnings andshow the corresponding samples to the regressor. As Eq. ( 1) indicates, cos is the key kinematicvariable. In Tab. 1, we present the analytical equations derived from the simulated distributions for differentbinnings. Comparing with Eq. (1), we observe that the accuracy criterion often fails to recover theequation across different binning levels, fitting the noise. In contrast, best, successfully recovers thecorrect equation with finer binning. Notably, score consistently identifies the correct equation, evenwith very fine binning, demonstrating that simplicity can be an effective factor. Realistic simulations must account for uncertainties and fluctuations in the data. Figs. 3 and 4 showthe absolute and normalised distributions for 30 bins, comparing the simulations central value (with1-standard deviation Poisson uncertainty at the level of the event count in each bin), the SR result,",
  "Proton structure functions": "Parton distribution functions (PDFs) are essential for calculating observables at hadron colliders, asdiscussed in and references therein. They represent momentum distribution of partons withinhadrons, which must be combined with partonic cross sections to produce physical predictions tocompare with experimental data. PDFs cannot be calculated from first principles, as they encapsulatethe non-perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics where the strong coupling becomes toolarge for perturbative methods to converge. Instead, PDFs have to be fitted from experimental data.This is achieved at the state of the art by using fixed functional forms or neural networks withhundreds of trainable weights . Many differential observables depend on structure functions (SFs), which are weighted combinationsof PDFs . Like PDFs themselves, SFs lack closed analytical expressions. In this section, weintroduce the first SR approach to derive SFs. Our goal is to obtain accurate and compact analyticalexpressions that can effectively model these functions, offering a more straightforward and clearunderstanding of their behaviour compared to current techniques.",
  "M F(M, y),": "(2)where M and y are, respectively, the invariant mass and the rapidity of the muon pair, x1 = eyand x2 = ey are the parton momentum fractions that cannot be bigger than 1, and = M 2/s.The sum in parentheses runs over the q = u, d, s, c quark flavours, Qq is their respective electriccharge, and fq are their associated PDFs. We are exclusively interested in the SF F(M, y) at highresolution in the kinematic coverage as the rest of the distribution is known. The SF values from the simulation are shown in , calculated by reweighting the doubledifferential distribution with the prefactor13s823M as per Eq. (2). Applying SR to this distributionyields a hall-of-fame set of models at various complexities, with selected examples shown in .The best model, with a complexity of 33 (highlighted in gray), is shown in . These results arecompared to the central replica values of the PDF set, shown in . From the figures, we observe",
  ": SF F(M, y) values obtained with SR": "that the SR result provides a smooth function that approximates well the PDF grid. It successfullyextrapolates to the unphysical regions of the kinematic coverage by suppressing the function (althoughit does not fully reach zero) and effectively reduces fluctuations at high invariant mass M. Moreover,the expressions in the table show that the SF can be parametrised at low complexity (3) using inversepower laws in M. At higher complexities, where there is resolution in y, the SR recognises that it must be symmetric in y, as dictated by particle kinematics. Notably, the most complex expression(complexity 35), while more accurate by construction, achieves a lower score due to increasedexpression length.",
  "ni=1(yi y)2 ,": "where n is the number of data points, yi the actual value, yi the predicted value, and y the mean of yi.We see that SR achieves lower RMSE and MAE values, indicating a better overall fit quality withthe PDF grid. Additionally, the higher R2 value for the SR fit (0.9030 vs. 0.8898) reflects a strongercorrelation. These results demonstrate the capability of SR to model the data with good precision.",
  "Conclusion": "We have explored the application of SR to derive simple yet accurate analytical formulas in the contextof collider phenomenology. Using well-established QED processes as a benchmark, we validatedthe reliability of SR by recovering known analytical expressions from noisy data under varyingconditions. Furthermore, we extended this methodology to SFs in Drell-Yan, showing the potentialof SR to provide accurate and simple results even in scenarios where no closed-form solutions areavailable. This study highlights the utility of SR in simplifying and enhancing the analysis of complexdatasets in high energy physics, and could be extended to study more sophisticated uncertainties,higher-dimensional distributions, or higher-order processes like those involving electroweak bosonproduction with angular coefficients . SR combines machine learning with analytical expressions, enabling accurate closed-form modelsfrom complex datasets. This work contributes to precision physics at the LHC and, more in general,machine learning-assisted discovery in high energy physics.",
