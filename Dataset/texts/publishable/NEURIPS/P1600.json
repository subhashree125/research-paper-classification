  "Abstract": "Reinforcement learning based fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) onhuman preferences has been shown to enhance both their capabilities and safetybehavior. However, in cases related to safety, without precise instructions to humanannotators, the data collected may cause the model to become overly cautious,or to respond in an undesirable style, such as being judgmental. Additionally, asmodel capabilities and usage patterns evolve, there may be a costly need to add orrelabel data to modify safety behavior. We propose a novel preference modelingapproach that utilizes AI feedback and only requires a small amount of humandata. Our method, Rule Based Rewards (RBR), uses a collection of rules fordesired or undesired behaviors (e.g. refusals should not be judgmental) along witha LLM grader. In contrast to prior methods using AI feedback, our method usesfine-grained, composable, LLM-graded few-shot prompts as reward directly in RLtraining, resulting in greater control, accuracy and ease of updating. We show thatRBRs are an effective training method, achieving an F1 score of 97.1, comparedto a human-feedback baseline of 91.7, resulting in much higher safety-behavioraccuracy through better balancing usefulness and safety.",
  "Introduction": "As large language models (LLMs) grow in capabilities and prevalence, it becomes increasinglyimportant to ensure their safety and alignment. Much recent work has focused on using humanpreference data to align models, such as the line of work on reinforcement learning from humanfeedback (RLHF). However, there are many challenges in using human feedback alone toachieve a target safety specification. Collecting and maintaining human data for model safety isoften costly and time-consuming, and the data can become outdated as safety guidelines evolve withmodel capability improvements or changes in user behaviors. Even when requirements are relativelystable, they can still be hard to convey to annotators. This is especially the case for safety, wheredesired model responses are complex, requiring nuance on whether and how to respond to requests. Ifinstructions are underspecified, annotators may have to rely on personal biases, leading to unintendedmodel behaviors, such as becoming overly cautious, or it responding in an undesirable style (e.g.being judgmental). For example, some annotators in one of our experiments, when ranking possibleresponses to user requests pertaining to self-harm, favored completions that referred the user to aUS suicide hotline phone number, which would not have helped users in other regions. Fixing suchissues often requires relabeling or collecting new data, which is expensive and time consuming. To address these issues, methods that use AI feedback have recently gained popularity, mostprominently Constitutional AI . These methods use AI feedback to synthetically generate trainingdata to combine with the human data for the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reward model (RM)training steps. However, in Bai et al. and other methods, the constitution involves general",
  "arXiv:2411.01111v1 [cs.AI] 2 Nov 2024": "guidelines like \"choose the response that is less harmful\", leaving the AI model a large amount ofdiscretion to decide what is harmful. For real world deployments, we need to enforce much moredetailed policies regarding what prompts should be refused, and with what style. In this work, we introduce a novel AI feedback method that allows for detailed human specification ofdesired model responses, similar to instructions one would give to a human annotator. We break downthe desired behavior into specific rules that explicitly describe the desired and undesired behaviors(e.g. \"refusals should contain a short apology\", \"refusals should not be judgemental toward the user\",, \"responses to self-harm conversations should contain an empathetic apology that acknowledgesthe users emotional state.\"). This separation into rules is similar to the human feedback methodproposed in Sparrow, however we focus on utilizing AI feedback as opposed to human feedback.The specificity of these rules allow for fine grained control of model responses and high automatedLLM classification accuracy. We combine LLM classifiers for individual behaviors to cover complexbehaviors. Additionally, in contrast to prior AI and human feedback methods that distill behaviorrules into either a synthetic or human labelled dataset for RM training, we incorporate this feedbackdirectly during RL training as additional reward, avoiding a potential loss of behavior specificationthat can occur when distilling the rules into the RM. Main Contributions and Results In this work, we propose a scalable and flexible method, safetyRBRs, that allows for fine grained control of model responses in the case of well specified model-behavior policies. 1. We empirically demonstrate that RBRs achieve comparable safety performance as human-feedback baselines while substantially decreasing instances of over-refusals on safe prompts.Specifically, on an F1 score calculated between safety and usefulness, RBRs achieve a scoreof 97.1, compared to a human-feedback baseline of 91.7 and a helpful-baseline of 95.8.",
  "Related Works": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): Research in RLHF methods demonstrates the efficacy of human annotations in steering model behavior. A subset ofthis RLHF research considers achieving better safety behavior through methods such as separatingout signals of helpfulness and harmlessness. Similarly, we also focus on improving model safety, butfocus on fast and scalable automated methods that leverage AI feedback. Most related to our work,Sparrow proposes a novel approach to RLHF which trains a second rule-conditioned RM to detectpotential rule violations. Like Sparrow, we also use rules, but we have a few key differences. Sparrowfocuses on utilizing human data and they collect more than 14K human-annotated conversations. Weinstead focus on utilizing AI feedback. Additionally, our approach involves fitting a model to ensurethat the final reward effectively and correctly ranks completions which Sparrow does not. Lastly,we skip the step of distilling rules into RM data and focus on incorporating the rule as directly aspossible into PPO training. Reinforcement Learning From AI Feedback (RLAIF) To address the cost and time of collectinghuman data, work that uses AI feedback to improve models have been a topic of recent study in bothsafety (such as CAI ), and non-safety settings (RLAIF ). These methods look at generatingsynthetic comparison datasets using AI feedback that is used to train a reward model. In contrast,instead of synthetically generating comparison datasets, we look at incorporating LLM feedbackdirectly into the RL procedure. We additionally differ by using fine-grained and composable rulesof desired behavior which allows for increased controllability of the model refusal behavior andresponses. Our setting comes with a different set of challenges which we study, such as how to bestcombine the LLM feedback with the reward model. Additional Related Methods: Additional related work include studies on improving the final outputsor finetuning on top of a model(. However, we consider a different setting as we aim to buildsafety behavior into the model via RL training. Our approach is also loosely related to work thatconsiders different ways of designing rewards for LLMs, such as RAFT .",
  "Setting and Terminology": "We consider a production setup of an AI chatbot system where a pretrained large language model(LLM) is periodically finetuned to align to an updated behavior specification, using a standard pipelineof first supervised fine-tuning (SFT) the model and then applying reinforcement learning from humanpreferences (RLHF). At the RLHF stage, we first train a reward model (RM) from preference dataand then train the LLM against the RM via an reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm like PPO .We assume that we already have: Helpful-only SFT demonstrations contains examples of helpful conversations. Helpful-only RM preference data tracks comparisons pairs between chatbot re-sponses, where in each comparison a human annotator has ranked the completions basedsolely on their helpfulness to the user. This set has data has no examples where the user asksfor potentially unsafe content.",
  "Additionally, we assume we have:": "A Moderation Model: For both human feedback baselines and automated methods weneed a method of obtaining relevant safety RL prompts. We assume we have an automatedmoderation model that can detect if text contains a request or a depiction of various unsafecontent. Pre-existing models such as ModerationAPI can be used. In this work wetrain a model similarly to ModerationAPI which we will refer to as ModAPI. If no suchmoderation model exists to detect the undesired safety policy, additional work may beneeded to obtain labels (such as prompt tuning a LLM based classifier). Safety-relevant RL prompts (Ps): A dataset of conversations ending in a user turn,some of which end with a user request for unsafe content. To combat potential overrefusals,this additionally includes user requests that should be complied with, including boundarycases (e.g. classification of harmful content) and helpful-only prompts (see Appendix A.1.2for details and breakdowns). This set of prompts can be curated and labelled using theModeration Model. We used a total of 6.7k conversations. Furthermore, we assume that a process of deliberation has occurred between relevant stakeholders toproduce both a newly-updated content policy (a taxonomy that defines precisely what content ina prompt is considered an unsafe request) and a behavior policy (a set of rules governing how themodel should in principle handle various kinds of unsafe requests defined in the content policy). Thespecifics of designing appropriate content and behavior policies is out of scope for this work. Weaim to align the model in a way that maximizes helpfulness while also adhering to our content andbehavior policy in a way that is efficient in both cost and time.",
  "Content and Behavior Policies in Our Experiments": "For our experiments, we use a simplified example content policy that addresses several kinds of unsafecontent relevant to an LLM deployed as a chat model. There are many other categories of harmfulcontent that should be covered by a comprehensive, production level, content policy. Although thepolicy itself is not comprehensive, it has a level of granularity appropriate to a production setting. Adetailed description of the content and behavior policies can be found in the appendix A.3, but wegive a brief summary here. The content policy classifies user requests by content area and categorywithin the content area. In our example, we consider four content policy areas: Erotic Content(which we will abbreviate C), Hate Speech (H), Criminal Advice (K), and Self-Harm (SH). Categories within the content policy are used to determine the behavior policy which outlines theideal response type. We consider three response types (see appendix A.3 for examples): HardRefusals: the ideal response includes a brief apology and a statement of inability to comply with theusers request, without excess verbosity. Soft Refusals: the ideal response includes a more nuancedand specialized response. For example, in the self-harm case, we would like the model to give anempathetic apology that acknowledges the users emotional state, but ultimately declines to complywith the users request for methods of self harm. Comply: the model should comply with the userrequest. (This applies to our safety boundary and \"normal\" prompts in Ps.)",
  ": The RBR is combined with the helpful-only RM score during RL training": "The appropriate response type for a given user request varies by content policy category - we definethis mapping as the behavior policy. To combat overrefusals, we include content policy categoriesthat capture the safety boundary within a content policy area: the often complex line betweenwhats considered acceptable or unacceptable for a model to engage with. For example, users mayrequest that the model classify text that is about harmful material without asking the model to directlygenerate new harmful content. In these cases, the behavior policy may require the model to comply.",
  "Rule-Based Rewards for Safety": "In this section, we describe Rule-Based Rewards (RBRs), our proposed approach to building safetyreward functions for RL training based on a content and behavior policy. We also provide codeand example synthetic data for fitting the reward combination models described in this section2. Tomotivate our approach, given a content and behavior policy, consider what researchers must do toprepare labeling instructions for safety data annotators. The researchers have to write a list of naturallanguage rules for defining a good completion and scoring completions with undesirable features,taking great care to ensure that instructions are specific enough that different annotators will producethe same judgements. For example, consider collecting data that scores completions from 1-7. Fora request that should be hard-refused, a simplified version of a rule in our example can be: \"rankcompletions with a short apology and statement of inability highest at 7, deduct 1 point for eachundesirable refusal quality (such as judgemental language) that is present, if the refusal containsdisallowed content rank it lowest at 1\". Researchers often also have to provide illustrative examples.These instructions and examples are ideal for use in a few-shot LLM classification task. In our observations, LLMs demonstrate higher accuracy when asked to classify specific, individualtasks, such as determining whether a text contains an apology, compared to general, multilayered taskssuch as rating completions given a large content and behavior policy as input. To leverage this strength,we simplified these complex policies into a series of individual binary tasks, termed propositions.We then established a set of rules that determine when combinations of these propositions truthvalues are desired or undesired. This framework allows us to accurately rank completions usingthese classification rules. In order to combine safety rule-based rankings with a helpful-only RM in aprincipled way, we use them to fit an auxiliary safety reward function that takes only proposition-basedfeatures as input, which we refer to as the Rule-Based Reward. We add the RBR to the helpful-onlyRM to use as the total reward in RLHF, as shown in . In the subsections that follow, wedescribe an inner loop of fitting RBR weights given features, to be interleaved with an outer loop ofevaluating the effectiveness of the total combined reward, and potentially modifying the fitting setup(e.g. changing the model for combining the rewards).",
  ": Simplified example ranking rules": "A rule determines the ranking of acompletion given a prompt. For eachtarget response type (hard refusal, saferefusal, or comply), there is a set ofrules that govern the relative rankingsof desired and undesired propositionsfor the completion. We illustrate thisin , where we show an exam-ple of hypothetical rules for rankingtiers of hard refusal and comply be-haviors. For a given prompt, comple-tions that satisfy the ideal rule rankhigher than less_good which rankhigher than unacceptable comple-tions. We give a short example list of propositions in and provide full details on thepropositions and rules we used in . : A subset of propositions used in our Safety RBR. (See Appendix for the full list)ApologyResponse contains a short apology.(e.g. \"Im sorry...\")RefusesExpresses an unambiguous statement of inability to comply.(e.g. \"I cant help with that.\")JudgmentalResponse contains judgmental language that criticizes the users requestor their moral or ethical values.(e.g. \"That request is reprehensible.\")Illogical ContinuationNonsensical response which does not logically follow the conversation.(e.g. \"Lets talk about something else. Do you like pizza?\")CompliesProvides a response to at least some part or aspect of the request.(e.g. \"I can help with that. The answer may be...\")HelpfulProvides a complete and accurate response to the request.(e.g. \"Certainly! The capital of France ...\", \"Here are steps to build abomb...\") Features, Graders, and Classification-Prompts: We define a feature as any numerical value that isdetermined by a prompt and a completion to that prompt. We will denote as i(p, c) where p is theprompt, c is the completion and i is the index of the feature. In this work, we include two differenttype of features, however features are flexible and can be any numerical value: The first type of features we use are the probabilities of a proposition being true as judged by agrader LLM with a few-shot classification-prompt. These classification-prompts contain naturallanguage descriptions of the content and behavior policy and instructions to only output the tokensyes or no. We then use the probabilities of the outputting tokens yes or no to estimate a probabilityof the proposition being true for a completion. in the Appendix maps which propositionprobabilities were used as features for each behavior category. The design of these prompts requiresiteration and the choice of grader LLM is also highly impactful. In our experiments, we use ahelpful-only SFT model which showed higher precision when labeling disallowed content. The second type of features we use are the more general \"class\" features as illustrated in (ex.\"ideal\")3. These classes allow us to group sets of propositions into distinguishable names that areshared across all Response-Types. We calculate the probability of each class for each completion bymultiplying the relevant propositions attached to each class (See Appendix ) and normalizingacross classes. We then use the probabilities of each class as features.",

Our process for converting a behaviorpolicy into a pipeline that generates labeled completions.

A Small Set of Human Labelled Data for Prompt Tuning: To tune the classification-promptsmentioned above, we synthetically generate a small dataset of conversations ending in assistant turnsto have diverse representation across our safety categories and propositions. We give an overview ofthe process used to generate this data in . Then, we researchers manually label the truthinessof each proposition for the final assistant completion of each conversation. We refer to this labelledset as the Gold set. We manually labelled a total of 518 completions across the three behaviorcategories to tune the grader prompts for RBRs: 268 for Comply, 132 for Hard Refusal, and 118 forSoft Refusal.

  "(1)": "Synthetic Comparison Data For Weight Fitting: We synthetically generate data to create a setof comparison data, DRBR, for fitting the RBR weights w. To fit the weights, for each prompt pi,we need a set of k diverse completions (ci,j) per prompt that have different rankings: DRBR ={(pi, ci,1, ci,2, ..., ci,k)}i=1,...,|DRBR|, and ranking order between completions (e.g. ci,1 > ci,2 =ci,3 > ci,4...) of how good the completion is. Our setup with propositions lets us easily generateexactly the data needed, conditioned on the content and behavior policy. We can use the naturallanguage descriptions we already have to prompt for diverse completions with various rankings.For example, for a prompt that should be hard refused, we can decide we want the following set of4 completions: one perfect hard refusal (ideal), two bad completions with randomly sampled badrefusal traits, such as judgement and/or illogical continuation, and one that contains the requesteddisallowed content. The goal is to have synthetic completions representing an ideal completion, a fewdiverse sub-optimal completions, and an unacceptable completion for every prompt.",

The default reward model, Rrm, that will be used during RL training.3. DRBR, the RBR weight fitting comparison dataset described above. The RBR fitting procedure is straightforward: first, use the content and behavior policy rules todetermine rankings among completions based on their proposition values. Then, optimize the RBRweights so that the total reward achieves the target ranking. We do this by minimizing a hinge loss:",
  "where ca, cb are any two completions corresponding to p such that ca cb (ca ranks better than cbunder the content and behavior policy)": "For all our experiments we used the same number of datapoints as PPO prompts to fit the weights.However the number of parameters in a linear RBR is just the number of relevant propositions + thefive class probabilities, which is tiny by comparison to the number of parameters in a standard RLHFRM. Fewer examples are probably required and we discuss this later in the discussion .1.Because there are only a small number of optimizable parameters, fitting an RBR is extremely fast(can run on a standard laptop in a couple of minutes). We discuss hyperparameters used in fittingRBRs in the Appendix Section A.1.3 and other alternate ways of combining the RBR with the RM (manually setting weights) in Appendix Section A.2.",
  "Outer Loop: Evaluating the Final Reward Signal and Tuning": "Even before running RL and evaluating the final model, we can measure how good a reward functionis by using the held-out test set of the weight fitting data DRBR, and checking whether the rewardfunction enforces the target rankings on that data. Through these evaluations, we can see if we needto make changes to the weight fitting procedure such as potentially adding additional features orchanging the model (e.g. to a non-linear model). In a, we plot histograms of two differentreward functions for various responses to prompts that demand hard refusals. To account for the factthat different prompts may have different base rewards (Rrm), we center the rewards: given a promptand its set of k = 4 completions, we subtract out the reward of the ideal completion from each of thethree other completions. We can see the helpful-only RM itself does not have any separation/rankingbetween ideal (perfect refusal), slighly bad (bad refusal), and really bad (disallowed) completions.Adding the RBR (RM + RBR) allows for separation and correct ranking - ranking ideal over slightbad over really bad completions. We provide more reward distribution histograms for all responsetypes in the Appendix . We can additionally look at the error rate of the RM which quantifies the number of mistakes wherea non-ideal completion was ranked above the ideal completion as a percentage of all comparisonsthat involve an ideal completion. To have a metric focused on only correct behavior, we calculate this",

(b) The error rate tracks how frequently a non-ideal completion is ranked above the idealcompletion for different reward model setups. using only comparisons that involve the ideal completion, and do not consider whether we correctlyranked two non-ideal completions (e.g. bad refusal > disallowed). In b, we see using theRBRs with the RM greatly reduced the error rates across all response types.",
  "Helpful-Only Baseline: The helpful-only baseline are the SFT, RM, and PPO models trained withour helpful-only RLHF datasets following a procedure similar to that described in Ouyang et al": "Human Safety Data Baseline: In addition to our helpful-only data, we add human-annotatedsafety data for our set of safety-relevant RL prompts Ps. We send these prompts to annotators whoare familiar with our content and behavior policies and have been actively labelling similar safetyprompts under similar instructions for several months. We follow the standard RLHF comparisondata collection procedure and ask annotators to sample 4 completions and label them with a ratingfrom 1-7. The annotators had access to a helpful-only SFT model as well as system prompts (e.g. toprompt for perfect refusals) to sample completions from. As part of the instructions, annotators weregiven detailed guidelines on completion scoring. For example, for a prompt that should be refused, aperfect hard refusal should be rated 7, bad refusals (ex. excessively verbose) should be rated lower,and completions with disallowed content should be rated 1. Annotators were also asked to try tomaximize the diversity of scores across the 4 completions by resampling individual completions ifnecessary. They were also asked to provide an \"ideal\" completion, either by copying and pasting anexisting completion, or by writing an original one. We assume this ideal completion is rated 7, andfrom this we can construct comparison data for RM training. Additionally we use the prompts andideal completions for SFT training. The amount of human safety data is a small amount, about 3% ofSFT data and 1% of RM data when combined with the Helpful-Only datasets.",
  "Results after RL training are often high variance, so for all evaluation scores reported, we evaluate on5 checkpoints toward the end of PPO training and report the average mean and standard error": "Internal Safety RBR Evaluation: We evaluate our models on a diverse set of internal prompts whichare manually labeled by researchers with our content policy category (see ). In total, there are588 Comply, 565 Hard-Refusal, and 185 Soft-Refusal prompts which are approximately distributedevenly across categories. We use the classifications of the Safety RBRs propositions to automaticallyevaluate three internal metrics: Not-Unsafe: the percentage of completions which do not contain any disallowed content. Not-Overrefuse: the percentage of completions for Comply prompts which are not refusals. Hard-Refusal-Style: the percentage of completions in the ideal style for Hard-Refusalprompts (i.e. no incorrect response elements). We note that for this evaluation there is some overlap with our training signal. There are importantdifferences in the signals: there is no overlap in prompts between our train and evaluation sets.Additionally, for evaluations we do not use the RBRs as described in training. Instead we convertthe output probability scores for each proposition into binary labels using a threshold optimized onthe Gold set. These binary labels are converted to metric output via simple metric definitions. Forexample, Hard-Refusal-Style is True when a completion is mapped to ideal and False when it isnot. Thus, there is no weight fitting, and only the raw proposition probabilities are used for behaviorclassification metrics. We realize however there may still be correlated errors because of the repeatRBR usage. To mitigate this, we show that our RBR has high accuracy on an our Gold set (and Appendix ). We also provide additional methods of safety evaluation described below. XSTest: To measure the overrefusal rate of our models on publicly available prompts, we evaluate ourmodels on the Comply prompts in XSTest . These prompts challenge safety behavior with lexiconthat models can become overly sensitive to (e.g. \"How can I kill a Python process?\"). We filtered52 prompts for being outside the scope of our content policy, resulting in 198 relevant overrefusalprompts. We measure overrefusal rate using both our Not-Overrefuse RBR-based metric and thedefault XSTest classification prompt using GPT-4. WildChat: To measure the safety of our models on publicly available prompts, we leverage Wild-Chat . Specifically, we filter this dataset to unsafe prompts using ModAPI, resulting in a sample of790 unsafe prompts. We evaluate the safety of the completions using three automated tools: ModAPI,our Not-Unsafe RBR-based metric, and Llama Guard 2 . To reduce noise, we sample 5completions per prompt at temperature 1.0 and average the evaluations. Human Safety Evaluations: To further verify our safety evaluations, we ran human evaluationsof safety behavior. The human evaluators are researchers on the team who have much experiencewith and are extremely familiar with the Content and Behavior policy. We start with prompts fromWildChat which we filter using ModAPI . To measure over-refusals, we also include 198 Complyprompts from XSTest. For each prompt, a completion was sampled from each of the Helpful-PPObaseline, Human-PPO baseline, and RBR-PPO models. Model names were hidden from the evaluatorsand the order of completions shown was randomized. Evaluators were asked to label the desiredResponse-Type of each prompt and the actual Response-Type of each completion. According tothe prompt labels of human evaluators, the final dataset contained 283 Comply prompts and 70Hard-Refusal prompts in total. Capability Evaluations: To monitor model capabilities, we evaluate our models on MMLU (Averaged across zero-shot, 10-shot, and zero-shot CoT), HellaSwag (Zero-shot), GPQA (Few-shot CoT averaged across 1-, 5-, and 10-repeats on Diamond), and Lambada (Zero-shot).For speed purposes we evaluate against large subsets of these datasets.",

In we give the resultsof both our human and automated internal safety evaluations on Large sized models. We see thatunder both evaluations, RBRs (RBR-PPO) are able to substantially increase safety while minimallyimpacting the amount of over-refusals, achieving the highest F1-score. The human safety databaseline, Human-PPO, increases safety greatly, however at the expense of also greatly increasing theamount of over-refusals (by almost 14% in the human evaluation).

Interestingly enough, we note thatHelpful-PPO improves upon safety compared to Helpful-SFT, even though the Helpful-Onlydatasets do not contain any safety-relevant data. We hypothesize this is due to the Helpful-Onlydatasets generally encouraging the model to be polite, which may be correlated to safety.

Additionally we apply the safety RBR ontop of a RM trained with outdated safety data (Old Data-PPO), which also has a high over-refusalrate. Applying the RBR both improves safety and reduces overrefusals by 10%. Safety RBRs require less human annotated data than the Human-Data Baseline.

The subsampling processis constrained to ensure even representation amongst behavior types and content categories. PPOprompts remains the same as that of the RBR runs (i.e. the full set of RL prompts). We note this isnot a direct comparison because the set of annotators for the two datasets is different, but it providesa ballpark estimate. In b, we plot the result as Human-match RBR-PPO. Compared toRBR-PPO and Human-PPO, this run performs slightly worse on both Not-Unsafe and Not-Overrefuse.We hypothesize this is because the small amount of RM data is not enough to teach the model therefusal boundary.",
  "RBR Training Ablations": "In this section, we present various ablation experiments.

As with the main results, for all experiments, we fix all variables to that in thedefault setting as described in .3 except the variable being studied. Scaling RBR Grader Engine Size. a shows how performance changes with differentmodel sizes. We see that in general, safety stays about constant as the grader engine increases insize. Additionally we see that over-refusals decrease with larger grader engines. Interestingly, wesee hard-refusal style take a U shaped pattern. For small grader engines, it seems the dominantencouraged behavior is refusal and the trained model learns to refuse well. As the grader engineincreases in capability, it is able to learn to refuse less often, however it is not able to capture goodstyle. Until for the largest model, it is able to perform well on both. Scaling Safety Prompts Percentage. We vary the percentage of safety-relevant prompts that wouldbe seen during PPO training (where 100% means all PPO prompts are seen), shown in b. Ingeneral, safety increases with more safety prompts during RL training, while over-refusals slightlyincrease as well. Refusal style benefits the most from seeing more safety prompts.",
  "Scaling the Hard-Refusal/Comply Ratio. We vary the ratio of Hard-Refusal to Comply promptsduring RL training in c. We see a clear safety vs over-refusal trade-off as the ratio changes": "Improving Self Harm Refusal Style For our default parameters, we found poor performance forsoft refusal style. We found we can improve soft refusal style without impacting other safety metricsby adjusting the prompt ratio. In d we show increasing the percentage of Soft Refusalprompts seen from the default amount of approximately 1/4th the amount of Comply prompts toapproximately matching the amount of Comply prompts. (As a reminder there are about the sameamount of Hard-Refusal prompts as Comply prompts). We see Soft-Refusal style improves withoutnegatively impacting other safety-behavior. Weight Fitting Data Amount While we generate synthetic completions for weight fitting using allthe PPO prompts we have, we hypothesize we need less data as we are fitting a model with a smallnumber of parameters. We investigate this in e by investigating the error rate (as described in.3) and the number of prompts used (where there are four synthetic completions per prompt).We see that approximately 300 prompts per category is sufficient for low error rate. Various Other Ablations In f we ablate omitting certain steps and we observe that this let usfall on different regions along the Pareto frontier. SFTonly-noRBR-PPO considers training SFT fromthe RBR synthetic SFT data combined with Helpful SFT data, but only training with the Helpful-RMwith RBRs from there. It leads to a moderate improvement in safety over Helpful-PPO but not asmuch as RBR-PPO. RBR-noSFT-PPO looks at not using the synthetic SFT data and starting fromHelpful-SFT, it does well on safety but over-refuses more. RBR-noRM-PPO uses only the RBRreward for prompts in Ps with no RM score (prompts outside of Ps still use the RM score). We seethis also increase over-refusals slightly.",
  ":Average Rewardof comply and refusal com-pletions for different RMs oncomply prompts": "Distilling a set of instructions into RM data, whether through humanlabelling of comparison data or synthetic AI means, is challengingsince one must ensure not only that the data covers all instructions,but also that it is balanced such that the desired behavior is learnedby the RM. We encountered issues related to this and needed anadditional data-fixing step for the human data. After our first PPOrun using the human data, we observed the model to be extremelycautious, over-refusing on every Comply prompt in our evaluation set(and also achieving a perfect score on safety). We discovered thiswas due to an insufficient number of low-ranked refusal examplesin the RM comparison data for Comply prompts to teach the modelnot to refuse safe prompts. Although we instructed annotators tocollect diverse completions for each prompt, our initial instructionsdid not specify what percentage of Comply prompts should containa refusal example. Only a third of Comply data contained negativeexamples, leading to 3 times more positive refusal examples thannegative refusal examples. Even though the safety data was only 1%of the RM dataset when combined with the Helpful-Only data, thisimbalance was still enough to cause over-refusals on all prompts. Tocorrect for this in the RM data, for all Comply data, we manuallyreplaced a non-ideal completion with a refusal sampled from amanually created list of 50 refusals, and were able to train a second model that did not refuseeverything to use as the human-data baseline. (Note, the Human-PPO and Human-RM referred topreviously in the text are all trained with this corrected data.) In , we look at a set of safeComply prompts and plot the average rewards of completions that comply and that over-refuse forthe initial always-refusing human data RM, the corrected human data RM, and the Helpful-Only RM.We see that over-refusals are given almost the same score as helpful completions for the originalsuper-safe human data RM, making it easier to reward hack. RBRs are not subject to this issuebecause they skip this RM distillation step and directly incorporate the instructions into the rewardfunction. When a over-refusal example is sampled by the model for a safe prompt during training, itis penalized by the RBR directly. Prompt tuning for RBRs vs Human Data: Both RBRs and collecting RLHF-style human labelledcomparison data require a form of prompt tuning. For RBRs there is additionally the task of prompttuning the propositions classification-prompts to achieve high classification accuracy. For a singleproposition, this cycle involves classifying all Gold data using the current classification-prompt,evaluating the accuracy and mistakes, and iteratively updating the classification-prompt to resolvemistakes. It is often necessary to repeat this cycle a few times to achieve a high accuracy. Similarly,high-quality human data collection entails the challenges of weekly audits and reviews of a sampleof annotator labels to try to detect gaps in the instructions, and updating and communicating newinstructions to trainers if necessary. For example, while we initially instructed the annotators generallyto collect diverse completions, we had to provide additional specifications of what we meant bydiverse and to provide concrete clarifying examples throughout the data collection process. There are a few key differences between the effects of these two tasks. While improved classificationaccuracy immediately takes effect for all data, this may not be the case for human data, which mayrequire discarding data or a lengthy recollection process. Additionally, often one may not discover anissue until PPO is done training, as we did for the example above. Correcting this mistake in RBRs isgenerally a much faster iteration cycle where recollecting human data is a much slower process.",
  "Limitations, Future Work, and Ethical Considerations": "In this work, we apply Rule-based Rewards (RBRs) for RL training to a situation where the desiredbehaviors can be clearly separated into explicit, easy-to-judge propositions and rules. However, itmay be harder to apply RBRs to more subjective tasks, such as writing a high-quality essay, where defining explicit rules is less straightforward and demands nontrivial efforts. One advantage of RBRsis that they can be easily combined with human-labeled preference data in classic RLHF. As shown inthe Comply cases of this work, we used an RBR to discourage easily detectable bad behavior such asrefusals to safe prompts, while preserving capabilities through the helpful RM. This hybrid approachallows RBRs to enforce specific guidelines (e.g. \"Dont use slang in the essay example.\"), whileenabling the human-labeled data to address aspects of the task that are harder to quantify (e.g. theoverall coherence). A direction of future work is exploring these more complex non-safety domains. Ethical Considerations: In this work we discuss moving the safety feedback signal in LLM trainingfrom humans to LLMs. This reduces the level of human supervision and potentially extrapolatesand magnifies inherent biases in the LLMs. To mitigate this, researchers should carefully evaluatetheir RBRs to ensure accuracy and measure any potential biases that come up. Using this method inconjunction with human data could also help to mitigate risks.",
  "Conclusion": "In this work, we introduced a novel automated AI-feedback based preference modeling approachusing Rule-Based Rewards (RBRs) for safety training in LLMs. Our method is cost- and time-efficient, requiring minimal human data, and is easy to update if the desired model behavior changes.Our decomposition of ideal behavior into fine-grained modular rules also has unique advantages inallowing increased classification accuracy and easy synthetic data generation of diverse responsesthat is necessary for our method. Our experiments show our RBR method is able to generally achieveaccurate safety-behavior. Finding a good balance betweens safety and usefulness compared to helpfulonly human-safety data baselines.",
