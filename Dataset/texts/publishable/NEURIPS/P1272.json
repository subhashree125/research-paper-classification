  "ABSTRACT": "In response to climate change, assessing crop productivity under extreme weather conditions isessential to enhance food security. Crop simulation models, which align with physical processes,offer explainability but often perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning (ML) models for cropmodeling are powerful and scalable yet operate as black boxes and lack adherence to crop growthsphysical principles. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method that combines the strengths ofboth approaches by estimating the water use and the crop sensitivity to water scarcity at the pixellevel. This approach enables yield loss estimation grounded in physical principles by sequentiallysolving the equation for crop yield response to water scarcity, using an enhanced loss function.Leveraging Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, climate data, simulated water use data, and pixel-level yielddata, our model demonstrates high accuracy, achieving an R2 of up to 0.77matching or surpassingstate-of-the-art models like RNNs and Transformers. Additionally, it provides interpretable andphysical consistent outputs, supporting industry, policymakers, and farmers in adapting to extremeweather conditions.",

  "Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024": "data. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the RNN model on various regression metrics, such as R2 andRMSE. In detail, we demonstrate a 2 percentage point (p.p.) improvement. Compared to the Transformer model, ourmethod achieves similar results on all metrics. Only a minor decrease of 1 p.p, in R2 is observed. Additionally, weshowcase the performance of the simulation model, and highlight its weak performance to predict the actual yield losseffectively. This is because the water use cannot be predicted at the pixel level, as it depends on weather data with a30km spatial resolution. Additionally, the simulation models struggle to estimate actual water consumption with highaccuracy (see (a)). Qualitatively, (b) depicts an example yield map, showcasing accurate predictionsat pixel level with high spatial variability, close to the target data. To further assess whether the inclusion of S2 dataenhances the accuracy of crop yield loss estimation at the pixel level, we trained several models with different datamodalities. Results are depicted in , underlying the improved performance, when S2 data is used. In detail, asignificant improvement of 21 p.p. in R2 is shown over the model trained solely on weather data. (a) illustrates the sequential estimations of ETa and Ky values up to 120 days before harvest, alongsidesimulated ETx and ETa values. The Figure indicates that Ky values remain below 1, suggesting a higher resilience towater scarcity in this dataset. Furthermore, it is depicted that estimated ETa is consistently lower than the simulatedETx, indicating yield loss due to water limitation. In (b), the relationship between ET and predicted yield lossis shown. The Figure demonstrates that yield loss decreases during the growing period in correlation with increased ET,as formally defined. Additionally, yield loss predictions become more accurate as the harvest approaches.",
  "Methodology": "Problem DefinitionThe water use, also called evapotranspiration (ET), is the sum of all biophysical processes inwhich liquid water is converted to water vapor from various surfaces, including topsoil and vegetation. For a specificcrop type, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) differentiates between the maximum (ETx) and the actual ET(ETa). The former represents the water use under standard and non-limiting environmental conditions and is solelyimpacted by climate conditions and crop specifics, achieving full productivity, i.e., disease-free, well-fertilized, andunder optimum soil water conditions. In contrast, the ETa represents the water use under limiting environmentalconditions, resulting in a reduction in water use and ultimately causing a reduction of crop productivity. This reductionin productivity is defined as yield loss and typically expressed in relative terms. Various factors cause productivitylimiting conditions, including soil infertility, soil salinity, limited soil water content, diseases, and poor management.Especially, in the light of extreme weather conditions, the frequency of severe droughts and floodings is expectedto increase, causing either water scarcity or water abundance, negatively impacting ET and crop productivity [Kanget al., 2009, Arora, 2019]. Assessing the reduction in ET, is a major challenge in agriculture. A detailed description ofbiophysical processes of the ET is described by the FAO-56 method [Allen et al., 1998], using the PenmanMonteithequation, recommended for daily ET (mm/day) estimation. The ET under limiting condition is defined by:",
  ",(2)": "with Ya as the actual yield, Yx the maximum yield, or potential yield, and Ky as the crop yield response factor. Thisfactor represents the effect of a reduction in ET on the crop yield by capturing the complex relationship between cropwater use and productivity. More specifically, Ky > 1 indicates high sensitivity to water deficits with a proportionallylarger yield reduction, and Ky < 1 indicates higher resilience to water deficits. Different studies exist, that empiricallyestimated Ky coefficients for various crops. However, often reporting differences, making the equation difficult to solveanalytically. Furthermore, Ky values change over the growing period, since many crops exhibit variable susceptibilityto water scarcity over the growing period. More importantly, while ETx can be more or less accurately estimated, byfollowing [Allen et al., 1998], estimating the ETa is is very difficult with high precision, making Eq. 2 difficult to solveaccurately in reality. Architecture & EvaluationTo address this limitation, we propose to learn both ETa and Ky using a RecurrentNeural Network (RNN). We constrain the network by physical information such that the reduction in ET corresponds tothe observed reduction in yield. We argue that simulated ETx values are sufficiently accurate. This is supported byprevious studies [Cai et al., 2007], allowing us to focus at ETa and Ky at pixel resolution. We leverage an RNN, morespecifically a LSTM [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997] backbone architecture, where each hidden state is passedto a sequential layer with 128 hidden units, incorporating a linear layer, batch normalization, and dropout. Finally,two linear layers are incorporated with a single output channel each, reflecting Ky and ETa, respectively. Physicalconstraints are imposed by integrating information based on the ET and the relative reduction in crop yield, resulting ina physics-informed RNN (PI-RNN). To estimate the yield reduction at time step ti as a function of a reduction in ET, atwo component loss term is employed:Ltotal = 1Ll + 2Lphys,(3)",
