  "Abstract": "Refusals instances where large language models (LLMs) decline or fail to fullyexecute user instructions are crucial for both AI safety and AI capabilities and thereduction of hallucinations in particular. These behaviors are learned during post-training, especially in instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and reinforcement learning fromhuman feedback (RLHF). However, existing taxonomies and evaluation datasetsfor refusals are inadequate, often focusing solely on should-not-related (insteadof cannot-related) categories, and lacking tools for auditing refusal content inblack-box LLM outputs.We present a comprehensive framework for classifying LLM refusals: (a) a tax-onomy of 16 refusal categories, (b) a human-annotated dataset of over 8,600instances from publicly available IFT and RLHF datasets, (c) a synthetic datasetwith 8,000 examples for each refusal category, and (d) classifiers trained for refusalclassification.Our work enables precise auditing of refusal behaviors in black-box LLMs andautomatic analyses of refusal patterns in large IFT and RLHF datasets. Thisfacilitates the strategic adjustment of LLM refusals, contributing to the developmentof more safe and reliable LLMs.",
  "Introduction and Related Work": "Fine-tuning language models [Wei et al., 2022], particularly instruction fine-tuning (IFT) [Ouyanget al., 2022], along with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [Christiano et al., 2017,Ziegler et al., 2020, Stiennon et al., 2022] and reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF)[Bai et al., 2022b], collectively referred to as the reward model (RM) training phase, have emergedas popular techniques for enhancing the capabilities [Wang et al., 2022, Muennighoff et al., 2023]and safety [Bai et al., 2022a] of LLMs [Naveed et al., 2024, Zhang et al., 2024b]. During multipleiterations of IFT and RM, jointly referred to as the post-training phase, pairs of instructions andoutputs are used, which are usually written by human annotators or generated by LLMs [Wang et al.,2023a, Dubey et al., 2024], to either directly compute the supervised loss on the output and updatethe model parameters, or use methods such as proximal policy optimization [Schulman et al., 2017]or direct preference optimization [Rafailov et al., 2024] with relative preference labels for pairs ofoutputs. Despite the significant impact of these IFT and RM datasets on model behavior, little isknown about their composition, since they remain largely proprietary. In particular, instances ofrefusals within these datasets, which are pairs of user inputs and model outputs where the modelpartially or completely declines to comply with the instruction, have a great impact on safety behaviorand hallucination rates. [Zhang et al., 2024a]",
  "Alignment efforts by frontier labs": "Askell et al. introduce the HHH framework, which states that an assistant must be \"helpful,honest, and harmless\". An assistant should not engage in \"offensive\" or \"discriminatory\" behavior.It should also refuse to \"aid in a dangerous act[s] (e.g. building a bomb)\", and recognize when \"itmay be providing very sensitive or consequential advice and act with appropriate modesty and care\".The authors also acknowledge that \"behaviors are considered harmful and to what degree will varyacross people and cultures. It will also be context-dependent, i.e. it will depend on the nature of theuser query, who is using the AI assistant, and the time and place in which the assistant is being used\".A more precise definition of what is considered \"harmful\" is not provided. Bai et al. [2022a] use this framework to train a \"helpful and harmless\" assistant, by using humanannotators to choose the less harmful and more helpful response at each conversation turn, thereforeletting these annotators implicitly define \"helpfulness\" and \"harmlessness\" without providing a cleartaxonomy of unsafe or unsupported requests. In 2022, Google DeepMind released the Sparrow chatbot [Glaese et al., 2022], which also buildsupon the principles of Askell et al. , borrowing the HHH framework, substituting \"honest\"for \"correct\" and defining a more detailed set of rules related to each of the three principles. Theseinclude \"Stereotypes (harm)\", \"Hate and harrassment (harm)\", \"Self-anthropomorphism (harm)\",\"Misinformation (correct)\", \"Other (harm)\", and \"Other (helpful)\". Each of these categories includesseveral subcategories, such as \"no stereotypes\" and \"no microagressions\" within the \"Stereotypes(harm)\" categories. In total, the paper outlines 23 subcategories, with \"Other (harm)\" and \"Other(helpful)\" serving as catch-all categories. The paper also references Banko et al. , who define\"A Unified Typology of Harmful Content\" consisting of 13 subcategories, with several specificexamples for each subcategory. However, the specific dataset used to align the Sparrow modelremains proprietary, including the ratings of annotators. Bai et al. [2022b] build on this work by defining a \"Constitution\", a set of principles, adherence towhich is verified by an AI assistant. This allows them to train a model preferred by human evaluatorswithout collecting manually written feedback or human labels. The specific judgments made by theAI assistant relating to adherence to the \"Constitution\" on concrete examples are, again, not releasedpublicly, with only a handful of examples presented in the paper. The \"Constitution\" is specified inthe paper, along with a few example instructions given to the AI assistant to describe principles of theconstitution and verify adherence to them. The prompts used for verification include vague adjectivessuch as \"toxic\", \"dangerous\" or \"harmful\", and appeal to the models own judgment by asking it toidentify cases where instructions fit these descriptions, instead of offering a concrete and exhaustivecategorization of behaviors matching these descriptions and deciding whether the instruction fallsinto one of these categories. Similarly, OpenAIs model spec [OpenAI, 2024] defines rules such as \"comply with applicable laws\",\"dont provide information hazards\", \"protect peoples privacy\", and \"dont respond with NSFW[...] content\". Only a handful of examples and a short description of the category are provided, andthere are only 6 rules in total. The paper leaves it unclear how exactly these rules are applied whencurating the dataset the model is subsequently aligned on. In a later paper, aiming to increase ruleprecision compared to the aforementioned works, Mu et al. from OpenAI propose trainingmodels to evaluate binary propositions on conversation histories, such as \"[Contains] ThreateningLanguage\". These can then be combined into rules, which are collections of propositions and desiredvalues on them. These can be used as a direct reward on the models responses during the RM phase,such that the model complies to a content policy. The paper states \"The content policy classifiesuser requests by content area and category within the content area.\". The content policy provided inthe paper contains only four categories, with the authors disclosing that \"[they] use[d] a simplifiedexample content policy\". They also state that \"There are many other categories of harmful contentthat should be covered by a comprehensive, production level, content policy.\" However, OpenAIsproduction-level content policy, along with the datasets used to train the models on the simplifiedpolicy used in the paper, as well as the datasets for production models, was not published. Expandingthe current research landscape in this area constitutes one of our primary objectives.",
  "Several other works have proposed taxonomies of both harmful and unsupported requests, along withdatasets including safety-related content which LLMs are not allowed to generate": "RealToxicityPrompts [Gehman et al., 2020] contains 100K prompts and continuations, categorizedinto 8 kinds of toxicity: sexual content, toxicity, severe toxicity, profanity, insults, flirtation, identityattacks, and threats. The dataset does not consist of user-assistant interactions, but rather contains100K prompts and continuations of sentences generated by a language model. ToxiGen [Hartvigsenet al., 2022] contains 274K statements about 13 minority groups with binary labels of either toxicor benign. Like RealToxicityPrompts, the dataset does not consist of user-assistant interactions, butrather contains standalone statements. Wang et al. [2023b] introduce the Do-Not-Answer dataset,which contains 939 instructions that responsible LLMs should refuse to respond to. The datasetis organized into a hierarchical taxonomy covering five risk areas, 12 harm types, and 61 totalharmful scenarios. The risk areas and harm types include: Information Hazards (with harm typesRisks from leaking sensitive information and Compromise privacy), Malicious Uses (with Assistingillegal activities, Nudging users to perform unethical actions, and Reducing cost of disinformation),Discrimination, Exclusion, Toxicity (with Social stereotypes and discrimination, Toxic language, andAdult content), Misinformation Harms (with Disseminating false information and Causing materialharm through misinformation), and Human-chatbot Interaction Harms (with Mental health crisis andTreating chatbot as human). AdvBench [Huang et al., 2023] includes a dataset designed to evaluateLLM robustness against adversarial attacks, focusing on their ability to resist generating harmfulor toxic content. The dataset consists of two components: (1) 500 harmful strings reflecting toxicbehavior like profanity, graphic depictions, threats, misinformation, discrimination, cybercrime, anddangerous suggestions, and (2) 500 harmful behaviors formulated as instructions covering similarthemes. The dataset does not provide a formal categorization of these harmful behaviors and cate-gories, as they were generated using an uncensored Vicuna model (Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored)through few-shot learning from author-written examples. ToxicChat [Lin et al., 2023] contains 10,166examples of real user-AI conversations collected from interactions with the Vicuna chatbot, withbinary toxicity labels (toxic/non-toxic) and annotations for jailbreaking attempts. The dataset wasannotated through a hybrid human-AI process where moderation APIs first filtered likely non-toxiccontent (reducing annotation workload by 60%), followed by manual annotation by researchersfocusing on edge cases. The final dataset has a toxicity rate of 7.10% and a jailbreaking rate of1.75%, with annotations determined by majority vote among four annotators. MaliciousInstruct[Zou et al., 2023] contains 100 malicious instructions categorized into 10 distinct malicious intents,with 10 instructions for each intent. The malicious intent categories are psychological manipulation,sabotage, theft, defamation, cyberbullying, false accusation, tax fraud, hacking, fraud, and illegaldrug use. BeaverTails [Ji et al., 2023] includes 330K human-labeled question-answer pairs, annotatedby 70 human annotators across 14 distinct harm categories: Animal Abuse, Child Abuse, Controver-sial Topics/Politics, Discrimination/Stereotype/Injustice, Drug Abuse/Weapons/Banned Substance,Financial Crime/Property Crime/Theft, Hate Speech/Offensive Language, Misinformation RegardingEthics/Laws/Safety, Non-Violent Unethical Behavior, Privacy Violation, Self-Harm, Sexually Ex- plicit/Adult Content, Terrorism/Organized Crime, and Violence/Aiding and Abetting/Incitement. Thedataset was created through a two-stage human annotation process, where annotators first classifiedQA pairs into harm categories using a binary risk-neutrality framework (safe vs. unsafe), and thenassigned confidence scores to their decisions. XSafety [Wang et al., 2024] evaluates LLM safetyacross 10 languages with 14 safety categories: 7 typical safety scenarios (Insult, Unfairness, Crimesand Illegal Activities, Physical Harm, Mental Health, Privacy and Property, and Ethics and Morality),1 commonsense safety scenario (Physical Safety), and 6 instruction attacks (Goal Hijacking, PromptLeaking, Role Play Instruction, Unsafe Instruction Topic, Inquiry with Unsafe Opinion, and ReverseExposure). SORRY-Bench [Xie et al., 2024] introduces a taxonomy of 45 categories organized intofour main categories: Hate Speech Generation, Assistance with Crimes or Torts, Potentially Inappro-priate Topics, and Potentially Unqualified Advice. The benchmark provides an evaluation frameworkwith a dataset containing 10 instructions per category (450 instructions total) and 9,000 linguisticmutations generated with a language model. SALAD-Bench [Li et al., 2024] introduces a hierarchicaltaxonomy with 6 domains (Representation & Toxicity Harms, Misinformation Harms, Information &Safety Harms, Malicious Use, Human Autonomy & Integrity Harms, and Socioeconomic Harms),containing 16 tasks and 66 specific categories. The benchmark comprises 30,000 questions total, in-cluding 21,000 base questions, 5,000 attack-enhanced questions, 200 defense-enhanced questions, and4,000 multiple-choice questions. It was collected through a combination of crowd-sourcing and dataaugmentation techniques including rephrasing and synthetic generation. HarmBench [Mazeika et al.,2024] introduces an evaluation framework for automated red teaming of LLMs, organizing harmfulbehaviors into two major taxonomies. The semantic taxonomy comprises seven main categories:Chemical & Biological Weapons/Drugs, Copyright Violations, Misinformation & Disinformation,Harassment & Bullying, Illegal Activities, Cybercrime & Unauthorized Intrusion, and General Harm.The functional taxonomy classifies behaviors based on their evaluation context into four categories:standard behaviors (200 examples), contextual behaviors (100 examples), copyright behaviors (100examples), and multimodal behaviors (110 examples), totaling 510 unique harmful behaviors. Thetest cases are generated dynamically based on the behaviors in the taxonomy. Since these datasets and taxonomies already cover a wide range of safety-related behaviors, we mainlysought to merge and augment them in our work. However, they do not focus on refusals related toinstructions a model cannot comply with that are not safety-related. We refer to such refusals ascannot-related. Although less research exists on this topic, some papers have explored tasks thatare inherently impossible to complete due to uncertainty, model limitations, modality constraints, orother factors.",
  "Existing cannot-related taxonomies": "Jiang et al. show that models tend to perform poorly on questions that are unanswerable, alsofinding that prediction confidence in early transformer-based language models was not a reliableindicator of the models uncertainty. Agarwal et al. create a dataset of five types (Incomplete,Future, Incorrect, Ambiguous, and Unmeasurable) of unanswerable questions and also find thatSOTA LLMs underperform the human baseline on this task. Liu et al. create a similardataset of unanswerable or unknown questions (UnknownBench), and reach a comparable conclusion,additionally confirming previous findings showing that model prediction confidence is not a reliableindicator of model uncertainty. Xiong et al. find that LLMs tend to be overconfident whenasked to express their own uncertainty, highlighting the need for more research on this topic. Denget al. explore methods to perform synthetic data augmentation to improve model performanceon such questions, showing promising results. Zhang et al. [2024a] attempt to construct a refusal-aware dataset by identifying gaps between the models training corpus and knowledge encodedin model parameters, showing that augmentation of the dataset with refusal instances of this kindimproves model performance on such tasks, and that ability to refuse is a meta-skill that can generalizeto other tasks.",
  "Contributions": "We present a unified taxonomy of 16 refusal categories, a dataset of 8,600 real instances annotatedby a single annotator, 500 refusals annotated by four independent annotators for each instance, over100,000 synthetic refusals, and linguistic mutations resulting in over 7 million synthetic refusals. Wealso release classifiers for these datasets to automatically audit refusal behaviors of models and adjustIFT and RLHF datasets to improve the safety and reliability of LLMs.",
  "Refusals": "A refusal occurs when the output O indicates that a refusal to comply with the instruction supplied inthe input I did occur. We define the refusal identification function r as:r : (S, I, O) {0, 1},(2)where r(S, I, O) = 1 if O is a refusal, and 0 otherwise. We also define the estimated refusalidentification function r as:r : (S, I) {0, 1},(3) which predicts whether a refusal should occur based only on the system prompt S and input I, withoutaccess to the output O, as opposed to whether it actually occurred in the output O. This function is,for example, implicitly learned during post-training. Although the datasets published in this workcould be used as a starting point to train a classifier that learns this function, this modified problemimplicitly necessitates the use of judgment over which requests should and should not be refused.Such judgments often involve complex ethical considerations and can vary based on cultural, legal,and personal perspectives. Although this is an important aspect of refusal behavior in AI systems, itis beyond the scope of our current work. In this paper, we focus primarily on the technical aspects ofidentifying and classifying refusals, rather than making normative judgments about which refusalsare appropriate or necessary.",
  "Data Collection": "We employed an iterative approach to collect a diverse set of refusal instances. Initially, we collect aset of refusals from publicly available IFT and RM datasets by searching through a small subset ofthe data both manually and using an LLM. We then iteratively gather new refusals by embeddingall instances in the dataset, identifying the embeddings of the seed refusals, and searching for newrefusals with high similarity scores to a representative vector of the seed refusals, such as the mean orweighted mean of their embeddings. We subsequently sample the top n candidates and verify themusing an LLM to ensure their quality, adding them to the refusal dataset if they pass the verificationstep. We repeat this process for a fixed number of iterations.",
  "Taxonomy Development": "We developed a comprehensive taxonomy tree of refusal behaviors through an extensive literaturereview of existing work on LLM refusals and safety behaviors, combined with a bottom-up analysisof the refusal instances in our collected dataset R. This dual approach allowed us to capture boththeoretical categorizations from prior research and empirically observed refusal patterns. Through review of refusals found in public datasets and the existing literature, we identified twofundamental categories of refusals: Should not-related and Cannot-related. We then performed abottom-up analysis of the refusals in R combined with the categories defined in previous works listedin 1 to identify additional categories that better capture the nuances of refusal behavior and arrived atthe taxonomy tree shown in .",
  "Should not-related refusals": "Chain of CommandCovers refusals of the model not being able to carry out the instruction inthe input I because the developer specified a system prompt S that prohibitsthe model from carrying out the instruction. This is a refusal category whichwas introduced recently through the addition of system messages, which areunavailable in most public datasets, so the amount of refusals we could collectfor this category is limited. Legal ComplianceIncludes refusals that are due to the model not being able to carry out theinstruction in the input I because it would be illegal to do so. As intellectualproperty rights violations are an increasingly important area of concern in AIsafety, we also included the subcategory Intellectual Property Rights as a top-level category. In theory, for every jurisdiction, this category should containall applicable laws and regulations that the model must comply with in thatjurisdiction. Information Haz-ardsWe use Bostroms definition of information hazards [Bostrom, 2011] as a guidefor what constitutes an information hazard in this category of refusals, groupedby the information transfer mode: data hazards, idea hazards, attention hazards,template hazards, signaling hazards, and evocation hazards. PrivacyConsists of refusals where the instruction would involve revealing or compro-mising someones personal information, regardless of whether doing so wouldbe legal. This includes requests for personal details, private communications, orsensitive data about individuals or organizations. While some privacy-relatedrequests may be legal (such as searching publicly available records), the modelmay still refuse if fulfilling the request could enable stalking, harassment, orother privacy violations. NSFWIncludes refusals that are due to the model not being able to carry out theinstruction in the input I because the output would be considered not safe forwork (NSFW), such as requests for explicit content or adult content, racist orviolent content, or other content that is considered inappropriate or offensive.",
  "Cannot-related refusals": "ModalitiesIncludes refusals that are due to the model not being able to carry out theinstruction in the input I because it does not have the necessary modalities to doso. For instance, the model may refuse to generate an image because it does nothave the necessary capabilities, or it may refuse to call a particular API becausethe API is not supported by the model. Generally, this category can be thoughtof as dealing with IO limitations of the model, encompassing all the channelsthrough which the model can interact with the external world. SkillsCovers refusals that are due to the model not being able to carry out the instruc-tion in the input I because it does not have the necessary skill or ability to do so.For instance, the model may refuse to calculate some complex mathematicalexpression (instead of hallucinating an answer) because it knows it does nothave the necessary mathematical capabilities to successfully complete the task. Invalid PremiseIncludes all refusals that are due to the instruction in the input I being syntacti-cally or semantically incorrect. For instance, the model may refuse to answer aquestion that is inherently contradictory or illogical, completely malformed andincoherent, or otherwise not a valid instruction. Missing Informa-tionThis area encompasses four different types of refusals: Knowledge Cutoff: Refusals that are due to the model not being able to carryout the instruction in the input I at time t because the pre-training corpuswas collected at some time ttrain < t. For instance, the model may refuseto answer a question about a recent political event because the pre-trainingcorpus was collected months or years before the event. Unknown Information: Refusals that are due to the model not being ableto carry out the instruction in the input I because the answer is generallyunknown. For instance, this includes information about events at some pointt > t, whether a particular event will or will not occur in the future or whethersome mathematical conjecture is true or false. Training Data Limits: Queries involving information that could have beenknown to the model at the time of training ttrain < t but was not present inthe training data. For instance, this might include some obscure historicalfact that could be researched in a national archive but was not included in thetraining data. Missing Context: The instruction I is syntactically and semantically correct,but the model does not have enough information to carry out the instruction.For instance, the user might instruct the model to fix an error in a programwithout providing the code to fix.",
  "Mutual Exclusivity and Exhaustiveness": "During taxonomy development, it became evident that it is impossible to define a set of exhaustiveand mutually exclusive categories and still adhere to an intuitive notion of distinct reasons for requestrejection. This is because one can always construct mixed refusal instructions that belong to multiplecategories. Take the following two categories: NSFW and Modalities. These categories clearly and intuitivelydefine distinct reasons for request rejection: One signifies that the output would not adhere to somecontent policy, while the other signifies that the model is unable to generate the requested output dueto its architecture. However, what if the user asks for a graphic image, the model has to refuse due tothe output both being NSFW and due to its inability to generate images. This is also the case for Cannot- and Should Not-related categories. Consider the request \"calculate to 1030 digits and output a video where each frame shows one of the digits\". These clearly correspondto intuitively distinct limitations of the model, yet the refusal belongs to both the Modalities andSkills categories. More generally, for any set of refusal categories, it is almost always possible to construct a mixedrefusal which belongs to all categories, no matter which categorization is chosen. We thereforeabandoned the goal of defining a mutually exclusive set of categories and instead define a taxonomythat aims to be exhaustive, but not mutually exclusive.",
  "v1 represents the categorization defined in Appendix 15 vi for i 2 represents increasingly granular refusal scenarios, capturing more detailedaspects of LLM refusal behavior": "Each path Pl thus encodes a complete classification of a specific type of refusal behavior, allowing forfine-grained categorization while maintaining hierarchical relationships between related refusal types.The taxonomy is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new nodes as novel refusalpatterns emerge. It can also be easily altered, e.g. by substituting the Legal Compliance categorybased on the applicable jurisdiction and training an adapter [Houlsby et al., 2019] based on examplesfrom the altered taxonomy.",
  "Human Annotation": "For evaluation and classifier training using this dataset, as well as for synthetic data generation, wefilter out some instances of refusals collected in this dataset. We remove instructions that are notrefusals because binary classification of refusals has already been addressed in previous works. Wealso remove the \"Unclear\" labels used during the labeling process, since it does not signify a category,and \"[Should Not Do] Chain of Command\" because most public instruction fine-tuning datasets donot contain system messages and the category does not yield itself to synthetic data generation as anypossible instruction could be specified, making it not well-constrained enough.",
  "Multiple Human Annotators": "To assess inter-annotator agreement and capture the nuances in refusal categorization, we selecta representative subset of refusals from those classified by single human annotators to undergoa multi-labeling process where multiple annotators independently classify the same instructions,without knowledge of the other annotators classifications or LLM suggestions. This allows us toassess inter-annotator agreement and later evaluate the agreement of our refusal classifier with humanjudgments. To select a diverse subset of refusals, we embed all refusals in R and subsequentlyperform dimensionality reduction using UMAP [McInnes et al., 2020]. We then select a subset ofthe refusals that are well-separated in the reduced embedding space by overlaying a 2D grid overthe feature space and sampling from each cell. We continue picking samples for each categoryuntil we obtain an even distribution of categories. All labels previously obtained are then discarded.This subset of instances is then annotated by multiple human annotators to assess inter-annotatoragreement. In total, 4 annotators labeled 500 instructions, resulting in the dataset Dmultihuman.",
  "Synthetic Dataset Generation": "To improve the generalization of our classifier and reduce dataset bias, we create a synthetic datasetDS for each leaf node l L containing examples that correspond to the specific refusal patternrepresented by the path Pl from root to leaf. We first generate a set of synthetic input examples ISthat correspond to the refusal pattern in Pl. We then generate a set of synthetic output examples OSthat correspond to the same refusal pattern in Pl.",
  "VariationDescription": "ParaphraseRephrase the refusal message while maintaining the original meaning. This teststhe models ability to recognize different phrasings of refusals.Soft RefusalAdjust the response to be less direct, gently declining the request without overtlysaying \"no\" and providing an alternative.ShortenProvide a brief refusal, possibly omitting detailed explanations while still con-veying the refusal reason.ExpandExpand the response with more details, thoroughly explaining the exact reasonfor the refusal.More EmpatheticIncorporate empathetic language to show understanding and concern for theusers request or feelings. Finally, we merge all variations of both inputs IS and outputs OS to obtain a synthetic datasetDS for each leaf node l L, which is balanced across categories and sufficiently large to train ahigh-performing classifier.",

  "The first human-labeled dataset Dsinglehuman consists of 8,650 input-output pairs labeled by humanannotators. Each sample was annotated once by one of eight annotators. Reviewers could assign": "multiple labels per refusal instance, however the distribution is highly skewed towards one labelper instance, with 72.4% of instances having a single label, 25.5% having two labels, 1.9% havingthree labels and only 0.1% having four labels. The mean system instruction length is 61.4 characters( = 135.6), the mean input length is 712.6 characters ( = 1538.4), and the mean output length is376.6 characters ( = 490.5). The second human-labeled dataset is a subset of the first and contains 501 input-output pairs, eachlabeled independently by four annotators, where the same four annotators annotated each example.This enables us to conduct more sophisticated analyses of our taxonomy, such as an evaluation ofinter-annotator agreement and insights into subjective differences in interpreting refusal behavior. Although the instances selected from Dsinglehuman for quadruple labeling were chosen to be balancedacross classes and sufficiently diverse, the frequency of each label is highly skewed towards morecommon categories. This is likely due to the fact that some categories were not well represented inopen-source datasets, and thus a larger fraction of the labels considered when choosing the subsetDmultihuman for these uncommon categories was noisy for such categories. Details about our human-annotated datasets are summarized in table 4 and the composition of Dsinglehuman and Dmultihuman arevisualized in figure 1 and 2. The sources of the datasets we collected refusal instances from are listedin table 5.",
  "Synthetic Datasets": "The two synthetic datasets provide larger volumes and higher diversity in refusal data. We firstcreated one dataset of synthetic input prompts.

As explained in the methodology section, we reduced the number of categories from16 to 13. The D100Ksynth dataset includes 8,000 input-output pairs for each of the 13 categories, resultingin 104,000 samples. To enhance linguistic and contextual diversity, a varied version of the datasetD100Ksynth, Dultrasynth was also created. Details about the 14 input and 5 output variations are summarizedin table 2 and 3. By combining these variations, excluding one infeasible combination (shortenedinput with expanded output), the dataset contains 7.17 million samples. These details are summarizedin table 6.",
  ": Correlation (Krippendorffs Alpha) between human annotators": "Krippendorffs Alpha between humans and the majority vote for each instruction was 0.590, 0.546,0.497 and 0.608. Generalized Cohens Kappa provided similar scores of 0.590, 0.547, 0.499 and0.609. Intersection ratio between each reviewer and other reviewers was 0.635, 0.593, 0.549 and0.651. These scores indicate moderate agreement between annotators, which is likely due to alack of quality data on refusal instances, as some instances found in the real world are hard todecipher and categorize. This can also be explained by the fact that there are many instances incommon IFT and RLHF datasets where the model does not provide any explicit refusal reason,making it hard to classify such cases beyond binary labels, as the refusal reason must be inferredexplicitly from the input I, which is more ambiguous. The data selection process, aimed to testthe limits of our categorization, also specifically prioritized data points that occurred outside ofcommon clusters, which likely increased the ambiguity of classifications in Dmultihuman as compared toa randomly selected subset, since the dataset contained several clusters of very similar data pointsfor which the categories were less ambiguous. In addition to that, many of the datasets examinedcontained data with substantial quality deficiencies, including inconsistencies, errors, and a lack ofsemantic integrity, which undermine their reliability and utility for analysis and interpretation. We next examine how strong the consensus is among labelers that any particular instance should beassigned a particular category. In we see that in more than 70% of cases, the maximum labelwas picked by three or four out of four annotators. However, there also seems to be a significant",
  ": Distribution of maximum consensus scores in Dmultihuman. Maximum consensus describeshow large the majority vote was for any given refusal instance": "amount of cases where there was no agreement at all. The reasons for this are most likely the same asfor the moderate agreement rate above. Most data points where opinions diverged entirely are due toinsufficient quality in model responses, as well as no clear explanation for the refusal reason in themodel response, which increases classification ambiguity. The count of distinct labels for each category in gives insights into how often categoriesco-occur, while also providing insights into instances that are hard to classify under our taxonomy. In27% of cases, there was unanimous agreement on one category of refusal among all of the annotators,while in 10.2% of cases, annotators chose four or more distinct categories.",
  ": Distribution of distinct label amounts for the Dmultihuman dataset. Unique labels describe themagnitude of the set of labels assigned to a particular refusal instance": "It is important to note that the labels on such instances might not necessarily be wrong, as ourtaxonomy is not mutually exclusive but rather views each refusal as falling under a combination ofcategories which are more or less pronounced. Examples of four or more distinct labels also includedmany cases where the model did not explain its precise reason for refusal in detail, instead giving avague response which led to ambiguity during the classification process. They also included instanceswhere the refusal would fall into two or three categories of our taxonomy, which half or more of thereviewers did agree, while some also assigned other categories which could not entirely be ruled outdue to response ambiguity, or were assigned simply due to labeling errors. It is also worth notingthat this distribution does not represent the distribution of distinct label counts for actual real-worlddatasets, which is because, as previously stated, we aimed to obtain a sufficiently diverse sample totest the limits of our classification for rare cases of refusals. The selection process employed is biasedtowards outliers, disregarding samples which are very close to other samples in the embedding space.It is likely that the proportion of ambiguous cases in real-world datasets would differ significantly.An indication of that is the label distribution in Dsinglehuman, where 72.4% of instances were marked asbeing correct by reviewers while having only a single label attached, although this skew could also be influenced by the pre-labeling process we employed for Dsinglehuman, which assigned one preliminarycategory to each label. Detailed unbiased examination of compositions of IFT and RLHF datasetswould require a manual labeling of a substantial random subset by many annotators, which wasdeemed infeasible.",
  ": Average share of the majority label for all labels and each category. Should not-relatedcategories are red, cannot-related are blue": "In we plot the share of the majority label for each category. This gives us the averagepercentage of the label among all labels whenever a label for that category constituted the majority,and thus gives us a notion of how likely labels in one particular category are to co-occur with labelsin other categories. We see that some categories such as \"NSFW Content\", \"Missing Identity\",\"Missing Context\" and \"Knowledge Cutoff\" are unlikely to co-occur with other labels, while forother categories such as \"Information Hazards\" and \"Invalid Premise\" are more likely to also haveother labels assigned to them. This primarily reflects on the composition of Dmultihuman, which islikely not representative of IFT and RLHF datasets generally, but could also give general hints onhow well-separated commonly occurring instances of refusals in the real world are depending ontheir category. For some classes such as \"Intellectual Property Rights\" this is plausible, since itis a subcategory of \"Legal Compliance\". \"Information Hazards\" appears to be a category oftenco-occurring with others because of the broad definition of what constitutes an \"Information Hazard\".Many instances of queries which would constitute an \"Information Hazard\" are likely to also fallinto other categories, at least from what we have observed in refusals found in public datasets. Forexample, we frequently observed requests to produce content of racist or sexist nature, which wouldfall under \"NSFW\" under our categorization. However, because the model argued that this might alsocause psychological harm, annotators frequently co-assigned the \"Information Hazards\" label to suchinstances. Because there were also many cases of \"NSFW\" refusals which occurred alone, this is notreflected as much in the share of majority labels in the \"NSFW\" category. Other categories such as\"Training Data Limits\" are often confused with other categories of the \"Missing Information\" branchof our categorization, for example with \"Knowledge Cutoff\". The separation between these categoriescan sometimes be ambiguous, because it requires knowledge about whether a piece of informationcould have been present in the training data or whether it would have to be provided as context. Forexample, a very specific serial number of a technology product could have been present in the trainingdata, so not knowing it would be a \"Training Data Limits\" refusal by default. In contrast, informationabout the schedule or private personal information of a specific user is almost certainly not present inthe training data. Since pretraining datasets are mostly not public and hard to search, separating thesetwo categories often involves judgment and can result in ambiguity in certain cases. For certain usecases, one might consider merging the \"Missing Information\" nodes into one.",
  ": Majority vs minority category annotation distribution (normalized and absolute counts)": "In we see the normalized distribution of majority and minority category label counts. Thisplot shows the relative and absolute distribution of human annotated labels (category IDs) with regardsof the majority agreement label. The highest score in each row resembles the label which received maximum agreement, while every other element in a row accumulates all the labels (minority labels)that have been given next to the max agreement label (majority label) for a particular instance. Thisvisualizes the common ambiguities human annotators have when annotating the dataset. We observethat labels with high co-assignment rates have very low absolute label counts. For these categories, wedid not observe many instances in the refusals we found publicly that would commonly be assigned tothat category. For example, there were no \"CBRN\" (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear)related prompts in the refusals we collected from public datasets.",
  ": Distribution of \"at-least-one\" accuracy percentages for different models. An accurateclassification is defined as one where the model agrees with one or more human annotators": "We next examine the classification accuracy of various LLMs (). For this, we analyze variousmetrics, such as \"at-least-one agreement\" and \"majority agreement\". When evaluating LLMs, weoriginally experimented with giving each model the ability to name multiple categories. However,when given the choice to assign many labels per category, we observed that models would eitherconfidently assign just only one single category, or, in rare cases, name a lot more categories than oneor two, which did not make much sense. We also observed that different LLMs were generally moreor less likely to provide a list of categories when asked to do so. Thus, we changed the evaluationprocess of LLMs to allow them to predict only a single category, with the intention of getting moresignal from such predictions. For \"at-least-one agreement\", we observe that models with generallyhigher capabilities also tend to perform better on the task of refusal classification. Unfortunately,because learnable parameter counts for many of the models are not publicized, we are not able toconduct an exhaustive correlation analysis between them and accuracy in refusal classification. Wedid, however, observe some fluctuations in model ability to follow our classification instructions,which consisted of a general description of the categories and one few-shot example per category.For instance, \"Llama 3.1 70B\" consistently underperformed compared to other models of similar size,such as \"Qwen 2 72B\", which performed surprisingly well for their parameter count. Agreementwith the majority of human labelers for each model was 51.10% for GPT-4o, 49.90% for Gemini 1.5Pro, 52.10% for Mistral Large, 47.31% for Qwen 2.5 72B, 38.92% for Llama 3.1 405B, 45.51% forGPT-4o-mini, 34.73% for Command R+, 26.95% for Llama 3.1 70B, and 35.00% for Llama 3.1 8B.For reference, expected agreement by chance would be 6.25%.",
  ": Correlations between classifications of different LLMs ()": "examines how much models agree pair-wise, measured though Krippendorffs Alpha.We observe that generally, models which perform better on refusal classification tend to correlatemore strongly with other models also performing well on the task. However, there are some notableexceptions, such as the strong correlation observed between \"GPT-4o\" and \"GPT-4o-mini\", whichis likely because these models were trained on similar datasets and thus have similar biases whenassigning categories. Again, we observe that some models are able to significantly outperform peersof similar sizes, with \"Qwen 2.5 72B\" being the most notable example.",
  "Classifier Evaluation": "We evaluated the classifiers trained on synthetic data on a subset of the human annotations from ourmulti-reviewer dataset Dmultihuman which were labeled by four labelers. For accuracy, we measuredboth \"at-least-one agreement\" and \"majority agreement\". Both of the classifiers predict a probabilitydistribution p over classes, however, since they were trained on synthetic data which has only onecorrect label per category, the distributions are often skewed towards 100% confidence for one classand close to zero confidence on other classes. Additionally, in order to facilitate a fair comparisonwith language models, which we evaluated by predicting one single category for each class due toaforementioned reasons, we chose argmax(p) as the single predicted class for a particular instanceduring evaluation. For the BERT classifier, we observe an \"at-least-one\"-agreement of 51.57% and a majority agreementof 37.00%, which indicates moderate performance with significant room for improvement. Expectedmajority agreement by chance would be 7.7%, which shows the model is performing substantiallybetter than random guessing. In we see the common confusions between the BERTclassifier and the ground truth, the human labels. Some confusions are similar to the ones observedby human annotators, giving hints at semantic overlap between categories frequently observed in our",
  ": BERT Classifier Heatmap of confused classifications": "evaluation dataset Dmultihuman. For instance, \"Legal Compliance\" is often confused with \"IntellectualProperty Rights\" and \"Information Hazards\". Some classes, such as \"Training Data Limits\" havecomparatively very low confusion, however since the accuracies on other labels are much lower, itindicates the model overpredicts this category and more diverse data is likely needed to learn the truedistinction between these categories, as data in the training set from this category likely possessesvery generic features, which induces a bias in the model towards it. Some categories for whichtotal label counts were low also experienced very high confusion, with almost no labels assignedcorrectly, indicating the need to find instances more representative of the overall category, such as\"CBRN\"-related threats for \"Information Hazards\". The moderate performance of the classifier indicates that the model has likely not learned thedefining features during pretraining that would help the classification head draw a distinction betweendifferent categories of refusals, which in turn makes it more difficult to learn a classification headon top of it that captures this deep semantic interpretation. We experimented with a broad range ofhyperparameter configurations, however we were not able to achieve performance comparable toSOTA LLMs with this architecture.",
  ": Logistic Classifier Heatmap": "We now analyze the performance of the logistic regression classifier (), which was trainedon the outputs of NV-Embed-V2, a SOTA text embedding model. The classifier has \"at-least-one\"-agreement of 78.08% and agrees with the majority of human annotators 52.47% of the time,indicating a significant improvement compared to the BERT-based classifier. There is a much strongercorrelation between the true and predicted labels on the diagonal. Some categories, such as \"MissingIdentity\" or \"Missing Context\" now have much higher normalized counts than before, indicatingthat the classifier is now able to identify instances of these classes much better compared to before.However, other classes such as \"Information Hazards\" now have lower normalized counts, withfrequent confusions between it and \"Legal Compliance\" and \"NSFW\". This points towards the factthat the examples in our dataset Dmultihuman for this category are not clearly semantically separated fromother categories. The gap between the performance of the BERT-based and logistic regression classifier points towardsthe conclusion that refusal classification is a task performance on which improves with increasinglygeneral models, since the NV-Embed-V2 model used has significantly more parameters than theBERT model. This is also corroborated by the fact that larger language models with more generalcapabilities as measured by common benchmarks approximate human classifications significantlybetter than smaller models. There still is significant semantic overlap or co-occurrence for some pairsof categories, evidenced both by common human classification confusions and classifier confusions.For example, \"Missing Context\" has significant confusion with \"Training Data Limits\" and \"MissingIdentity\". Semantic overlap as an explanation for the confusion of these categories seems plausible,since information not present in the training data could have been present in the context of the model,making it hard to determine the exact category for an instance.",
  ": Correlation (Krippendorffs ) between majority vote of all other reviewers with eachreviewer, and the majority vote of all reviewers with the logistic classifier and various LLMs": "We observe that when measuring the correlation between the majority of all other humans and eachindividual human, correlation scores are higher than when measuring the correlation between humansand LLMs, except for Reviewer 3, which had only slightly higher correlation with other humanscompared to SOTA LLMs. There appears to be higher consensus among humans compared to modelsto the majority vote of humans, which indicates that assuming the majority correctly classified mostof the instructions, there is still a significant gap in refusal reason understanding between humans andSOTA LLMs. We iterated on the prompts used to achieve these results several times and selected thebest-performing prompt. However, it is likely that these classification errors could be further reducedby employing more sophisticated methods, such as chain-of-thought reasoning on refusals, to achievebetter approximations. We could not assess the performance of newer model architectures, suchas OpenAI o1, because attempts to classify refusals with these models frequently ended in refusalthemselves.",
  "Cost Comparison": "Our logistic classifier is based on a 7 billion parameter embedding model, which has a throughputof about 10,000 refusal instances per minute when run on an H100. Our classifier only has a fewthousand parameters on top of the embedding weights, so the inference speed is bottlenecked by thethroughput of the embedding model. Assuming the current market price of about 3$/hour for anNVIDIA H100, the cost per 1000 classifications is about 0.005$, compared to about 10$ for OpenAIsGPT-4o, assuming a total prompt length of 4000 tokens with few-shot examples of the categorizationand the (S, I, O) instance. shows that our logistic classifier is several orders of magnitude cheaper than current SOTALLMs, while achieving similar agreement scores with humans. Thus, our classifier enables theanalysis of refusal compositions for IFT and RLHF datasets at a very large scale, while achievingslightly better agreement with the majority of humans compared to the most capable LLMs (52.47%vs. 52.10% for \"Mistral-Large\", the best-performing LLM). It also has significantly higher throughputgiven the same computational resources, and therefore increases the feasibility of detailed datasetrefusal composition analysis.",
  "Discussion": "This work presents a possible framework for classifying cases of refusal behavior of large languagemodels. We develop a taxonomy of 16 refusal categories and a more detailed taxonomy of 992specific refusal scenarios. We collect a dataset of refusals annotated by human annotators and generatea synthetic refusal dataset based on our taxonomy. We subsequently train classifiers to learn therefusal identification function r and evaluate their performance on a human-labeled multi-annotatordataset Dmultihuman. Our taxonomy captures two broad types of refusal behaviors which have previously been viewedseparately: cannot-related and should not-related. We believe these refusal classes capture the wholescope of LLM refusal behaviors and offer a unified perspective on the topic of LLM refusals. Ourexperiment of performing independent human annotation on a sample of 500 diverse instructionsshows moderate agreement, with annotator-majority correlation of up to 0.62, tending towardsagreement of 0.67, which would be considered sufficient. Our classifier trained on synthetic datashows classification performance similar to common SOTA LLMs while being several orders ofmagnitude cheaper to run. The lack of agreement among annotators might be caused by the selection of the dataset Dmultihuman,which was optimized for diversity instead of representativeness, the overall poor quality of publiclyavailable instruction fine-tuning data, and inherent semantic overlap between some categories of ourtaxonomy. The challenges related to data are exacerbated by the fact that some public IFT and RLHFdatasets specifically filter out refusals, aiming to create models that do not refuse as a differentiationto proprietary models, which currently exceed the capabilities of publicly available models but haveundergone safety alignment. Due to the time intensity of manual labeling, lack of human annotators and sufficient quantities ofdiverse real-world data, the human-annotated datasets are likely too small to train a robust generalizingclassifier on real-world data. We resolved this by generating synthetic datasets which we constructedto be more balanced and sufficiently diverse, while still capturing the essence of our taxonomy. Theclassifiers trained on synthetic data show significant agreement with humans, comparable to currentSOTA LLMs, which indicates our approach towards generating synthetic data has been broadlysuccessful. It is likely that once the data scarcity issue for real-world refusal instances is resolved, onecould train a more performant classifier, as the data distribution would more accurately approximatereal-world data. Although our taxonomy permits multiple categories per label, it is likely that there was a strong biasamong annotators towards assigning a single label during the human annotation process. This couldbe due to the incentive structure in the labeling process, which only counted the total number ofcompleted annotations and not the number of total labels across all samples. Likewise, our syntheticdataset only contains instances which have a single label per instance, instead of multiple labelswhich would likely apply, making our classifiers not well suited for accurately predicting the wholerange of refusal categories for a given instance. Our approach for generating synthetic data aimed to enumerate an exhaustive set of refusal behaviors,with several diverse examples per subcategory. Nevertheless, there are almost certainly subcategorieswhich were not included, representing potential coverage gaps of our synthetic dataset compared toreal-world data. In addition, despite the linguistic mutations we included in Dultrasynth, the dataset doesnot capture the broad scope of linguistic mutations observed in the real world, which LLMs havetrouble generating as they have a strong bias towards generating grammatically correct and otherwisesound sentences and punctuation, which contrast with typical human inputs. Our synthetic datasetsare also limited to English, and the real-world datasets are also mostly in English. We did not address the issue of LLM jailbreaks in our datasets, as we discovered comparatively fewinstances of them in the datasets we examined. Jailbreaks could potentially be seen as a separatenode (\"Safety Alignment Circumvention\") of our taxonomy under the should not branch of refusals. Itcould also be argued that LLM jailbreaks represent a general failure in instruction following, and theissue arises when jailbreaks are then used to carry out activities which fall under one of our categories,such as \"Illegal Activities\" or \"Information Hazards\". They could be seen as falling under the \"Chainof Command\" category, as they represent failures of the model to adhere to developer instructions,allowing conflicting user instructions to be executed instead. However, since we only examinedrefusals as indicated by the output O, instead of analyzing instructions that should have been refusedbut were not, our work does not address this critical safety issue. It is, however, addressed in otherworks. Shen et al. , Chu et al.",
  "We also did not address refusals that fail to fulfill the query without explicitly declining the request,as we view this as a failure mode of the model and not a refusal, similarly to Rttger et al.": "During annotation, we experimented with a confidence score for each label to quantify certainty,but found that, consistent with prior research, LLMs which were tasked with pre-classifying therefusals gave only high confidence scores, making the metric unreliable and not reflective of theactual confidence of the labels. Human annotators also rarely changed the default setting of 100,making the score less indicative of actual confidence. As a consequence, we ended up discarding theconfidence metric we collected. The lack of clear refusal explanations by models also represented a substantial challenge whenperforming annotation and classification. Often, models refuse with just a short sentence instead ofexplaining the reason for their refusal. This behavior is both intransparent to the user and also likelyimpedes the ability of the model to reason about refusals, which, as shown in prior research, improvesmodel performance.
