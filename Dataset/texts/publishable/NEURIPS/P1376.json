  "Abstract": "Stories are records of our experiences and their analysis reveals insights into thenature of being human. Successful analyses are often interdisciplinary, leveragingmathematical tools to extract structure from stories and insights from structure.Historically, these tools have been restricted to one dimensional charts and dynamicsocial networks; however, modern AI offers the possibility of identifying morefully the plot structure, character incentives, and, importantly, counterfactual plotlines that the story could have taken but did not take. In this work, we use AI tomodel the structure of stories as game-theoretic objects, amenable to quantitativeanalysis. This allows us to not only interrogate each characters decision making,but also possibly peer into the original authors conception of the characters world.We demonstrate our proposed technique on Shakespeares famous Romeo andJuliet. We conclude with a discussion of how our analysis could be replicated inbroader contexts, including real-life scenarios.",
  "Introduction": "Stories have long been one of humanitys most cherished methods for transmitting knowledge, takingshape in epic poems, religious texts, folktales, literature, and the oral traditions of cultures, families,and organizations. While stories are remarkably effective as a communication tool between humans,they were, until very recently, challenging for machine learning models to process due to their lack ofa clear structure that facilitates mathematical reasoning. There have been various attempts to extract from stories a mathematical structure, and then use thatto reason quantitatively about the story. Kurt Vonnegut proposed in his avant-garde (andoriginally rejected) masters thesis the notion of the shapes of a story. In his famous lecture, he says:",
  "I have tried to bring scientific thinking to literary criticism... Stories have very simple shapes, onesthat computers can understand": "Vonneguts attempt consisted in constructing one dimensional functions that represented the rise andfall of characters fortunes across a plot line and then classifying stories according to the shapes ofsuch functions. More sophisticated methods have later tried to represent the relationships betweenthe characters as a dynamic graph (see the survey by Labatut and Bost ) and used tools fromnetwork analysis to dissect stories according to the graphs they induce. Reagan et al. constructsshapes by analyzing how the overall sentiment varies across different windows of text within the",
  "arXiv:2412.05747v1 [cs.GT] 7 Dec 2024": "story. Toubia et al. again splits the story in different text windows and studies the geometryof the set of points obtained by the respective embeddings, obtaining notions of speed, volume andcircuitousness. Boyd et al. extracts a narrative structure by tracking the rate in which certaincategories of words appear along the story arc. In this paper we make a similar attempt to extract a mathematical structure, except that this timewe focus on the main decisions that the characters face, and the incentives and beliefs driving theiractions. To that end, we will represent stories as (extensive-form) games and then apply tools fromgame theory such as equilibrium computation to understand stories. Stories as Games:We will view stories as a sequence of decisions by different characters thataffect their ultimate fate. We get to learn what each character decided and how the events unfolded. Itis usually left to the reader to imagine what would have happened in the alternative scenarios (what ifRomeo and Juliet were to live happily together?). It is also left to the imagination of the reader whatwas the motivation of the characters to act how they did (how would Juliet feel if she married Parisinstead of Romeo?). Those are in fact closely related, as decisions can be seen as expressions of howcharacters would evaluate counterfactual scenarios. In this paper, we present a proof of concept on how to use large language models (LLMs) to reconstructthis hidden structure that encodes both the counterfactual scenarios as well as the incentives of thecharacters to act the way they did. We use LLMs to extract the main characters in a story, the maindecisions they face and their payoffs in alternative plot lines. Using those, we are able to representthem formally as an extensive-form game. The story itself will correspond to one of the sample pathsof the game tree. We will then use a game solver to compute an equilibrium of the induced game andrelate it to the story. We will say that a game rationalizes a story if the sample path correspondingto the actual story occurs with positive probability in equilibrium. This is of course a highly ambiguous task. Different readers will interpret Juliets motives differently.We view this as a feature, not a bug. In this preliminary version, we will demonstrate the steps toproduce one way of rationalizing a story. However, our methodology allows us to recover multiplegame trees that can rationalize the story in different ways. For the purposes of illustration we choose a story that is widely known (namely, Romeo and Juliet)where the decisions are taken by fictional characters. The methodology showcased here can beequally applied if instead of a literary text we had a business email and we are analyzing the decisionsfaced by the executive of an organization or a salesperson. Analyzing the Shape of Stories / Suspense and Surprise:Once a story is represented as a game,we can use the payoffs and the equilibrium probabilities to determine the expected fortune of eachcharacter along the story as well as the likelihood of the sampled path, and, in this way, identifyfeatures such as plot twists, suspenseful moments, etc. Moreover, this representation provides aprincipled way to obtain the fortune curve described by Vonnegut . In the game-theoretical representation, the fortune of each character at any given moment in timecan be represented very precisely by the expected payoffs under equilibrium starting from thatnode/info-set, which corresponds to what is called the value function in Reinforcement Learningand the cost-to-go in control theory. The evaluation of the value function along the tree can also beinterpreted as a martingale stochastic process. This perspective allows us to use the methodologyby Ely et al. to measure the interestingness of the story in terms of suspense and surprise, asmeasured in terms of statistical properties of the martingale and the realized sample. Thought Experiment:Our long-term vision is to be able to use LLMs to understand incentivesfaced by real agents and organizations. In a thought experiment, imagine we can process all the emailsof a business organization, identify the main decision-makers, the main decisions they need to make,and how they affect each other. Then we may be able to reconstruct which game they are playing andwhat their incentives are. This could be used to inform leaders about what the hidden incentives are,to advise specific decision-makers about how to play this game, or to design mechanisms to improveoutcomes for the organization. This is, of course, an ambitious, long-term goal. In this paper we take a first step by building amap from stories/text to formal games. Besides informing us about the interaction of decisions andincentives via game-theoretic analysis, such a map from stories to games has other applications as well: It provides a way to classify stories depending on their equilibrium structure (e.g., dependingon the answers to the questions: Do the characters have a dominant strategy? Does there exist a pureequilibrium or are they forced to randomize? Can their actions be rationalized?). It also allows us tostudy questions such as how certain game structures lead to more interesting stories. Roadmap:In this proof of concept, we use Romeo and Juliet to demonstrate our proposed AI-assisted technique of extracting structure, namely a game tree, and then deriving insights from agame-theoretic analysis. explains the process of building out a game tree by promptingGemini [Gemini Team, 2024]. then shows how to collate the information about our gametree and format it for input to a game theory reasoning engine, Gambit [Savani and Turocy, 2024]. then interprets the results of the game theory engines equilibrium computation. We discussthe rationality of the characters as well as conjecture Shakespeares model of Romeo and Julietsworld based on its consistency with game theorys concept of rationality. Finally, concludeswith a wider discussion of the implications of our proposed approach and avenues for future research.",
  "Game Trees and Nash Equilibrium": "We will formulate a story as a game in extensive form. We refer to the classical textbook of Fudenbergand Tirole for a detailed exposition. A game consists of a set of n players (here correspondingto the characters in the story) and is represented as a tree. The root of the tree corresponds to thebeginning of the story and each path corresponds to one possible way the story can unfold. Theleaf-nodes of the tree correspond to outcomes of the story and we will associate with each outcomea vector of payoffs which can be viewed as how happy each character is with this outcome. Theinternal nodes of the tree can be of two types: (i) a decision node which corresponds to a decision byone of the players; or (ii) chance node: which is a random decision by nature (capturing e.g., whethera secret message sent by one character will reach another character). In games, it is quite common that not all parties share the same information. For example, in poker, aplayer does not observe what cards have been dealt to the other players unless that information isrevealed in the course of the game. Because of this, as the play unravels from the root of the treetowards a leaf, it is possible that a player cannot distinguish (based on the information they haveobserved thus far) the true state of the game from several possible nodes based on the information theyhave observed so far. A set of nodes that would be indistinguishable to a player given the informationthat they have observed when any one of these nodes would be reached in the course of a play iscalled an information set of that player. Each player induces a partition of the nodes of the tree intoinformation sets. Obviously if an information set of some player contains a decision node for thatplayer, then all other nodes in that same information set are also decision nodes for that player andthe same actions are available at all decision nodes in the information set. A pure strategy of a player in an extensive-form game is a mapping from all information setscontaining decision nodes for that player to an action they would take if the play were to reach anyone node in that information set (as the player cannot distinguish among these nodes). A mixedstrategy of a player is a distribution over pure strategies. A behavioral strategy of a player is amapping from each information set containing decision nodes for that player to a distribution overthe actions that are available to the player at that information set. Once all players choose a strategy,a distribution over leaf nodes is induced, conditioning on the play reaching any particular node ofthe tree. We can thus compute expected payoffs for all players at each node. We say that a set ofstrategies are in Nash equilibrium if, given the strategies of the other players, no player can changetheir own strategy to improve their expected payoff at the root of the tree. In this work, we compute aspecific type of Nash equilibrium called a limiting logit equilibrium (LLE) that is unique in almost allgames [McKelvey and Palfrey, 1998, Turocy, 2005].",
  "Traversing the Game Tree and Exploring Counterfactuals with an LLM": "The first step in our proof of concept is to apply an LLM (in this case Gemini) to identify ina story who are the main characters, what are their decisions, and from there, uncover the plotstructure. As a first step we ask Gemini to identify the main characters and their decisions ( which produces the game path realized in the play.Next we use the language model to explore how the story could have unfolded if the characters had",
  "taken different decisions ( The model is askedabout what score characters would attribute to each of the outcomes (their game payoffs) as well asthe probabilities of certain events (chance nodes)": "In this proof of concept, there is still a great deal of human guidance in asking the right questions. Wetake steps to automate this process in . Below we include an excerpt focusing on the pointwhere Juliet decides to move forward with the plan to fake her death (hatched by Friar Lawrence). In Romeo and Juliet, Romeo is banished for avenging Mercutios death and killing Tybalt. Julietsfamily intends for her to marry Paris. Friar Lawrence has other ideas. Name options Juliet couldconsider including ones that her family might prefer, ones that may appear risky, and ones that mightappear tragic to the audience. Please only list three options.",
  "Geminis response:": "1. Obey her family and marry Paris (Familys preference): This is the most straightforward andsocially acceptable option. It would appease her family and maintain the peace between the Capuletsand Montagues. [...] 2.Fake her own death and reunite with Romeo (Risky): This is Friar Lawrences plan.Itinvolves Juliet taking a potion that will make her appear dead, allowing her to escape her family andeventually reunite with Romeo in Mantua. While this offers a glimmer of hope for a happy ending, itsincredibly risky. Theres a high chance of miscommunication or things going wrong [...]. 3.Take her own life (Tragic): Overwhelmed by the seemingly impossible situation and theprospect of marrying Paris, Juliet might consider suicide as a way to escape her predicament. Thiswould be the most tragic outcome for the audience [...]",
  "Probabilistic events like these are represented with chance nodes; nature rolls the dice and we observethe outcome": "Recall that Juliet is making her initial decision in the aftermath of the traumatic events includingdeaths of Mercutio, Tybalt, and the banishment of Romeo. We can model the mental impact of thistrauma as a probabilistic chance node determining whether Juliet is overwhelmed with grief: What is the probability that Juliet is initially overwhelmed with grief following the deaths of Mercutioand Tybalt as well as the banishment of Romeo? Assume if shes overwhelmed with grief, she wouldthen decide to take her own life. Please give a number between 0 and 100 for this probability.",
  "(G)": ": The game trees constructed with the assistance of Gemini for the final plot twists at the endof Romeo and Juliet. We consider both Game I rooted to the right of the purple boundary (the rednode (B) highlighted in green) and Game II rooted just left of it (the chance node (A) highlightedin yellow). The Nash equilibrium (specifically, limiting logit equilibrium) of Game II is denoted bythe yellow arrows at decision nodes; all strategies at each decision node are deterministic except forJuliets first decision which flips a fair coin when determining whether to marry Paris or fake her owndeath. For Game I, the equilibrium strategies are all deterministic and denoted by green arrows. Theloop encircling the three blue nodes indicates that these states (histories) appear exactly the same toRomeo; Romeo cannot differentiate between whether or not Juliet has actually died. decisions by Juliet, the blue nodes are decisions by Romeo and the dice nodes correspond to chance.The grey diamond boxes at the end of each path correspond to the agents payoffs, i.e., how happyor unhappy each character is with this particular way of the story unfolding. Notice the dotted looparound the three blue nodes in the diagram. The set of the three nodes is referred to as a singleinfostate, acknowledging that Romeo cannot discern between the distinct histories: has Juliet trulyended her life in grief, or has she merely faked her death without informing Romeo? This unknownis at the heart of Romeos decision. We examine two models: Game II considers the unpredictablepsychological effects of grief on Juliet, whereas Game I assumes perfect agency in actions for Juliet.",
  "In the simpler Game I, we find that the Nash equilibrium (specifically the limiting logit equilibrium)suggests Juliet should fake her death and Romeo choose to live despite his ignorance of her plan": "Contrast this with Game II where Romeo knows theres a chance that Juliet is overcome with griefand chooses to end her misery in death. The Nash equilibrium suggests that with 50% probability,Juliet elects to fake her death leading to Romeo tragically ending his life. But with equal probability,Juliet elects to marry Paris despite her love for Romeo. According to this game-theoretic model, theaudience observes just one possible sequence of events in the story of Romeo and Juliet.",
  "(c) Shape of Game II (Alt)": ": Shape of a Game: The design of the game tree can have a dramatic impact on the shape ofthe resulting story. (a) Game I has zero surprise (fluctuations in value function) and zero suspense(variance of value function) as it always results in a happy ending (I/J). (b) Adding a chance node anddecision node to Game I results in Game II and gives the story shape; the martingale of the Romeoand Juliet plot under Game II has both high surprise (large changes in both characters values afterJuliet is overcome with grief at the root node and when the message fails to reach Romeo) and highsuspense (high variance of the characters value functions at Juliets decision to fake her death as wellas natures choice of whether the message successfully reaches Romeo). (c) Contrast this with thelack of shape of the story given by the alternate ending where Juliet randomly selects to marry Paris.Shakespeare selects the most interesting story from the behaviors that are rationalizable.",
  "Discussion and Future Impact": "In this proof of concept, we used an LLM to analyze a play, distill its main elements into a game treeand produced two possible game trees (Game I and Game II) to represent the play. Only in Game IIare the decisions made by the characters in the actual play in the support of the equilibrium. For thatreason, we say that Game II rationalizes the story while Game I doesnt. Once we obtain a gametree that rationalizes the story, its equilibrium induces a value function on the nodes (). Thisallows us to plot how the expected fortune of the characters vary along the game path in the play.Such value function can be thought of as the expectation of a reader (who has the game tree in mind)who is still uncertain at that stage about which path will be taken. In the case of Romeo and Juliet,the value function follows the prototypical path of a tragedy: the fortunes of the characters initiallyrise, suggesting the possibility of a happy outcome, but ultimately fall precipitously. Our goal is to develop this proof of concept into a systematic approach that can be readily extendedto analyze other stories. This will allow us to obtain game representations for different narratives aswell as multiple interpretations of the same story. Analyzing various game theoretic interpretations ofa story can reveal different ways to rationalize it. To facilitate this extension, we can utilize few-shot prompting [Brown et al., 2020] with our Romeoand Juliet game tree example (, ) and chain of thought prompting [Wei et al., 2022]to guide the models reasoning about game structure and payoffs. This approach, with light humansupervision, has allowed us to generate multiple representations of Romeo and Juliet ( andextend to new stories like Hamlet ( Several important questions emerge from this work for future investigation. While we defined agame to rationalize a story when its equilibrium assigns positive probability to the actual storypath, evaluating game-theoretic representations requires a more comprehensive framework. Such aframework should consider the structural fidelity to key decision points, the ability to capture strategicinteractions between characters, and the validity of assigned payoffs and chance probabilities. More fundamentally, we acknowledge that game-theoretic representations have inherent limitationsin capturing narrative complexity. Elements like character development, emotions, and themes maynot readily fit within game trees formal structure. These boundaries suggest promising directions fordeveloping approaches that complement game-theoretic analysis with other computational methods,potentially offering new insights at the intersection of formal modeling and literary analysis.",
