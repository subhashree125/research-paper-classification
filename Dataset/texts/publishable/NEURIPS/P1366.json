  "Abstract": "Content Warning: This paper may contain examples of harmful contents by nature.In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring safety is acrucial and widely discussed topic. However, existing works often overlook the geo-diversity of cultural and legal standards across the world. To demonstrate the chal-lenges posed by geo-diverse safety standards, we introduce SAFEWORLD, a novelbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs ability to generate responsesthat are not only helpful but also culturally sensitive and legally compliant acrossdiverse global contexts. SAFEWORLD encompasses 2,342 test user queries, eachgrounded in high-quality, human-verified cultural norms and legal policies from50 countries and 493 regions/races. On top of it, we propose a multi-dimensionalautomatic safety evaluation framework that assesses the contextual appropriate-ness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of responses. Our evaluations reveal thatcurrent LLMs struggle to meet these criteria. To enhance LLMs alignment withgeo-diverse safety standards, we synthesize helpful preference pairs for Direct Pref-erence Optimization (DPO) alignment training. The preference pair constructionaims to encourage LLMs to behave appropriately and provide precise references torelevant cultural norms and policies when necessary. Our trained SAFEWORLDLMoutperforms all competing models, including GPT-4o on all the three evaluationdimensions by a large margin. Global human evaluators also note a nearly 20%higher winning rate in helpfulness and harmfulness evaluation. Our code and datacan be found here:",
  "Introduction": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as LLaMA and GPT , are becoming integral to variousAI applications, serving tens of millions of users globally. As their use increases, concerns aroundLLMs safety are rapidly growing. Recently, a wide range of studies focus on evaluating and reducingtheir toxic and harmful impact on users . Despite significantprogress in this area, an essential factor often remains overlooked: geo-diversity. Recognizing andincorporating geographical variations is crucial in the LLM global application.In particular, in terms of the landscape of LLM safety, cultural norms and legal frameworks varywidely, resulting in diverse definitions of safe and acceptable behavior. As shown in , whilegiving a green hat as a gift might be benign in many cultures, it is considered offensive in China.Likewise, legal ages for drinking and marriage differ significantly between regions. If a model fails toaccount for these cultural norms and local policies (i.e., cultural-legal guidelines), it can inadvertentlycause unnecessary conflicts among individuals or even between nations and pose significant legalrisks for local services. Therefore, to be both equitable and effective, LLMs must be calibrated toalign with diverse cultural norms and legal standards worldwide. We introduce SAFEWORLD, the first geo-diverse safety alignment evaluation benchmark, focusingon cultural and legal safety (3). SAFEWORLD evaluates an LLMs ability to generate helpful, safe,and appropriate responses in a global context. Constructed based on insights from our global usersurvey (Appendix A.2), SAFEWORLD comprises 2,342 high-quality diverse queries to simulaterealistic, geo-diverse safety scenarios, validated through machine and human validations, whichensures alignment with cultural-legal guidelines from 50 countries and 439 regions/races. To assess the quality of LLM responses to geo-diverse safety queries, we establish the three automaticevaluation protocols focusing on contextual appropriateness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness (4).Our evaluation reveals that LLaMA- and Mistral-series models can achieve comparable performanceto GPT-3.5 and GPT-4-turbo on several dimensions. Although the cultural-legal guidelines used toconstruct SAFEWORLD queries are all derived from GPT-4-turbos parametric knowledge, GPT-4-turbo still struggles with queries implicitly related to these guidelines and is even worse at providingappropriate response types than some open-source LLMs. This suggests that additional alignmentmethods may be necessary to effectively elicit and apply its learned knowledge in model responses. How can we design effective approaches for geo-diverse safety alignment? Focusing on the widelyused alignment method Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (5), we investigate how tosynthesize training data for preference pairs that helps LLMs behave appropriately and accuratelyelicit factual knowledge. Specifically, we first synthesize training queries based on our repositoryof human-verified cultural-legal guidelines, GEOSAFEDB. Positive responses are then synthesized toalign with the user queries and their corresponding cultural-legal guidelines. The negative responsesin preference pairs are divided into two categories: Negative Response Category 1, which includes re-sponses that correctly reference cultural-legal guidelines but do so inappropriately; Negative ResponseCategory 2, which includes responses that are behaviorally appropriate but contain incorrect refer-ences to cultural-legal guidelines. Following the DPO alignment practices suggested by HuggingfaceAlignment Handbook , trained on top of Zephyr-7B-SFT-Full , our SAFEWORLDLM modeloutperforms all competitors, including GPT-4o, across all three evaluated dimensions, along with anearly 20% higher winning rate in helpfulness and harmfulness assessments by human evaluators from9 countries. In addition, our SAFEWORLDALIGN training data proves to be useful for maintaining per-formance on general NLP and safety evaluation tasks while enhancing geo-diverse safety alignment. To summarize, we make the following contributions: (1) We introduce SAFEWORLD, the first geo-diverse safety alignment evaluation benchmark for future real-world global AI applications. (2) Wepropose a multi-dimensional safety evaluation framework to assess the contextual appropriateness,accuracy, and comprehensiveness of responses, crucial for geo-diverse safety alignment. (3) Wedevelop a geo-diverse safety alignment training method that enhances LLMs to outperform theadvanced GPT-4o model in generating precise geo-diverse safety knowledge.",
  ": The comparison between SAFEWORLD and other existing benchmarks": "resources like Wikipedia and Reddit, and categorizing them by countries or regions .However, these methods often yield noisy data due to challenges in filtering irrelevant informa-tion. CULTUREBANK improved data quality with a cleansing pipeline but did not address thesafety aspect of cultural awareness. Our study employs a bottom-up approach, starting with specificcountries and regions, followed by norm elicitation, careful data processing, and human validation.This approach ensures high-quality data collection cost-effectively. Additionally, our benchmarkincorporates public policies, broadening the applicability of SAFEWORLD to diverse use cases. LLM Safety Evaluation.Safety and ethical concerns about LLMs, including issues like toxicity,bias, and potential disclosure of personal information, have been explored . As LLMs usage grows, new safety evaluation benchmarks are being developed to helpresearchers better understand and address these issues. Benchmarks such as TOXICCHAT andSAFETYBENCH adopt a binary classification approach, requiring LLMs to determine whether aconversation is toxic, or use a multiple-choice format to prompt LLMs to choose the correct actionfrom a set of answers. Others, like SAFER-INSTRUCT , BEAVERTAILS and ANTHROPIC-HH evaluate open-ended generation results. However, these evaluations often overlook importantfactors: (1) the actual geo-diversity of safety standards, and (2) a fine-grained, multi-dimensionalassessment of aspects such as desired response behavior and the accuracy and factuality of referencesto pertinent norms and policies in the responses. SAFEWORLD represents the first geo-diversesafety alignment benchmark that provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLM responses across keydimensions, focusing on geo-diverse safety topics covering cultural norms and policies. Cultural-Awareness and Alignment in Language Models.Previous research has primarilyfocused on evaluating a language models preference when responding to global value surveys. Studies like formalize and quantitatively measure LLMsreflection of subjective opinions across nations. Another group of recent works simply query LLMswith the multiple-choice questions about multicultural knowledge . In contrast to theseevaluation works, our work investigates novel and more deterministic geo-diverse safety topics thattypically enjoy broader consensus among local populations or are documented in official records.Additionally, our work goes beyond examining simple multiple-choice multicultural QA, focusinginstead on assessing the safety and helpfulness of LLM responses in real-world open-ended generationsettings, and on exploring methods to further enhance response quality through alignment methods.",
  ": Overview of queries generation pipeline. Based on GEOSAFEDB, we generated four typesof queries. We apply both machine and human validation to ensure high-quality generation": "Cultural safety defines an environment that is spiritually, socially, emotionally, and physically safefor people . It is about adhering to cultural and social norms, which dictate appropriate scenariowithin a society. For example, in many East Asian countries, it is customary to remove ones shoesbefore entering a home, demonstrating respect for the household and ensuring cleanliness. Strayingfrom established norms can compromise both personal and communal harmony, highlighting theimportance of respecting cultural boundaries to ensure peaceful interactions within a society. Legal safety refers to abiding the policies enacted by governments, with each country havingits own set of regulations designed to maintain social order and stability. These rules establishstandards for acceptable scenario, resolve conflicts, and protect the rights and well-being of individualsand communities. Violating these policies can jeopardize public harmony in the local area,emphasizing the need to respect geo-diverse legal frameworks to preserve order.",
  "The Geo-Diverse Safety Alignment Task": "SAFEWORLD aims to evaluate models ability to respond appropriately, precisely, and helpfully toqueries involving a culturally or legally sensitive content. The input to this task is a query x that mayadhere to or violate specific cultural-legal guidelines ky = {ky1, ..., kyJ}, with an expected responsetype ry. These guidelines and response types vary by query type, detailed in 3.3.2.",
  "GEOSAFEDB Cultural-Legal Guideline Database Development": "The first step towards SAFEWORLD involves creating a cultural and legal geo-diverse safety database,referred to as GEOSAFEDB, composed of the cultural-legal guidelines of various geographic back-grounds. It is beneficial for generating the queries indeed grounded to geo-diverse safety-relatedtopics. We introduce a bottom-up approach, gathering country- and region/race-level guidelines viaLLM prompting, followed by validation by native or local annotators. We begin by selecting the top 50 most populous countries and use GPT-4-turbo to generate 100unique, country-specific cultural-legal guidelines for each, ensuring geo-diversity in GEOSAFEDB.These guidelines undergo a rigorous multi-step verification process, combining both automatedand human-based methods. Initially, verification is carried out using retrieval-augmented LLMslike Command-R and GPT-4-turbo, which validate the information against web-sourced data andpre-trained knowledge. Following this, geo-diverse human annotators from Amazon MechanicalTurk conduct a final round of validation, addressing common data quality issues encountered in priorresearch. Additionally, within a country, significant differences may exist between individual racesand regions. For example, while Indias national law prohibits cow slaughter due to the sacred statusof cows in Hinduism, some states like West Bengal allow it. To capture these nuances, we extendour methodology by generating region/race-specific cultural-legal guidelines. This is achieved byprompting GPT-4-turbo based on the country-level guidelines, followed by another round of stringentmachine and human validation to ensure the accuracy and representativeness of these region- and",

  "SAFEWORLD Query Generation": "After building GEOSAFEDB, we proceed to construct queries that reflect real-life geo-diversesafety scenarios. To ensure that the queries align with relevant use cases, we conduct surveys withparticipants from diverse geographical backgrounds (Appendix A.2). Using the survey insights,we design four distinct query types, each tailored to a specific response type. Every query inSAFEWORLD includes a scenario that illustrates a culturally or legally sensitive (or insensitive)context, accompanied by a related question. overviews our query generation process. Below,we detail the steps for designing these queries. show SAFEWORLD query examples. SPECIFICANSWER.These queries involve scenarios that have already violated the cultural-legalguidelines of the queried country, race, or region. While the questions themselves might not beculturally or legally unsafe, LLMs should identify the specific guideline that has been violated in thecontext scenario when providing a response. To generate such SPECIFICANSWER queries, we createnorm- or policy-violating scenarios and corresponding questions for each cultural-legal guidelinegv DC DL, using carefully crafted prompts for GPT-4-turbo.",
  "Norms322286218357Policies319291190367": "responses covering representative regions where such scenarios might be unsafe. To generatethese queries, we cluster N instances of violated cultural-legal guidelines from SPECIFICANSWERqueries into M1 clusters using K-Means , based on the norm and policy embeddings fromINSTRUCTOR . This identifies cultural-legal guidelines with shared topics. Based on them, theCOMPREANSWER query generation can be more coherent to the shared topics and indeed involvethose guidelines. Specifically, for each cluster, we prompt GPT-4-turbo to create K1 scenarios andquestions integrating the guidelines into contexts where they are violated, producing K1M1 queries. REFUSETOANSWER.Models should consistently avoid directly addressing certain inappropriatequeries, such as those that compare cultural or legal systems or impose one groups guidelines ontoanother. To generate scenarios involving two countries, races, or regions, we cluster N instances ofviolated norms or policies from SPECIFICANSWER queries into M2 clusters using INSTRUCTOR,similar to the construction of COMPREANSWER queries. For each cluster, GPT-4-turbo generatesK2 scenarios and corresponding questions by embedding these norms or policies in various contextsrelated to specific races or regions, producing a total of K2 M2 queries. DOANSWER.DOANSWER queries consist of scenarios and questions that adhere to cultural-legalguidelines. They evaluate a models ability to provide helpful responses without mistakenly raisingred flags, similar to assessing a models precision. To construct these queries, we synthesize ascenario adhering to a specific cultural-legal guideline ga DC DL using GPT-4-turbo. Since thescenarios are designed to be safe, we generate relevant questions without any restrictions. By construction, this data collection process naturally annotates each instance in the SAFEWORLDbenchmark with the query type, the expected response type ry, and the associated cultural-legalguideline ky. For SPECIFICANSWER and COMPREANSWER queries, ky specifies the violatedguideline, denoted as ky = {gv}. In contrast, for DOANSWER queries, ky identifies the guidelinethat is followed, represented as ky = {ga}. For REFUSETOANSWER queries, ky is an empty set(ky = ), indicating that no guidelines are either violated or adhered to, and their responses donot reference any specific guidelines. After generating these queries, we employ a multi-roundvalidation process involving both machines and humans. The final evaluation set consists of 2,342human-verified queries, while the remaining queries sreve as raw training data, detailed in 5.2. Forfurther information on query generation, refer to Appendix A.3.",
  "SAFEWORLD Automatic Evaluation Framework": "Our SAFEWORLD evaluation aims to assess how contextually appropriate, accurate, and compre-hensive LLM responses are when addressing the four types of geo-diverse safety queries outlinedin 3. We implement the following evaluation protocols: (1) Response Type Matching (4.1); (2)Reference-Based Faithfulness and Coverage (4.2); (3) Reference-Free Factuality (4.3). Note thatfaithfulness and coverage are only applicable to SPECIFICANSWER and COMPREANSWER queries.These types of queries require generating responses that accurately mirror and encompass specificnorms and policies outlined in the ground-truth guidelines. In contrast, REFUSETOANSWER andDOANSWER queries do not include these guidelines, as they involve responses that either directlyaddress or avoid the topic without necessarily referencing cultural norms or policies explicitly.",
  "Response Type Matching": "As described in 3, each query is associated with an expected response type, denoted as R ={SPECIFICANSWER, COMPREANSWER, REFUSETOANSWER, DOANSWER}. This evaluationprotocol aims to determine whether the type of a models generated response matches the expectedresponse type. For example, in the case of DOANSWER queries, a models response is considereda match if it addresses the query directly without raising any violation alerts. On the other hand, aresponse is deemed unmatched for REFUSETOANSWER queries if the model provides an answer when",
  "Reference-based Faithfulness and Coverage Evaluation": "In the second evaluation dimension, we aim to determine whether models accurately identify andreference the norms or laws that are violated. To achieve this, we propose reference-based metrics toevaluate the faithfulness and coverage of model responses . These metrics require firstextracting the norms or policies from a models response, denoted as ky = {ky1, ..., kyL}, using GPT-4-turbo. Faithfulness measures how accurately the models response aligns with the ground-truthnorms or policies. It is calculated as: FAITHFULNESS(ky, ky) = |ky ky|/|ky| . A higherfaithfulness score indicates that the models response is more precise in referencing the expectednorms or policies. Coverage, on the other hand, evaluates the comprehensiveness of the modelsresponse, indicating how well it captures the entirety of the ground-truth norms embedded in thequery. It is defined as: COVERAGE(ky, ky) = |ky ky|/|ky| . A higher coverage scoresuggests that the model has referenced a more complete set of relevant norms or policies.",
  "Reference-free Factuality Evaluation": "To address situations where the norms or policies mentioned in the generated response are accuratebut not covered by our annotated ground-truth norms or policies ky, we leverage the state-of-the-artretrieval-augmented LLM, Command-R. This model helps evaluate whether the norms or policiesextracted from the models response, ky, can be verified using online sources. This process is crucialfor assessing the factuality (i.e., factual accuracy) of the generated content, as discussed in priorworks . Let kyfact ky represent the subset of norms or policies that can be validated usinginformation found on the web. We define factuality as: FACTUALITY(ky, kyfact) = |kyfact|/|ky| .This metric measures the proportion of extracted norms or policies that are verifiable, providing aclearer indication of the responses factual accuracy.",
  "LLM Evaluation Results": "We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of six open-source (Zephyr, LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Mistral)and five proprietary (OpenAI and Cohere families) LLMs. Detailed information about the modelversions can be found in Appendix . Each model is rigorously tested against our newlyproposed SAFEWORLD benchmark. We assess model responses across the three dimensions outlinedabove. The results of these evaluations are presented in . LLaMA & Mistral vs. Proprietary LLMs.The LLaMA and Mistral-series models demonstrateimpressive performance against proprietary LLMs. Notably, some models outperform GPT-3.5-turboand Command-R/R+ in coverage, faithfulness, and factuality. Moreover, they even exceed GPT-4-turbo in response type classification. This success underscores the potential of open-source modelsto leverage relevant knowledge effectively, especially in addressing geo-diverse safety scenarios,achieving performance levels comparable to leading proprietary models like the GPT series. Scrutiny on GPT and Command-R Performance.The query generation method described in3.3 uses cultural-legal guidelines generated by GPT-4-turbo to create the basis for test queries.This implies that GPT-4-turbo has internalized much of the cultural norms and policy knowledge",
  "GPT-3.5-turbo0.1980.1220.4840.279GPT-4-turbo0.3800.1620.6170.285GPT-4o0.3010.1410.5600.268": "present within the test set. However, in real-world scenarios that implicitly involve these cultural-legalguidelines, GPT-4-turbo often struggles to recognize and respond to them appropriately. Additionally,the Command-R models, which utilize web-scale retrieval-augmented generation, do not performbetter on the SAFEWORLD testing scenarios. This highlights a critical limitation: despite using theweb-scale retrieval, LLMs can still struggle to accurately retrieve and apply the relevant norms andpolicies in nuanced contexts. How can we improve LLMs geo-safety awareness?Despite GPT-4-turbo possessing the knowl-edge to respond to geo-diverse safety queries, its failures suggest that additional alignment methodsmight be necessary to effectively elicit and apply this knowledge in model responses. In particular,existing LLMs often struggle to generate the correct type of response and to ensure that their outputsfaithfully adhere to the cultural-legal guidelines pertinent to each query. This insight that targetedalignment on these two aspects could enhance overall response quality motivates our subsequentstudy in 5 on geo-diverse safety alignment methods. Note that in Appendix B.2, we present two sets of evaluation results. Appendix D.1 demonstratesthe high correlation with human judgments achieved by the proposed evaluation framework, whichvalidates the effectiveness of our evaluation strategy.",
  "Geo-Diverse Safety Alignment Training": "To align model responses with geo-diverse safety standards and appropriate responding practices,we employ Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) , a commonly used alignment method. Thismethod fine-tunes open-source LLMs to effectively address global user queries, ensuring safety andutility. It requires high-quality simulated user queries and response preference pairs, guiding modelsto generate more appropriate responses. This section outlines the creation of alignment training data,SAFEWORLDALIGN (5.2) and details the training settings (5.3).",
  "SAFEWORLDALIGN Alignment Training Data Generation": "DPO training requires preference pair annotations, consisting of a user query Q, a positive responseRp, and a negative response Rn. We detail how we synthesize these three key components: (1)Training Query Generation: Detailed in 3.3.2, this process relies on high-quality, human-verifiedannotations of cultural-legal guidelines to ensure the generated queries cover geo-diverse safetytopics accurately and comprehensively. (2) Positive Response Generation: For a training userquery Q regarding cultural norm or policy I, we generate a safe and useful positive response Rpthat incorporate I using tailored prompts. Specifically, for a query of Type t, we deploy a customprompt crafted to elicit responses that align with the desired characteristics for that query type. (3)Negative Response Generation: Motivated from the observations from 4.4 about the current LLMsweaknesses, for a Type t training query Q related to a specific cultural norm or policy I, we createtwo distinct categories of negative responses for constructing the preference pairs: Negative Category 1 consists of negative responses that adhere to correct cultural-legal guideline Ibut correspond to a different response type t where t = t. Specifically, for a query of Type t, weutilize a prompt that tailors for generating the response with a different type t that misaligns with thequery type. For example, consider a SPECIFICANSWER query that demands an alerted response to aviolated cultural norm or policy. A negative response for this category could be drawn from responseDOANSWER, which fails to provide any reminders of the violation. This misalignment between thequery and response type further encourages the model to acquire the desired behavior of LLMs whenfaced with diverse global user queries. Negative Category 2 consists of negative responses that match the user query type t but refer toincorrect cultural norms and policies I where I = I. For example, if the correct guideline is aboutinfidelity to the wife or girlfriend, a negative response contains a perturbed incorrect guideline I (e.g.,the green hat is offensive to elders). Generating negative responses with the reference of incorrectguidelines I via LLM prompting ensures these factual errors in the responses while being relevantwith the user queries and encourages the model to precisely distinguish and memorize the correctcultural norms and policies. Note that since REFUSETOANSWER queries require only refusal andlack involved cultural norm and policy information, we do not generate responses for this negativeresponse category across all REFUSETOANSWER queries.",
  "Alignment Training Settings": "Following the open-source LLM alignment method from the Huggingface Alignment Handbook ,we employ DPO training on top of an initial reference policy, Zephyr-7B-SFT-Full, an already super-vised fine-tuned model. To maintain evaluation integrity, we exclude training queries involvingcultural-legal guidelines present in the test set, preventing data leakage and ensuring rigoroustesting of the models ability to generalize. The final DPO training dataset, SAFEWORLDALIGNcontains 45,746 preference pairs: 26,382 for Negative Category 1 and 19,364 for Negative Category2. We refer to our alignment models as SAFEWORLDLM. See Appendix C for parameter details.",
  "SAFEWORLDLM Evaluation Results": "In this section, we provide an in-depth evaluation and analysis of the performance of our SAFE-WORLDLM on SAFEWORLD. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to highlight the effectivenessof our specially constructed DPO training data. Our analysis spans both SAFEWORLD and generalNLP and safety evaluation benchmarks, demonstrating the robust improvements our approach offers.",

Notably, our leadingSAFEWORLDLM model surpasses top-tier proprietary models like GPT-4-turbo and GPT-4o in alldimensions, with especially notable gains in response type classification, showing improvements of20.5% and 18.8%, respectively. These impressive results highlight our models unparalleled ability toadapt and respond effectively across a wide range of query types. As we discuss in 4.4, GPT-4-turbooften struggles to recognize and respond to the queries appropriately, where the relevant guidelinesare embedded in its parametric knowledge. What if we enhance GPTs with additional guidance? In , we compare our SAFEWORLDLM-series LLMs against various prompting baselines that provide explicit instructions for consideringregional differences established upon the top-performing GPT-series model, GPT-4-turbo. Addi-tionally, we include baselines that integrate both ground-truth cultural-legal guidelines and relevantguidelines retrieved from SAFEWORLD in the user prompt. We find that even if we provide explicithints to GPT-4-turbo, our SAFEWORLDLM-series LLMs still demonstrate superior performance, un-derscoring the substantial benefits of additional safety alignment training. Although SAFEWORLDLMscores lower in faithfulness compared to GPT-4-turbo w/ Ground-Truth Guidelines, this difference isprimarily because the baseline model directly utilizes ground-truth guidelines. We also notice thatthere are still occasional inconsistencies where GPT-4-turbo might not integrate the provided ground-truth guidelines into its responses, thereby resulting in lower coverage score. Overall, we observe thatSAFEWORLDLM and its variants perform competitively even compared to a state-of-the-art modelssupplemented with additional human-written guidelines. This highlights the value of our alignmenttraining method, which enhances the models ability to identify and adapt to diverse cultural andlegal norms across different regions. Ablation Studies.To understand the impact of different components in our alignment training,we conduct ablation studies on different variants of SAFEWORLDLM. We tested three variants: (1)SAFEWORLDLM w/o Neg. Category 1 is the variant trained with only the preference pairs contain-ing the negative responses based on incorrect norm and policy knowledge. (2) SAFEWORLDLMw/o Neg. Category 2 is the model trained with only the preference pairs containing the negativeresponses with incorrect response types. (3) SAFEWORLDLM (50%) represents another varianttrained using half of the total SAFEWORLD align training dataset, incorporating both types of nega-tive responses, designed for a fair comparison with the previous two variants thanks to the matchedamount of training data. As shown in , the first two variants show distinct advantages. SAFE-WORLDLM w/o Neg. Category 1 shows better proficiency in factuality, while SAFEWORLDLM w/oNeg. Category 2 outperforms in response type matching. This can be attributed to the distinct trainingapproaches: SAFEWORLDLM w/o Neg. Category 1 uses preference pair data that emphasizes thecontrast between involved norms and policy contents, enabling it to generate more precise and factualresponses. On the other hand, SAFEWORLDLM w/o Neg. Category 2 is tailored to better understandand align with the desired behaviors associated with global user query types. This disparity revealsthat different negative response generation strategies can significantly enhance model performance inspecific key evaluation dimensions critical to the SAFEWORLD benchmark. Furthermore, comparingSAFEWORLDLM (50%) with the former two variants shows that it achieves better performanceacross all evaluation dimensions, indicating that a more holistic improvement in model performancecan be achieved by integrating diverse types of preference pairs.",
  "General NLP and Safety Benchmark Evaluation Results": "To further assess the impact of our SAFEWORLD training data on both general NLP and safetybenchmarks, we conduct additional experiments to investigate that the geo-diverse safety align-ment does not compromise performance on downstream tasks. We select two general NLP tasks,MMLU and HellaSwag , from the Open LLM Leaderboard on Huggingface. Following theleaderboards few-shot evaluation framework, we provide 5-shot and 10-shot in-context examples forMMLU and HellaSwag, respectively. We also evaluate the models on two general safety benchmarks:Anthropic HH-RLHF and BeaverTails . Using the methodology from , we measure theproportion of harmless responses in the test sets as our primary safety metric, implemented throughGPT prompting. We compare SAFEWORLDLM with the base model Zephyr-7B-SFT-Full to see theimpact of SAFEWORLDALIGN on the general tasks. We find that training on SAFEWORLDALIGN can achieve 96.5% and 80.2% harmless response ratios,significantly superior to Zephyr-7B-SFT-Fulls performance of 59.3% and 74.2% on the two generalsafety benchmarks, HH-RLHF and BeaverTails. Additionally, we observe that SAFEWORLDALIGNsperformance on two general NLP tasks, MMLU and HellaSwag, is 56.6% and 78.5%, matching56.8% and 78.5% performance of Zephyr-7B-SFT-Full, even though SAFEWORLDALIGN is designedfor geo-diverse safety alignment. These findings suggest that SAFEWORLDALIGN enables modelsto significantly enhance geo-diverse and general safety alignment while maintaining performanceon general NLP tasks. In Appendix D.2, we provide further analysis showing that combiningSAFEWORLDALIGN with general alignment data, such as ULTRAFEEDBACK and SAFER-INSTRUCT,enhances performance beyond using ULTRAFEEDBACK and SAFER-INSTRUCT alone, respectively.",
  ": Results of comparativeevaluation by global annotators": "We further conduct human evaluation to showcase the effective-ness of SAFEWORLDLM according to the global annotator feed-backs. Following standard settings for evaluating LLMs abilityto follow instructions , we recruit global annotators from9 different countries as the users to compare and rate model re-sponses to geo-diverse safety queries based on helpfulness andharmlessness. We randomly sample 40 queries from each querytype for the human evaluation. From , we find that SAFE-WORLDLM achieves an 18-20% higher winning rate than GPT-4o in both dimensions, further demonstrating SAFEWORLDLMseffectiveness and its global acceptability among users.",
  "Western vs. Non-Western": "One of the key objectives of studying geo-diverse safety align-ment is to ensure models to perform equitably across both Western and non-Western countries, therebydelivering fair benefits to users worldwide. To achieve this, we analyze performance disparitiesbetween instances involving Western and non-Western countries, where smaller disparities indicategreater inclusivity. Notably, apart from the response type alignment dimension, SAFEWORLDLMdemonstrates smaller disparities compared to GPT-4o and Command-R+. We attribute this improve-ment to the richer emphasis on non-Western knowledge in our training data, as illustrated in .This focus likely contributes to the models more balanced performance across different regions.These results highlight our commitment to developing inclusive models that cater effectively to adiverse global audience.",
  "Conclusion": "We introduce SAFEWORLD, a novel benchmark for evaluating safety alignment across diverse globalcontexts, ensuring LLMs cater to worldwide user needs. For comprehensively assess LLM response,we propose a multi-dimensional safety evaluation framework focusing on key dimensions needed foraddress user queries involving geo-diverse safety topics. Beyond evaluation, we present a geo-diversesafety alignment training method, encouraging models to acquire desired behaviors and preciselydistinguish and memorize the cultural-legal guidelines. Our approach significantly enhances geo-diverse safety alignment, outperforming GPT-4o, while maintaining strong performance on generalNLP and safety tasks.",

  ": Overview of GEOSAFEDB database generation": "The initial phase of SAFEWORLD focuses on developing GEOSAFEDB, a culturally and legallygeo-diverse safety database. This database includes cultural norms and public policies from variousgeographic backgrounds. Previous methods face challenges such as limited relevance to safetyconcerns and compromised data quality, often due to top-down collection methods and insufficientannotation processes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a bottom-up approach that gatherscountry- and region-level guidelines through LLM prompting, followed by validation by native orlocal annotators, ensuring both accuracy and cultural and legal sensitivity.",
  "Country-level Cultural Norms Generation Prompt": "Provide <NUM> distinctive and special sensitive cultural norms (e.g., practices, beliefs, or taboos) in <COUNTRY> that significantly differ from those in other countries. Aim for a varied selection that spans various aspects of life, including social etiquette, religious observances, familial interactions, and community rituals, to provide a comprehensive insight into the country's unique cultural landscape.",

Aim for a varied selection that spans various aspects of life to provide a comprehensive insight into the country's unique policy and law landscape.",
  ": Prompts for GPT-4-turbo to country-level cultural-legal guidelines": "We select the top 50 most populous countries2 and use GPT-4-turbo with prompts from togenerate 100 unique, country-specific cultural-legal guidelines for each, ensuring geo-diversity inSAFEWORLD. These guidelines then undergo a multi-step, rigorous verification process involvingboth machine and human-based validation. We employ retrieval-augmented LLMs like Command-R3and GPT-4-turbo to cross-check the guidelines against web-based information and pre-trained knowl-edge. Specifically, Command-R assesses each norm and policy using the prompt: Do you think<NORM/POLICY> is a well-known [cultural norm/policy] in <COUNTRY>? Guidelinesthat receive a response of Yes or Unsure, are retained, leveraging Command-Rs precision inRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to validate norms and policies using online information.Subsequently, GPT-4 re-evaluates the filtered norms and policies using the same prompt, with onlythose receiving a Yes moving forward. For a final layer of validation, global human annotatorsfrom the selected 50 countries, sourced through Amazon Mechanical Turk Platform, review theguidelines. nnotators were selected through a qualification test that included a reading comprehensiontask and a simulated verification exercise. Each guideline was reviewed by three annotators from therespective country, with an Unsure option available to accommodate the diversity within countries. displays screenshots of the qualification process and the verification task. Annotatorswere compensated at a rate of $15 per hour. Due to budget constraints, human annotators were notrecruited for policy validation; instead, we relied on machine-based verification, which demonstrateda high correlation (0.92) with human validation in a pilot test with 50 examples. Additionally, within a country, cultural and legal practices can vary significantly between regionsand among different racial or ethnic groups. For example, in India, while national laws generallyprohibit cow slaughter due to the sacred status of cows in Hinduism, certain states like WestBengal permit it. To capture these nuances, we include region-level cultural-legal guidelines byprompting GPT-4-turbo based on the country-level guidelines: Are there any variations ofthe given [norm/policy] in <COUNTRY> related to different regions or races?Please list three to five variations. Our data collection process incorporates thoroughmachine and human validation to ensure that each regions cultural-legal landscape is accurately andcomprehensively represented. This approach yields a dataset of 7,447 cultural norms (DC) and 6,652public policies (DL) spanning 50 countries and 493 regions and racial groups.",

Among the 21 respondents from 8 differentcountries, 11 expressed a preference for all three response types, while only 2 opted for none. Basedon these insights, we decided to include all three query types in our study. Additionally, to enhancethe complexity of the safety benchmark and to discourage models from overly frequent alerts aboutnorm or policy violations, we incorporated DOANSWER queries into our evaluation.",

To generate such SPECIFICANSWER queries, we create norm- or policy-violating scenarios and corresponding questions for each cultural-legal guideline gv DC DL,using carefully crafted prompts for GPT-4-turbo. COMPREANSWER.For scenarios where no specific countries, races, or regions are mentioned,but potentially violate norms or laws of some communities, models should provide comprehensiveresponses covering representative regions where such scenarios might be unsafe.

This identifies cultural-legal guidelines with shared topics. Based on them, theCOMPREANSWER query generation can be more coherent to the shared topics and indeed involvethose guidelines. Specifically, for each cluster, we prompt GPT-4-turbo to create K1 scenarios andquestions integrating the guidelines into contexts where they are violated, producing K1M1 queries. REFUSETOANSWER.Models should consistently avoid directly addressing certain inappropriatequeries, such as those that compare cultural or legal systems or impose one groups guidelines ontoanother.

To construct these queries, we synthesize ascenario adhering to a specific cultural-legal guideline ga DC DL using GPT-4-turbo. Since thescenarios are designed to be safe, we generate relevant questions without any restrictions.",
  "Empirically, we choose M1 = M2 = 250 and K1 = K2 = 10 in our query generation": "By construction, this data collection process naturally annotates each instance in the SAFEWORLDbenchmark with the query type, the expected response type ry, and the associated cultural-legalguideline ky. For SPECIFICANSWER and COMPREANSWER queries, ky specifies the violatedguideline, denoted as ky = {gv}. In contrast, for DOANSWER queries, ky identifies the guidelinethat is followed, represented as ky = {ga}. For REFUSETOANSWER queries, ky is an empty set(ky = ), indicating that no guidelines are either violated or adhered to, and their responses do notreference any specific guidelines. After generating these queries, we employ a multi-round validationprocess involving both machines and humans. Initially, we use GPT-4-turbo to assess the relevanceof each query against our established criteria for cultural and legal safety, as outlined in 3.1. Queriesare rated on a scale from 1 (least relevant) to 5 (most relevant), retaining only those with a score of 4or higher. The Original columns in display the number of queries that remain after thismachine validation step. To ensure a high-quality evaluation set, we randomly sample 500 queriesfrom each category, maintaining a balanced distribution across different countries. These sampledqueries are then further validated by two experienced annotators. Only those that receive unanimousapproval for both validity and relevance are included in the final evaluation set. This rigorous processresults in a dataset of 2,342 human-verified queries, forming the core of our evaluation set.
