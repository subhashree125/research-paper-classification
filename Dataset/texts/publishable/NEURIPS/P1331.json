  "Abstract": "We propose a pipeline for gaining insights intocomplex diseases by training LLMs on chal-lenging social media text data classicationtasks, obtaining explanations for the classi-cation outputs, and performing qualitative andquantitative analysis on the explanations. Wereport initial results on predicting, explaining,and systematizing the explanations of predictedreports on mental health concerns in people re-porting Lyme disease concerns. We report ini-tial results on predicting future ADHD concernsfor people reporting anxiety disorder concerns,and demonstrate preliminary results on visu-alizing the explanations for predicting that aperson with anxiety concerns will in the futurehave ADHD concerns.Keywords: Mental Health, Anxiety Disorder,ADHD, Lyme disease, RoBERTa, ExplainableAI, Qualitative Analysis",
  ". Use quantitative and qualitative analyses to gainnew insights from the data": "In this work, we apply this approach to two tasks.First, building on the work in (Lee et al., 2024), weclassify social media users in the r/anxiety subred-dit who have not yet posted in the r/ADHD subred-dit as ones that will or will not post in the r/ADHDsubreddit in the future, and then visualize the ex-planations for that classier. The task is interestingbecause it can be used as a proxy task for detect-ing ADHD concerns in people with anxiety concerns,because the task seems impossible for keyword-basedarchitectures (Lee et al., 2024), and the visualizationof prediction explanations in this task can lead in toinsights about both symptoms and nosology of anxi-ety disorders and ADHD. Second, we classify Redditposts that potentially contain concerns about Lymedisease as possibly containing mental health concernsrelated to Lyme or not containing mental health re-lated to Lyme, based on a small manually-labelleddataset. The task is interesting because it allows us",
  ". Background": "Research shows that up to 53% of adults with ADHDmay also suer from an anxiety disorder, while ap-proximately 28% of adults with an anxiety disordermay have undiagnosed ADHD (Quinn and Madhoo,2014) (Ameringen et al., 2011).This overlap cancomplicate clinical decision-making, as anxiety or de-pression symptoms are often treated without rec-ognizing the potential presence of ADHD, result-ing in only the symptoms for anxiety being treatedand ADHD beign left untreated (Katzman et al.,2017).Lyme disease is known for its signicantneurological and psychological impacts.Approxi-mately 40% of individuals diagnosed with Lyme dis-ease experience neurological symptoms, with a no-table percentage also developing mental health dis-orders (Fallon and Nields, 1994).The prevalenceof mental health disorders for those diagnosed withLyme disease is much higher than in the general pop-ulation (Fallon et al., 2021).",
  ". Will exclusive /r/Anxiety poster alsopost in /r/ADHD in the future?": "In Lee et al. (2024), data is collected from Redditto classify posts from users who only discuss anxi-ety in the /r/Anxiety subreddit versus those whotransition from posting in the /r/Anxiety to dis-cussing ADHD in /r/Anxiety.This classicationtask serves as a proxy for identifying individuals whomight be developing awareness of their potential co-morbid ADHD condition.",
  ". Datasets": "ADHD and Anxiety DatasetText data is col-lected from the /r/Anxiety and /r/ADHD subred-dits (Lee et al., 2024). Posts are included if users ex-clusively post in the /r/Anxiety or initially postedthere before starting to also post in /r/ADHD, witha total of 47,482 posts collected from before 2023.Posts from /r/ADHD are excluded if posted within sixmonths of the rst /r/Anxiety post. This results ina total of 47,482 posts, of which 33% are retained fortesting purposes. Manually-labelled Mental-Health-RelatedSymptoms of Lyme disease DatasetWe col-lect a dataset of 58,398 Reddit posts containing theterm Lyme from Reddit from before 2022. A sub-set of 343 posts is manually labeled as mental-health-related or non-health-related based on specic crite-ria. Any of the following are reasons to label a post asmental-health-related: 1) Mention of specic mentalhealth symptoms 2) Ideation of self-harm or suicide3) emotional distress 4) anger management issues 5)social relationship challenges 6) persistent feelings ofemptiness 7) Substance use issues.",
  "ADHDandAnxiety": "Post: I missed a deadline by several days and Im extremely stressed. I havent felt well overthe past weekend. Ive had multiple arguments with my mom, and our relationship is morestrained than ever. I ended up procrastinating and avoided urgent tasks, including reading theemail about the assignment I missed. I nally checked it today and realized Ive been behindfor days. I know I should explain the situation to my instructor and complete the work as soonas possible, but the consequences feel signicant this time, and I cant stop worrying about it.I also dont know how to explain my situation without it sounding like Im making excuses.Im lost. I cant even focus on the email to understand what I need to do now; my eyes literallyhurt from reading it.",
  "LymeandMentalHealth": "Post: Five years ago, I contracted Lyme disease and experienced something quite unusualand intriguing; my brain felt like it was constantly operating at full capacity. Its hard to putthe sensation into words, but I recall it involved a struggle to gauge size (everything appearedenormous yet proportional to everything else, including myself), which made me constantlyattempt to render objects in my mind without any success. This phenomenon only occurredat night and was particularly noticeable when I tried to fall asleep and began to lightly dreambefore dozing o. On the nights this occurred, I would be in a delirious state in all but oneinstance (total of 5-6 episodes). Although these episodes began when I got Lyme disease, theycontinued sporadically afterward, with the last one occurring about two years after the initialinfection, and were usually, though not always, linked to a fever. Is there a name for thisphenomenon? Where can I nd more information about it?",
  ". Generating explanations": "We generate explanations as follows for the RoBERTaclassier: each post is broken up into phrases (de-ned as sentence fragments enclosed in punctuationmarks). Each phrase in turn is masked out, and thephrases that inuence the classier output the mostare highlighted. The examples of RoBERTa classi-ers highlights on Reddit posts for mental health in-dicators are shown in , and more examples forLyme disease posts related to mental health are pre-",
  ". Look through the top 300 matches for each groupof explanations in the reference r/AskDocs cor-pus": "Preliminary results are available in . Weidentify that the mold theme appears more prevalentin the Lyme dataset than in the baseline AskDocsdataset (p-value < 0.01 when using a simple randomsample model) in the hand-labelled top 300 matchesfor the symptom description, indicating a potentialavenue to explore in the three-way interaction ofexpressing concern about Lyme, expressing mental-health concerns, and speaking about mold.",
  ". Conclusion": "We work with two mental-health-related social mediatext datasets. We demonstrate a pipeline of identify-ing an interesting and challenging classication task,obtaining explanations for RoBERTas classicationdecisions on the tasks, and exploring those explana-tions. For the Lyme dataset, we demonstrate prelim-inary results showing a proof-of-concept of a pipelinewhere the explanations of the classier are used inorder to identify interesting patterns in the dataset.

  "Examples": "Post: my partner has been dealing with lyme since around 2015. he has a hard time managing his hippain, neck and back pain, persistent headaches that disturb his sleep, diculty sleeping due to anxiety,and overall heightened anxiety levels. ive never met someone with lyme before. i want to support himbut need advice on how friends or family can best help someone with lyme. update: just got dumpedfor his ex, lol. Post: ive recently experienced a number of strange, debilitating symptoms. it began with a sti neckin late november, and in the past week, it has rapidly worsened to include headaches, severe depression,a sense of unreality, hand tremors, poor coordination, no appetite or thirst, visual disturbances, andfeeling extremely hot or cold in dierent parts of my body. Post: i had personality disorders before contracting lyme, and its interfering with my recovery, i feelcompletely empty and unmotivated, struggling with dependency issues, wanting to be taken care of,and lacking any willpower. healing from lyme would be easier if my mental health wasnt such anobstacle. sometimes i end up not eating or falling into depression, losing the will to get up in themorning. i cant even commit to taking supplements or changing my diet anymore. im afraid mymental health issues might be my downfall. Post: derealization and depersonalization (dpdr) feels like being intoxicated or out of reality, oatingsensations, a feeling of disconnection from your body, thoughts, or words. you dont recognize yourselfor loved ones anymore. its a terrifying experience. it feels like your brain is permanently altered, andit seems like it will never return to normal. has anyone here successfully treated this symptom? i havelyme and other co-infections, conrmed by cdc tests, and am ve months into antibiotic treatment. Post: january 23: sensation of bugs crawling on my scalp, had a paranoid episode thinking i had licewhen i didnt. persistent crawling sensation led to paranoia, depression, and brain fog, forgetfulnesswith words. later that january: discovered a bump on my scalp, scratched it o, and it bled exces-sively. the area around it had a bullseye appearance. never saw a tick but had continuous crawlingsensations. february 23: teeth grinding, jaw locking. thought it was related to my adhd meds, brainfog, forgetfulness, attributed to adhd. menstrual cycle became longer, around 30-32 days. march 23:hospital admission for unexplained chest pain. abnormal blood tests suggested a possible infection butwas sent home. cycle was again irregular, 32-33 days. april 23: noticed signicant cognitive decline,increased adhd medication dosage. diculty nding words, staying up later, restlessness, poor sleepquality. may 23: severe foot pain in the morning, diculty walking, tight calf muscles, intense pmssymptoms, extended cycle to 36 days, elevated liver enzymes. Post: hi everyone. ive been battling Lyme disease for over four years. my pain has been particularlysevere lately, disrupting my sleep and worsening my mood. its making me less active and exacerbatingmy erratic sleep schedule. what pain management strategies or sleep aids have worked well for you?pain medications arent eective, and heat pads arent helping. im at a loss, any suggestions? Post: have you experienced anhedonia due to lyme? to clarify, i dont mean general depression orreduced enjoyment, but a complete inability to feel pleasure or love for others. total numbness. irarely see discussions about this symptom, and when i do, it often sounds like its mistaken for majordepression. total atness and emotional numbness. has anyone else experienced this? how long did itlast?"
