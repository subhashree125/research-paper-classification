  "Abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to a slew of adversarial attacksand jailbreaking methods. One common approach employed by white-hat attackers,or red-teamers, is to process model inputs and outputs using string-level obfus-cations, which can include leetspeak, rotary ciphers, Base64, ASCII, and more.Our work extends these encoding-based attacks by unifying them in a frameworkof invertible string transformations. With invertibility, we can devise arbitrarystring compositions, defined as sequences of transformations, that we can encodeand decode end-to-end programmatically. We devise a automated best-of-n attackthat samples from a combinatorially large number of string compositions. Ourjailbreaks obtain competitive attack success rates on several leading frontier modelswhen evaluated on HarmBench, highlighting that encoding-based attacks remain apersistent vulnerability even in advanced LLMs.",
  "Problem setting": "The best large language models (LLMs) today boast advanced reasoning capabilities and extensiveworld knowledge, making them susceptible to more severe risks and misuse cases. To mitigate theserisks, model creators have devoted substantial research efforts to model alignment. One essentialcomponent of the alignment pipeline is red-teaming, or the rigorous evaluation of models to identifyvulnerabilities and weaknesses. By better understanding the attack surface of frontier languagemodels, we can, in turn, better understand the shortcomings of current alignment measures and helpsafety researchers on the blue-team build more robust AI systems. In particular, were interested in jailbreak methods that are automated. With so many frontier AIsystems deployed in so many downstream settings, redteaming efforts can benefit greatly fromscalability. Automated attacks can be applied to various models, risk categories, and tasks withno case-by-case manual tuning, making them scalable. In addition, many redteaming pipelinesemploy manually generated attacks (Li et al., 2024; the Prompter, 2024; Andriushchenko et al., 2024);complementing these methods with automated attacks helps convert manual intuitions into a moresystematic understanding of model vulnerabilities. Currently, the redteaming community has employed various string-level obfuscations as attackmechanisms (Wei et al., 2024). For example, previous jailbreaks have encoded the input and/orinstructed the model to respond in leetspeak (the Prompter, 2024), Morse Code (Barak, 2023), code(Kang et al., 2023), low-resource languages (Yong et al., 2023), rotary ciphers or ASCII (Yuan et al.,2024; Jiang et al., 2024), and more. These encoding schemes are manually derived and somewhatpiecemeal, and our work aims to extend and unify these encodings into a more powerful automatedattack.",
  "arXiv:2411.01084v3 [cs.CL] 11 Dec 2024": "complex encoding, which we call a string composition, for use in an adversarial prompt. With 20individual transformations in our library, we can generate a combinatorially large number of stringcompositions. (2) Using this framework, we devise an automated best-of-n jailbreak: for a givenharmful intent, n random compositions are sampled and the model is considered jailbroken if at leastone composition produces an unsafe response. We benchmark our composition-based attacks andobtain impressive attack success rates on HarmBench across several frontier language models.",
  "Related work": "To reiterate, many encodings mentioned in the introduction, including leetspeak, Morse Code,low-resource language translations, rotary ciphers, and ASCII, fall under the purview of invertibletransformations. Besides encodings, the adversarial attack literature for language models has includedgradient-based discrete optimization (Zou et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Shin et al., 2020; Ebrahimiet al., 2017; Guo et al., 2021; Geisler et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024; Thompsonand Sklar, 2024); LLM-assisted prompt optimization (Chao et al., 2023; Mehrotra et al., 2023; Tanget al., 2024); multi-turn or many-shot attacks (Li et al., 2024; Haize Labs, 2024; Russinovich et al.,2024; Anil et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024); and other idiosyncratic attack vectors (Huang et al., 2024;Andriushchenko and Flammarion, 2024; Andriushchenko et al., 2024). Our work is closely inspired by Wei et al. (2024)s study of string transformations, which theycall obfuscation schemes. Wei et al. (2024) also explore a precursor for string compositions viatheir combination attacks, which compose multiple jailbreak mechanisms together. Our workbuilds upon Wei et al. (2024) by (1) studying a much larger set of string transformations, and (2)by designing an automated heuristic for generating arbitrary string compositions, leading to a morecomprehensive understanding of model vulnerabilities arising from encoded inputs.",
  "Invertible string transformations": "We first discuss our framework for string compositions. We generalize any encoding to be a deter-ministic string-level transformation f: Callable[[str], str] satisfying a few rules. Crucially,we require invertibility: there must exist a function f 1 such that f 1(f(s)) = s for any input texts. Most of the time, equality here denotes exact string match, but we also admit strings with lightdifferences such as lower/upper casing that dont impact the content of text. Invertibility helps withautomated jailbreaking, as encoded text can be decoded without manual intervention or correction. The invertibility requirement allows us to programatically construct string compositions. For exam-ple, say we want some text to be translated from English to German (f1 = German translation),then converted to leetspeak (f2 = leetspeak), then converted to Morse code (f3 = Morse code).Then the composition and its inverse, respectively, are",
  "xD1JUDGE(x,LLM(J(x)))=unsafe": "Here, J(x) denotes the input prompt for the harmful intent x after processing by jailbreak method J,LLM(inp) denotes the deterministic temperature-0 output of target model LLM from input prompt inp,and JUDGE denotes a system which classifies a model response, given a harmful intent, as safe orunsafe. Across our experiments, we use HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024), which provides a testset of 320 diverse harmful intents. HarmBench also provides a prompted classifier setup where anymodel may be used as a judge LLM for determining jailbreak efficacy; we employ the HarmBenchclassification prompt with GPT-4o-mini as the underlying JUDGE model.",
  "Attack setup": "For every transformation in our catalog (), we implement two deterministic functions forperforming the encoding and performing its inverse, respectively. For each transformation, we alsoinclude a string description which can be programmatically substituted into our prompt template.To teach a model about an arbitrary composition, we provide step-by-step instructions for how anexample text is sequentially transformed, via each of the compositions component transformations,to form a final encoded string. We programmatically generate these instructions by substitutingdescription strings, which are written for each transformation, into a prompt template. The exampletext used in the step-by-step instructions is a short pangram (a phrase including all 26 English alphabetletters) extended to include numerals and assorted punctuation. Specifically, the example string is:",
  "Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugsin other words, 60 (yes, sixty!)of them": "We inject string composition jailbreaks into our language model inputs in two ways: manuallytransforming our intent and/or and instructing the language model to provide its response alreadytransformed. Respectively, we say that we target the intent or target the response for composi-tion, respectively. If the composition targets the intent, we specify a single transformation, or notransformation, for the response; likewise, if the composition targets the response, we specify asingle transformation, or no transformation, for the intent. We dont instruct the model about theopposing single transformation; instead, we use few-shot examples so that the model picks up simpletransformations without explicit instruction. These few-shot examples are benign (intent, response)pairs with the intent and response separately encoded according to our specification.",
  "Ensembling transformations already leads to a strong jailbreak": "Before employing compositions, we first evaluate our attack setup employing only standalonetransformations. Previous works such as Wei et al. (2024) have evaluated several of our preexistingtransformations (leetspeak, Base64, ROT13, etc.) as attacks, but the jailbreak efficacy of our customtransformations (vowel repetition, prefix rotation, spoonerism, stuttering, etc.) is yet to be seen.Furthermore, the combined jailbreak efficacies of a large set of transformations, evaluated viaensembling, gives us deeper insight about model risks. Specifically, we aim to determine whetherinvertible string transformations generally exploit a common model vulnerability, or if differenttransformations target different facets of a models adversarial vulnerability. (This distinction isimportant for the blue team; the latter scenario, for example, may necessitate devising tailored modeldefenses for each possible transformation, instead of relying on one overarching defense for thegeneral concept of a string transformation.)",
  "harmful intent, if at least one of the standalone transformations resulted in a jailbreak, we say that theensemble attack jailbreaks that intent": "We evaluate standalone transformations and the ensemble attack across the Claude and GPT-4omodel families, and our results are displayed in . Our results validate the worst-case scenariofor language models adversarial vulnerability to invertible transformations. Many standalonetransformations yield unimpressive ASRs, but for every single model, the ensemble attack obtains asignificantly higher ASR than any single transformation. : Jailbreak efficacy on HarmBench for all transformations and for the ensemble attack. Foreach model, we employ the attack prompt in 3.2 using each standalone transformation in our catalogas a singleton composition. ASRs for each standalone transformation are displayed. We ensembleour attacks by counting an intent as jailbroken if at least one of the 20 standalone transformations ledto an unsafe response. The ensemble ASRs are displayed at the rightmost bar for each model.",

Right: we run the adaptive attack with attack budget n = 25 and reportASRs for three Claude models as well as GPT-4o-mini. Left: a non-adaptive attack (n = 1) obtainslow ASRs, so the retry-and-resample mechanism of our attack at higher attack budgets is crucial forjailbreaking a high number of intents. The equal ASRs for GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini at several n arenot a typo and actually arised in our experiment; we attribute these coincidences to divine whimsy.",
  "Plentiful jailbreaks with an automated adaptive attack": "Ultimately, our ensemble attack is still a limited attack vector, since it aggregates a fixed number offixed, deterministic transformations. Our ensemble attack results reveal that new string transforma-tions often exploit model vulnerabilities different than those exploited by known transformations, sowe can perform more effective red-teaming by reaching beyond our limited bank of transformations. For this purpose, string compositions become highly useful. Any composition may constitute asufficiently novel transformation in the context of language models adversarial vulnerability, andour setup allows us to sample thousands of compositions. We incorporate some light constraintsaround this samplingfor example, binary and Base64 encodings only make sense after word-leveltransformations, and style transformations such as JSON and LaTeX should always come lastbutcombinatorially, there are still thousands of valid compositions of, say, 2 or 3 transformations. Because it is infeasible to ensemble all compositions, we incorporate random sampling into anadaptive attack scheme. Given an attack budget n, for some harmful intent, we randomly sample ncompositions, generate n corresponding attacks via 3.2, and consider the intent jailbroken if at leastone composition resulted in a harmful response. We evaluate this adaptive attack, using attack budget n = 25, across the Claude and GPT-4o modelfamilies in . The adaptive attack obtains comparable ASRs to our previous ensemble attackwith a comparable attack budget. (The ensemble can be viewed as an adaptive attack with budgetn = 20.) This indicates that a randomly sampled composition, on average, may lead to as effective ofa standalone jailbreak as any of the single transformations in our bank. In addition, we can potentiallyscale to attack budgets in the thousands, thereby exposing a very wide portion of the attack surfacesof frontier language models.",
  "Conclusion": "By unifying disparate encoding-based attacks under the umbrella of invertible string transformations,and extending encoding-based attacks using arbitrary string compositions, we gain a more system-atized understanding of LLMs adversarial robustness under encoding and obfuscation schemes. Bothour ensemble and adaptive attacks are able to jailbreak leading frontier models on a high percentageof representative harmful intents. Our redteaming efforts underscore the continued vulnerability offrontier model to the attack vector of the invertible string transformation. We encourage model safetyresearchers to devote additional attention towards these generalized encoding-based attacks.",
