  "Missing Melodies: AI Music Generation and its \"Nearly\"Complete Omission of the Global South": "ATHARVA MEHTA, Research Associate at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, UAESHIVAM CHAUHAN, Research Associate at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence,UAEMONOJIT CHOUDHURY, Professor at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, UAE Recent advances in generative AI have sparked renewed interest and expanded possibilities for music genera-tion. However, the performance and versatility of these systems across musical genres are heavily influencedby the availability of training data. We conducted an extensive analysis of over one million hours of audiodatasets used in AI music generation research and manually reviewed more than 200 papers from elevenprominent AI and music conferences and organizations (AAAI, ACM, EUSIPCO, EURASIP, ICASSP, ICML, IJCAI,ISMIR, NeurIPS, NIME, SMC) to identify a critical gap in the fair representation and inclusion of the musicalgenres of the Global South in AI research.Our findings reveal a stark imbalance: approximately 86% of the total dataset hours and over 93% ofresearchers focus primarily on music from the Global North. However, around 40% of these datasets includesome form of non-Western music, genres from the Global South account for only 14.6% of the data. Furthermore,approximately 51% of the papers surveyed concentrate on symbolic music generation, a method that oftenfails to capture the cultural nuances inherent in music from regions such as South Asia, the Middle East, andAfrica. As AI increasingly shapes the creation and dissemination of music, the significant underrepresentationof music genres in datasets and research presents a serious threat to global musical diversity. We also proposesome important steps to mitigate these risks and foster a more inclusive future for AI-driven music generation.

  "Omission of Global South from AI Music Generation3": "focus on the inequities faced by genres from Global South countries in different aspects of musicgeneration and evaluation processes. To this end, we analyze many popular datasets and papersfrom eleven AI conferences and organizations and contrast these findings with the digital (online)and real-world (offline) popularity of musical genres. We also analyze the evaluation metrics usedfor assessing AI-generated music, focusing on the datasets used to train the backbone models thatconvert musical pieces into vector representations. The results of our analysis, summarized in and reveal almost a complete omission of the musical genres of the Global South inthe AI world. Approximately 86% of the total hours in available datasets and 93% of papers focusmajorly on the music of the Global North5. On the other hand, only 14.6% of the total hours ofmusic data and 6.1% of papers are first-authored by researchers from South Asian, Middle Eastern,Oceania, Central Asian, Latin American, and African countries. Popular backbone models forevaluating music generation systems have more than 50% representation of global instrumentswith regional instruments contributing less than 3% to the datasets used to train backbone models.This distributional skew in the training data is reflected in the quality of generated samples fromseveral popular systems, Jukebox, Suno, and Udio. Some examples are available for listening on ourGitHub page6. In this paper, we address the following research questions:",
  "(2) What is the regional distribution (affiliations) of researchers contributing to the music gener-ation field and how reliable are evaluation systems in measuring diverse musical styles?": "(3) What is the correlation between the attention and investment received by the differentmusical genres and their popularity and prevalence in the real and digital worlds?In the next section, we describe our findings, and their broader implications and a few importantsolutions are presented in . We conclude all findings and recommendations in .",
  "Data Collection": "To collect our initial pool of papers, we implemented an automated, keyword-based approach usingthe Scholarly package , which retrieved approximately 5000 papers. Queries included terms like\"music,\" \"music generation,\" and \"symbolic music.\" This method allowed us to efficiently focus onrelevant research while avoiding manual errors. We refined the pool to 800 papers from elevenmajor conferences and organizations such as AAAI, ACM, ICASSP, NeurIPS, and ISMIR, chosen fortheir relevance and reputation.Dataset Papers From this refined pool, 152 papers proposing datasets were identified throughtitle and abstract reviews7. These datasets, collectively containing over one million hours of music,were annotated for region, genres, total hours, and additional metadata such as instruments orstyles. However, 7.9% of the datasets (totaling 5,772 hours) were excluded due to insufficient detailson genre or region. For large datasets with over 10,000 hours of audio, we analyzed sound filemetadata to extract this information where available.Research Papers To identify generative AI papers, we applied a second round of keywordfiltering (e.g., \"generative AI,\" \"transformers\") on titles and abstracts, resulting in 244 papers8. Thesewere annotated for genres and regions, with regional classification based on the first authorsinstitutional affiliation. For example, a paper authored by someone at a French institution was",
  "Omission of Global South from AI Music Generation5": "to only 2.1% of the collection. The other genres receive minimal attention ( 1%) which includesmusic for Children, Indie-music, and region-specific genres. We can see from the table in AppendixA.2 that Pop music forms 200K+ hours of the collection while Folk music constitutes only 20K hoursof the collection. 3.1.2Region-wise Distribution: presents a striking heatmap illustrating the imbalancein dataset representation, with the Global South marked in blue and the Global North in red. Ouranalysis reveals that more than 6,000 hours of music in the research dataset belong to Europeanmusic, whereas only 28 hours represent African music, as detailed in Appendix A.3. Music from theGlobal North is well represented, constituting 85.9% of the collection. In contrast, music from SouthAsia and the Middle East is underrepresented, each contributing approximately 5%. Furthermore,music from Central Asia and Africa each accounts for less than 1% of the entire collection, effectivelyrendering them unrepresented in the dataset. 3.1.3Instrument-wise Data Distribution in Backbone Models. Upon analyzing the datasetsused to train backbone models for evaluating music generation, we observed a strong emphasison global instruments such as guitar, drums, and piano compared to regional instruments. Fromtable in Appendix A.1 we can infer that guitar, piano, and drums commonly used in music fromthe Global North constitute 52.33% and 67.54% of the collection in the VGGish and PANN modelsrespectively. In contrast, instruments like sitar, tabla, clarinet, bagpipes, accordion, and bassooneach have less than 2% and 3% representation in the collection. This imbalance favours globallyprevalent instruments over regional ones, leading to skewed evaluations and inaccurate vectorspaces that misrepresent regional instruments and diverse musical styles.",
  "Representativeness of Research": "3.2.1Genre-wise Distribution: shows that Classical music is the most prominent genrein research, accounting for 36.5% of the total papers across various conferences in our collection.Electronic music, with a substantial 14.9%, and Pop, at 13.3%, follow as the next most studied genres.These genres likely benefit from a high volume of accessible data and established digital formats,making them more conducive for research. Conferences such as ICASSP and ISMIR have a strongrepresentation of Classical, Pop, and Electronic genres while NIME and AAAI showcase a diversegenre distribution, including Avant-garde & Experimental genres, indicating these venues someopenness to exploring other genres also. Genres like Jazz (6.7%), Rock (3.5%), and Folk (2.7%) receivemoderate attention, suggesting a valuable exploration of these genres in AI music. Country andEasy Listening are notably underrepresented in research, as seen by their minimal paper counts inmost conferences. 3.2.2Region-wise Distribution: highlights significant disparities in affiliations ofresearchers, underscoring the under-representation of the Global South. Approximately 88% ofresearch papers originate from researchers affiliated with institutions in the Global North, incontrast, only about 12% of the research papers feature contributions from researchers affiliatedwith institutions in the Global South. The table in Appendix A.3 shows that regions leading in termsof researcher affiliations are East Asia (84 papers), Europe (70 papers), and America (75 papers),likely due to the strong music industries there while Africa, Middle East, and South Asia collectivelyaccounts for only 2.4% of all researcher affiliations in our collection.",
  "To analyze the prevalence and popularity of musical genres (treated equivalently by us), we utilizeproxies from both digital and real-world domains. For the digital world, we use SoundCharts16": "and MusicBrainz17. For the real-world prevalence of a genre, we use the regions population asthe proxy . Further details on proxy estimation are present in Appendix B. This dualapproach enables us to estimate the digital footprint of genres alongside their offline listenerbase, facilitating a comparative analysis of music distribution across datasets, digital trends, andreal-world demographics to identify potential gaps and underlying factors. 3.3.1Comparison with Datasets & Research: Upon analyzing digital and real-world proxies,we found significant regional disparities. American music dominates digital consumption (150billion listeners), while European music leads research datasets (6,127.92 hours) despite havingonly 2.38 billion listeners. Conversely, South Asia and Africa are severely underrepresented in bothresearch (588.78 and 27.50 hours, respectively) and digital catalogs (671 and 945 songs, respectively),despite their large populations. East Asia shows moderate representation in research (2,817.73hours) but lags in digital catalogs (662 songs).The Global North disproportionately dominates music datasets, with a digital representationratio of 6.58 compared to 0.66 in the real world. Correlations between dataset duration and digitalproxies show weak alignment with regional viewership, with values of 0.35 (MusicBrainz) and -0.16(SoundCharts). However, there is a stronger correlation (0.65) between research dataset hours andMusicBrainz, indicating some alignment between digital music distribution and research focus.In genre representation, Hip-Hop dominates the digital space with 22,562 songs in MusicBrainzand significant viewership (> 50 billion views in SoundCharts) but contributes only 6% to researchdatasets. Electronic music, despite fewer songs (14,025), contributes 13.1%. Similarly, Classical musichas modest digital views (13.72 billion) but represents 13.5% of research. Genres like Folk, Blues, andJazz, while highly popular in digital spaces, are underrepresented in research, whereas Countryand Classical are well-represented in research despite limited digital popularity.Interestingly, research datasets align more closely with the digital space in genre-specific sce-narios, with Pearson correlations of 0.71 and 0.62 for dataset duration relative to MusicBrainz andSoundCharts, respectively. Well-represented genres like Rock, Pop, and Electronic exhibit strong align-ment across both spaces, while genres like Experimental, Hip-Hop, and Folk highlight a persistentgap between digital popularity and research focus.",
  "Omission of Global South from AI Music Generation7": "4Why Does it Matter?The under-representation of Global South music genres in AI-driven music generation poses aserious threat to cultural diversity. As AI becomes integral to the music industry, the rich andvibrant traditions of the Global Majority risk being eroded or extinct , leading to a homogenizedglobal music landscape. This section explores the implications of this marginalization and offersactionable recommendations to mitigate potential risks.",
  "Implications": "Colonization and technological progress have historically favored those who create and propagatethe technology, often at the expense of marginalized groups and their cultures . Lund critiques Western dominance in global pop narratives, showing how local genres in regions likeTurkey, Brazil, and Peru gain recognition only through Western attention, reshaping their valuedomestically. Similarly, Collins and Grierson warns that AI in music could reinforce this dynamic,monopolizing musical history and promoting select genres, metaphorically \"rewriting\" all musicwith \"Taylors Versions.\" Our analysis shows that genres from the Global South are underrepresentedin training datasets, limiting models ability to capture their richness and diversity. (1) Limiting Global South Creativity: The exclusion of Global South music genres from AItraining datasets limits the potential for these genres to evolve and adapt in the digital age. Bynot being part of the AI-driven creative process, these genres may miss out on opportunitiesto innovate and reach new audiences, potentially stagnating while other genres continue todevelop in exciting new directions. (2) Economic Disparities: Focus on Global North music in AI-generated content could furtherworsen the economic disparities within the music industry. Musicians from the Global South may find it even more challenging to gain recognition if their genres are not adequatelyrepresented, further increasing the economic divide between the Global North and South . (3) Reinforcement of Existing Biases: By focusing primarily on Global North music datasets, AI models may inadvertently reinforce existing cultural biases, perpetuating a cyclewhere Global South music is viewed as less important or less valuable. For instance, Longoria claims that the people of the Global South encounter barriers such as lack of representationin the music they study and in organizational leadership, alongside systemic bias. AI couldfurther marginalize musicians and composers from non-Western backgrounds. (4) Cultural Erosion: Genres like Hindustani folk, traditional Arabic Maqam, and others, arerepositories of centuries-old traditions, philosophies, and artistic expressions. If AI systemscontinue to prioritize Western music, these rich traditions could fade from the public mind,leading to cultural erosion.",
  "Recommendations": "The global musical landscape evolves through economic, technological, and social forces, alongsideefforts to amplify diversity and decolonize music studies Tan . In AI-generated music, fosteringinclusivity requires intentional actions. While egalitarian approach to genres is challenging , theresearch community can adopt strategies to better include diverse musical traditions: (1) Explicit Mention of Genres and Model Limitations: Music generation papers shouldexplicitly state the genres used for training and evaluation, akin to the Bender Rule in NLP, to ensure clarity and prevent misinterpretations. Additionally, they should acknowl-edge model limitations, such as symbolic musics inability to capture microtonal variations(e.g., Shrutis, Appendix A.4), encouraging improvements and highlighting underrepresentedgenres. (2) Avoid Generation When Uncertainty Exists: Even the most inclusive models maystruggle with under-represented or unrepresented genres. It is essential to issue warnings forthe former and avoid generating samples for the latter to ensure users understand potentialinaccuracies and prevent distortions in the digital music space. outlines the associatedissues, risks, and recommendations. (3) Investing on Inclusive Datasets: The Masakhane Project highlights the impact ofcommunity-driven efforts in building diverse, regional datasets. A similar approach in musicdata collection could address the underrepresentation of Global South genres. While genreslike Hip-Hop are digitally prominent, they are underrepresented in research , emphasizingthe need for diverse regional and genre coverage. Initiatives like Googles Inclusive ImagesCompetition demonstrate how AI models can be designed to generalize across culturaland geographic diversity, a principle applicable to music generation. (4) Transfer Learning for Underrepresented Styles: Similar to language research, wheretransfer learning aids low-resource languages , music research should exploresample-efficient cross-genre transfer for styles, instruments, and melodic structures . (5) Inclusive Evaluation: For most genres, model performance remains unclear due to insuf-ficient genre-specific evaluations or reporting. Studies like Xiong et al. and Yang andLerch emphasize the limitations of formative assessments and the need for subjectiveevaluation in AI-generated music. Additionally, as noted in .1.3, backbone modelsrequire fine-tuning on diverse music styles to avoid misrepresenting different styles. 5ConclusionThis article highlights an important gap in AI-driven music generation: the noticeable lack ofrepresentation of music genres from the Global South. While AI tools have made incredible progressin generating music, they overwhelmingly focus on genres from the Global North, leaving outmany unique and culturally rich styles from regions like Africa, Latin America, South Asia, and theMiddle East. This imbalance not only risks the erasure of many under-represented (in AI space)musical genres of the world but also limits the potential of AI to serve as a truly global creativetool.We also provided several recommendations that the AI-music research community could followto mitigate these risks. While many of the recommendations, such as transparency about genresand avoidance of generation when not confident, can be implemented by individuals and groups intheir research, several others will need community-level cooperation. This article is a call for suchlarge-scale community-level initiatives that can make a significant positive impact on the diversityand inclusion of AI music research.",
