  "Abstract": "Although capable of generating creative text, Large Language Models (LLMs) arepoor judges of what constitutes creativity. In this work, we show that we canleverage this knowledge of how to write creatively in order to better judge what iscreative. We take a mechanistic approach that extracts differences in the internalstates of an LLM when prompted to respond boringly or creatively to providea robust measure of creativity that corresponds strongly with human judgment. Wealso show these internal state differences can be applied to enhance the creativityof generated text at inference time.",
  "Introduction": "The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate the quality of their own outputs hasreceived significant attention recently [Xu et al., 2023] due to the widespread desire to make useof potential high-quality synthetic data. While it has been argued that LLMs are not good enoughat self-evaluation to bootstrap themselves into better reasoners [Huang et al., 2023] or forgo realdata entirely [Wang et al., 2023], there are scenarios where self-evaluation can enable improvedperformance [Ren et al., 2023, Yuan et al., 2024, Madaan et al., 2024]. In this work, we show thatLLM-based self-evaluation with respect to creativity is challenging if approached naively; with LLMsself-evaluations but by leveraging the internal representations of an LLM during inference, not onlycan self-assessment be improved, the creativity of the generation itself can be amplified. Recent work in steering language models has shown that LLMs represent concepts as linear directionsin their activation space [Turner et al., 2023]. Specific directions corresponding to social bias, refusal,harmlessness, or humor have been identified by prior work [Ratzlaff et al., 2024, Gao et al., 2024,Templeton et al., 2024]. Furthermore, it has been shown that its possible to remove, or ablatethese features from the model via an orthogonal projection of intermediate activations onto a chosendirection. In the case of refusal, a safety-tuned model can have its guardrails effectively removed[Arditi et al., 2024], allowing a user to prompt the model in ways that were previously censored.Conversely, it is also possible to induce a specific feature [Rimsky et al., 2023, Hinck et al., 2024],forcing the model to respond in a particular way according to the chosen direction. In this work weexplore model steering for creativity, and propose three steps to unlock an LLMs potential for use increative domains.",
  "arXiv:2412.06060v1 [cs.CL] 8 Dec 2024": "We apply our creative steering directions to induce (increase) the creativity of generationssampled from Llama3-8B on the creative writing dataset Fan et al. . Upon inspection,the generated samples are far more diverse and creative than baseline generations. We construct an estimator to score the creativity of generated output leverages the creativesteering directions. We find this estimator aligns closely with human judgment, unlikesimple prompting baselines.",
  "Method": "Our method has three main components: 1) finding a suitable creativity direction in activationspace, 2) optionally use this direction to steer the LLM to generate creative text, and 3) scoringthe creativity of outputs respect to this creativity direction. The established method of computing aparticular concept in activation space requires collecting a small dataset of contrastive instructions[Marks and Tegmark, 2023], where the only difference between the corresponding completions is thepresence or absence of the concept in question. In our case, we leveraged the creative writing promptsdataset [Fan et al., 2018] to elicit creative generations, and used GPT4o [Achiam et al., 2023] to craftuncreative versions of the same prompts to obtain paired creative-uncreative responses. We use thevalidation split of the creative writing prompts dataset for finding the attribute, and the test split inour evaluation experiments. Details and examples of the dataset can be found in the appendix. Givena set of paired creative instructions xc Xc and uncreative instructions xu Xu, we compute thecreative direction as the normalized difference in the average activation vectors at a given layer withrespect to the creative and uncreative instructions:",

The choice of layer is selected empirically; examplesof the resulting generations when different layers are targeted can be found in the appendix. In thiswork, we choose layer 8 of Llama3-8B [Dubey et al., 2024] as the target layer. At inference time, wecan score the creativity of generated text by computing the cosine similarity between the attribute aand the current token:",
  "where T is the total generated tokens, xt is the token generated at step t, and x0 is the input": ": Left: We prompted Llama3-8B and Llama3-70B to assign a rating (0-9) to generatedstories with respect to a baseline prompt with no creative intervention (Baseline), a baseline promptwith creative intervention (Induced), and a creative version of the baseline prompt (Creative). Errorbars are 95% confidence intervals. Center: We compute the cosine similarity to the creative attributeduring text generation on the test split of the uncreative prompts, uncreative prompts with creativityadded, and the creative prompts. We find the intermediate activations of the latter two are muchmore similar to the creativity attribute. Right: Self, Frontier Model, and Human assessment accuracyof predicting which completion is more creative, given a pair of induced and baseline generationsfinding the Llama3-8B model to be a poor self-judge of creativity. Finally, we can steer the LLM to induce increased creativity of generated text by adding the creativityattribute to the intermediate activations at the target layer. Intuitively, we are amplifying the contri-bution of the models internal sense of creativity. Note that in this case, the notion of creativity isheavily tied to creative writing and common subject matter therein, rather than a general notion ofcreativity. LLM l(x) = LLMl(x) + a, where LLM l(x) is effectively a replaced version of thelayer and the scalar = 3 was found manually from early tests.",
  "Experiments": "shows our three main experiments. First, we use Llama3-8B to generate 3 types of stories:creative story prompts from our dataset, non-creative prompts from GPT4o, and non-creative with thecreativity vector added. We find the models often score all stories similarly at about 7 (when askedto rate the story from 0 to 9). Next, we show our scoring method is highly effective at identifyingcreative stories. We compute the score on the test split of the creative / uncreative prompts, and wefind the creative stories (as well as uncreative stories with creativity induced) are much more similarto the creativity attribute. This result clearly indicates that the LLM internally models creativityand can accurately track how creative a given story is. Finally, to verify the efficacy of adding thediscovered creativity attribute, we run pairwise comparisons on the generations of the uncreativeprompts with and without creativity induced. We find the original model is a poor predictor of itsown creativity, whereas a large frontier model (Llama3-70b) is on par with a human annotator (withagreement > 70%). These results show that a naive approach to LLM self-assessment is not sufficientfor identifying creative output.",
  "AModel Details": "We used Llama3-8B as our model of interest, due to its well-rounded abilities in multiple subjects. Forself-evaluation experiments we used the same Llama3-8B model, and for frontier model evaluations,we used the larger Llama3-70B. All generation hyperparameters can be found in . Toensure that we strictly evaluated the effect of our steering method, we set hyperparameters likeTEMPERATURE and TOP_P to 1.0",

  "CContrastive Dataset Details": "It is critical to obtain high quality contrastive pairs of generations to isolate the creativity direction.For positively creative instructions we leverage the creative writing prompts dataset [Fan et al., 2018],randomly sampling 500 writing prompts to obtain creative generations. To obtain baseline, or lesscreative generations, we use GPT4o to negate the aspects of creativity in our creative instructions.",

  "DCreativity at Different Model Depths": "Model generation behavior can vary wildly when intervened on. We find that earlier layers can failto generate meaningful test when the residual stream is altered. Intervening near the final layers ofLlama3-8B has little effect on the output. We find that intervening near the middle of the networkyields a reasonable trade-off of generation quality and introduced creativity.",
