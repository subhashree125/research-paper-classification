  "Abstract": "This study examines the alignment of Confer-ence on Computer Vision and Pattern Recogni-tion (CVPR) research with the principles of the\"bitter lesson\" proposed by Rich Sutton. Weanalyze two decades of CVPR abstracts and ti-tles using large language models (LLMs) to as-sess the fields embracement of these principles.Our methodology leverages state-of-the-art nat-ural language processing techniques to system-atically evaluate the evolution of research ap-proaches in computer vision.

  "Introduction": "Rich Suttons influential essay \"The Bitter Lesson\"argues that the most significant advancements inartificial intelligence (AI) have come from focus-ing on general methods that leverage computationrather than human-designed representations andknowledge. This principle has been particularly ev-ident in the field of Computer Vision (CV), whichhas witnessed a notable shift from hand-craftedfeatures to deep learning models.In this paper, we investigate the extent to whichthe abstracts of the Conference on Computer Visionand Pattern Recognition (CVPR), a major machinelearning (ML) conference, align with the principlesof the \"bitter lesson\" over a span of 20 years. Weanalyze a random sample of 200 papers each year,addressing the following research questions:",
  "Is there a significant relationship between apapers alignment with the \"bitter lesson\" prin-ciples and its impact, as measured by citationcount?": "To address these questions, we employ largelanguage models (LLMs), which themselves are aprime manifestation of principles outlined in the\"bitter lesson\", to analyze the CVPR abstracts. Theevaluation is based on five metrics assigned by theLLMs, providing a comprehensive assessment ofthe alignment between the abstracts and the \"bitterlesson.\"Our research provides valuable insights into theoverall direction of the ML community and revealsinteresting trends in the adoption of Suttons princi-ples. By leveraging LLMs to analyze a large bodyof research literature, we offer a novel approachto understanding the learning and evolution of ascientific field. This method allows us to uncoverpatterns and trends that may not be immediatelyapparent through traditional research methods, pro-viding a more comprehensive understanding of thecurrent state of ML research and its alignment withthe principles that have proven most effective indriving progress in AI.The potential impact of our findings on futureCV research directions is significant. By identify-ing trends in the adoption of general methods anddeep learning techniques, we can inform the devel-opment of foundation models for CV at the state",
  "The Bitter Lesson": "The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has wit-nessed a paradigm shift, eloquently articulated inRich Suttons influential essay \"The Bitter Les-son\" (Sutton, 2019). Suttons thesis emphasizesthe primacy of general methods that harness com-putational power over human-designed represen-tations and domain-specific knowledge. This per-spective echoes the seminal work of Leo Breiman,who, two decades earlier, delineated the dichotomybetween statistical and algorithmic approaches inhis paper \"Statistical Modeling: The Two Cul-tures\" (Breiman, 2001). Breimans insights, alongwith subsequent works like (Halevy et al., 2009),have profoundly shaped our understanding of data-driven methodologies in AI.",
  "Evolution of Computer Vision": "The field of Computer Vision (CV) exemplifies theprinciples of Suttons \"bitter lesson.\" Traditionallyreliant on hand-crafted features like SIFT, HOG,and Haar cascades for object detection and im-age classification, CV underwent a paradigm shiftwith embracing deep learning, particularly Convo-lutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This transitionenabled the automatic learning of hierarchical fea-tures directly from raw image data, eliminating theneed for manual feature engineering and signifi-cantly improving performance across various CVtasks.The 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recog-nition Challenge (ILSVRC) marked a pivotal mo-ment in this evolution. AlexNet, a CNN architec-ture, achieved a remarkable 15.3% top-5 error rate,outperforming previous models by over 10 percent-age points. This breakthrough was facilitated bythe convergence of ImageNets massive annotateddataset, advancements in CNN architectures, GPUcomputing power, and foundational work of vision-ary researchers.The subsequent emergence of foundation modelsfurther aligned CV with Suttons principles. Mod-els like CLIP, ALIGN, and Florence demonstrateremarkable adaptability across diverse tasks withminimal fine-tuning, leveraging extensive multi- modal datasets to learn rich, transferable repre-sentations. For instance, the Florence model hasachieved state-of-the-art results by integrating uni-versal visual-language representations from web-scale image-text data (Bayoudh et al., 2021).This evolution from traditional feature engineer-ing to deep learning and foundation models in CVunderscores the importance of leveraging computa-tion and vast datasets for superior performance andgeneralization. For a comprehensive overview ofthese advancements, readers may refer to Minaeeet al. (2020), which details recent progress in deeplearning for image segmentation.",
  "Large Language Models in AcademicEvaluation": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs)into the evaluation of academic texts has emergedas a significant area of interest. LLMs, such asGPT-4, have demonstrated remarkable capabilitiesin processing and analyzing large volumes of infor-mation quickly, making them suitable for variousapplications, including the assessment of academicliterature. For instance, research has shown thatLLMs can effectively assist in title and abstractscreening for literature reviews, which is crucial inthe biomedical domain (Dennstdt, 2024). More-over, LLMs have been employed to perform qual-itative data analysis, producing consistent resultsacross multiple iterations (Tai et al., 2023).In addition to their analytical capabilities, LLMshave been shown to possess a degree of human-likejudgment in evaluating the quality of text. The G-EVAL framework, which utilizes LLMs to assessthe quality of natural language generation outputs,demonstrates that LLMs can align closely withhuman evaluators in certain contexts (Liu, 2023).However, the deployment of LLMs in academicevaluation is not without challenges. LLMs canexhibit biases similar to those found in human judg-ments, which may affect the fairness and accuracyof their evaluations (Acerbi, 2023). Furthermore,the phenomenon of \"hallucination,\" where LLMsproduce plausible but factually incorrect informa-tion, poses a risk in academic contexts (Buchanan,2023).The role of LLMs in answering questions andgenerating hypotheses also merits attention. Theirability to provide detailed responses to complexqueries has been leveraged in various educationalsettings, enhancing learning experiences and fa- cilitating knowledge acquisition (Polverini, 2024).However, the tendency of LLMs to produce ver-bose outputs can sometimes obscure the clarity oftheir answers, necessitating careful prompt engi-neering (Yeadon, 2024). In the context of academicresearch, LLMs can assist in generating hypothesesand guiding exploratory studies, contributing to theadvancement of knowledge in various fields (Ironset al., 2023).Despite the promising applications of LLMs inacademic evaluation and research, it is crucial to es-tablish ethical guidelines and best practices for theiruse. The potential for misuse, such as generatingmisleading information or facilitating academic dis-honesty, necessitates careful consideration of theimplications of LLM deployment in educationaland research contexts (Urman, 2023).",
  "LLM Evaluation of Titles and Abstracts": "We employ three large language models to evaluatethe title and abstracts of CVPR papers from 2005to 2024: GPT-4o-2024-05-13, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, and claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620. The fol-lowing information is extracted from online portalsand stored in a database for each paper: Publi-cation year (2005-2024), Title, Authors, Abstract.For each paper, the citation count from SemanticScholar API is also queried on July 20th 2024, andstored alongside the other metadata. The total num-ber of papers per year is shown in .Each LLM model is tasked with assigning a Lik-ert score of 0-10 for how well the paper aligns withthe principles of Suttons \"bitter lesson.\" We usethe Chain-of-Thought Prompting technique withMagentic library to interface with the models andcollect their responses in a structured format foranalysis (Collins et al., 2024). The prompts usedin this study are included in the appendix for repro-ducibility.We define five dimensions for \"bitter lesson\"alignment: 1. Learning Over Engineering: To what ex-tent does the idea prioritize leveraging com-putation through data-driven learning andstatistical methods over relying on human-engineered knowledge, heuristics, and domainexpertise?",
  ". Scalability with Computation: To what ex-tent is the idea based on methods that cancontinuously scale and improve performanceas the available computational resources in-crease?": "4. Generality over Specificity: To what degreedoes the approach emphasize general, flexi-ble, and adaptable methods that can learn andcapture arbitrary complexity from data ratherthan attempting to build in complex and de-tailed models of the world through manualengineering and domain-specific knowledge? 5. Favoring Fundamental Principles: To whatextent does the approach adhere to fundamen-tal principles of computation, mathematics,and information theory rather than focusingon emulating the specific details of humancognition or biological intelligence? The prompts were designed to capture theessence of each \"bitter lesson\" dimension conciselyand objectively. To anchor the ratings, we provideexamples for the 0, 5, and 10 points on each dimen-sion, clarifying the criteria and ensuring consistentevaluations. The prompts are formatted consis-tently to facilitate easy processing and understand-ing by the models.Given the vast number of publications, our studyfocuses on a representative random sample of 200papers from each year of CVPR proceedings. Wedefine the overall alignment score for each paperas the sum of scores across five dimensions. Inthe absence of human-evaluated ground truth, weemploy multiple inter-rater reliability measures toassess the consistency of ratings between differentmodels.",
  "Regression Analysis": "presents the results of the regression analy-sis for each dimension of \"bitter lesson\" alignmentscores against citation impact, stratified by year ofpublication. The R-squared values, ranging from0.027 to 0.306, indicate that 2.7-30.6% of the vari-ation in citation impact can be explained by align-ment to \"bitter lessons\" dimensions. It is crucial to",
  "Inter-rater Reliability": "presents the inter-rater reliability scoresfor the five dimensions of \"bitter lesson\" alignmentacross the three models employed in this study. Thehorizontal dashed lines indicate common thresh-olds for interpreting these measures, with the colorand label denoting the qualitative interpretation.The bar colors reflect the relative strength of eachdimension. In the Krippendorffs alpha graph, thebar for the \"Favoring Fundamental Principles\" di-mension is not visible due to its near-zero score.The models demonstrate consistently strongagreement on all dimensions except \"Favoring Fun-damental Principles,\" as evidenced by ICC valuesabove 0.5 and Krippendorffs alpha scores exceed-ing 0.4 on the remaining dimensions. The poor per-formance on \"Favoring Fundamental Principles\"may be attributed to the high adherence to this prin-ciple in papers published since 2005. Among thedimensions, \"Learning Over Engineering\" exhibitsthe highest ICC and Krippendorffs alpha scores,indicating the models reliable evaluation of pa-per alignment based on the provided prompts andrating criteria.Although perfect agreement is not achieved, theinter-reliability measures fall within or above com-mon thresholds for \"good\" reliability, validating",
  ":Distribution of citation counts and log-transformed citation counts for CVPR papers from 2005to 2024 present in the database": "the use of AI models for prompt-based researchpaper evaluation. It is important to acknowledgethat even with domain expert human raters, perfectagreement is seldom attained due to the complex-ities of research evaluation. The high reliabilityscores obtained in this study demonstrate the mod-els consistency in their assessments, providing areliable foundation for further analysis.

  "interpret the coefficients for each dimension as mul-tiplicative effects, as the log transform of citationcounts is used as the dependent variable": "In the context of this regression analysis, a multi-plicative effect implies that a one-unit change in thealignment score for a particular dimension leadsto a proportional change in the original scale ofthe citation count. For instance, if the regressioncoefficient for the \"Scalability\" dimension is 0.5,a one-unit increase in the \"Scalability\" alignmentscore would be associated with a multiplicativeeffect of approximately exp(0.5) 1.65 on theoriginal citation count. In other words, if a papers\"Scalability\" alignment score increases by one unit,its citation count would be expected to increase by afactor of 1.65, holding all other variables constant. The statistical significance of the regression co-efficients is denoted using *, **, and *** to rep-resent the 10%, 5%, and 1% significance levels,respectively. Several dimensions, such as \"Scal-ability\" and \"Learning over engineering,\" exhibitstatistically significant relationships with citationimpact across multiple years. However, given thehigh degree of correlation between the dimensions,the significance and coefficients in the regressionmodel should be interpreted with caution. These findings suggest that adherence to the prin-ciples outlined in the \"bitter lesson\" dimensions,particularly \"Scalability\" and \"Learning over engi-neering,\" may have a positive influence on a paperscitation impact. The multiplicative nature of thecoefficients highlights the potential for substantialincreases in citation counts as alignment scores im-prove. Nevertheless, the presence of correlationsamong the dimensions necessitates a cautious in-terpretation of the individual coefficients and theirstatistical significance. shows the results of regressing citationcounts on the overall \"bitter lesson\" alignmentscore for each year between 2005 and 2024. Sev-eral key trends emerge. First, the R-squared values,which indicate the proportion of variance in cita-tion counts explained by the alignment scores, arequite low for most years (generally less than 5%).However, they increase substantially starting in2015, reaching over 15% in some later years. Thissuggests that alignment with the \"bitter lessons\"became more predictive of citation impact overtime. This time period is of special interest asit coincides with the emergence of deep learning,and a shift towards the principles of scalability and",
  "*** indicates significance at the 1% level, ** indicates significance at the 5% level, and * indicates significance at the 10% level": "learning from data that are emphasized in the \"bit-ter lessons.\" Second, the overall alignment scoresexhibit a statistically significant positive relation-ship with citations in many individual years, mostprominently after 2011. The coefficients tend tobe largest in later years as well. This indicates thatas deep learning became more established, papersmore closely adhering to principles like scalabil-ity and learning from data received more citations on average. The results suggest that the \"bitterlessons\" have become increasingly important in thefield of computer vision, aligning with the broadertrend towards data-driven methods and scalablealgorithms in machine learning research.",
  ": Line plot showing the average alignment scores across years for CVPR papers from 2005 to 2024": "2005-2024. The vertical lines, which depict thepublication of influential papers in machine learn-ing (not necessarily computer vision), serve as aguide to understanding the overall evolution of thefield. The averages are calculated across all pa- pers and all language models (LLMs) employed inthe study. The plot reveals several notable trendsin the alignment of CVPR papers with the princi-ples of the \"bitter lesson.\" Notably, the dimensionsof \"Scalability with Computation\" and \"Learning Over Engineering\" exhibit a consistent upwardtrend over the years, indicating a growing empha-sis on scalable algorithms and data-driven learningmethods in CVPR research. This trend aligns withthe broader shift towards deep learning and foun-dation models in computer vision, emphasizing theimportance of leveraging computation and largedatasets for superior performance.The period from 2015 to 2020 witnesses a partic-ularly sharp rise in the average scores for these di-mensions, coinciding with major advances in deeplearning, such as the application of convolutionalneural networks to computer vision tasks. Inter-estingly, this time frame corresponds to the periodin which the regression analysis finds the highestpredictive power of alignment scores on citationcounts. This finding suggests that the increasingalignment of CVPR papers with the principles ofscalability and learning-oriented approaches dur-ing this period has a significant impact on theiracademic influence, as measured by citation met-rics.The observed trends in the alignment scores high-light the evolving landscape of computer visionresearch, with a growing emphasis on leveragingthe power of computation and data-driven learningtechniques. The coincidence of these trends withthe increased predictive power of alignment scoreson citation counts underscores the importance ofadhering to the principles of the \"bitter lesson\" forachieving impactful research outcomes in the fieldof computer vision.",
  "Conclusion": "Our study examined the alignment of CVPR re-search with Rich Suttons \"The Bitter Lesson\" overtwenty years, leveraging large language modelsto analyze trends. The findings reveal a consis-tent increase in the adoption of general-purposelearning algorithms and scalability with computa-tional resources, reflecting a strong adherence tothe core principles of the \"bitter lesson.\" Thesetrends underscore the machine learning commu-nitys preference for data-driven and computation-heavy approaches over manual engineering anddomain-specific knowledge.However, the dimension of \"Search over Heuris-tics\" has not experienced a similar upward trajec-tory, indicating limited integration of search-basedmethodologies within the field. This stagnationcontrasts with recent advancements in inference- time scaling, exemplified by OpenAIs o1 models,which emphasize the importance of test-time com-pute in overcoming diminishing returns. The o1models ability to simulate various strategies andscenarios during inference, similar to AlphaGosMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), marks a key de-parture from earlier approaches that relied heavilyon large pre-trained models.The paradigm shift towards scaling inferencetime, driven by the development of larger andmore complex models, has the potential to emu-late search-like processes. As computational capa-bilities continue to expand, it is plausible that fu-ture research may increasingly incorporate searchtechniques, thereby enhancing alignment with thisdimension of the \"bitter lesson.\" The dynamic re-source allocation in o1 models, which adjusts com-putational resources based on task complexity, fur-ther underscores the potential for integrating searchmethodologies.Overall, our findings highlight the continued rel-evance of the \"bitter lesson\" in shaping the tra-jectory of computer vision research. By empha-sizing generality and scalability, the field is well-positioned to leverage emerging computational ad-vancements. Future work should explore the inte-gration of search methodologies and assess their im-pact on research impact and innovation within com-puter vision, particularly in light of recent break-throughs in inference-time scaling.",
  "Limitations": "This study, while providing valuable insights intothe evolution of computer vision research, hasseveral limitations that should be acknowledged.Firstly, our reliance on large language models(LLMs) for evaluating research abstracts, whileinnovative, introduces potential biases inherent tothese models. The LLMs understanding and inter-pretation of complex scientific concepts may not al-ways align perfectly with human expert judgment.Secondly, the absence of human expert evalu-ation as a ground truth is a significant limitation.Collecting such human evaluations presents con-siderable challenges, as it would require a diversepanel of researchers from various subfields of thecomputer vision community. The interdisciplinarynature of modern computer vision research neces-sitates expertise in areas ranging from traditionalimage processing to deep learning, computer graph-ics, and even cognitive science. Assembling such a panel and achieving consensus on the evaluationcriteria would be a formidable task, both in termsof logistics and resources.Furthermore, our analysis is limited to the in-formation contained in titles and abstracts. Whilethese elements provide a concise summary of re-search, they may not capture the full depth andnuance of the methodologies and findings pre-sented in the full papers. This limitation couldpotentially lead to oversimplification of complexresearch ideas.Lastly, while our study spans two decades ofCVPR proceedings, it does not account for researchpublished in other venues or unpublished work thatmay have influenced the field. This focus on asingle conference, albeit a prestigious one, may notprovide a complete picture of the entire computervision research landscape.Despite these limitations, we believe our studyprovides valuable insights into broad trends in com-puter vision research and its alignment with theprinciples of the \"bitter lesson.\" Future work couldaddress these limitations by incorporating humanexpert evaluations, analyzing full paper contents,and expanding the scope to include a wider rangeof publication venues.",

We acknowledge that LLMsmay introduce biases when used for direct evalu-ation of academic work. However, our study fo-cuses solely on using LLMs to analyze broad trendsrather than to assess individual papers quality ormerit. We have addressed the challenges and poten-tial biases of LLM use for evaluation in our back-ground section, emphasizing the need for carefulinterpretation of results.All data were collected in accordance with appli-cable privacy and intellectual property laws.

Citation counts were collected from SemanticScholar, which also permits such collection andanalysis under its standard terms of use. No per-sonally identifiable information was collected fromhuman subjects.Our methodology aims to minimize risks by us- ing multiple models and focusing on aggregatetrends rather than individual assessments.Nocrowd workers or annotators were involved in thedata collection process described in the paper.
