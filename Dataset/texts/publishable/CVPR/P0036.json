  "Abstract": "The insufficient supervision limit the performance of thedeep supervised models for brain disease diagnosis. It isimportant to develop a learning framework that can capturemore information in limited data and insufficient supervi-sion. To address these issues at some extend, we propose amulti-stage graph learning framework which incorporates1) pretrain stage : self-supervised graph learning on insuf-ficient supervision of the fmri data 2) fine-tune stage : su-pervised graph learning for brain disorder diagnosis. Ex-periment results on three datasets, Autism Brain ImagingData Exchange ABIDE I, ABIDE II and ADHD with AAL1,demonstrating the superiority and generalizability of theproposed framework compared to the state of art of models.(ranging from 0.7330 to 0.9321,0.7209 to 0.9021,0.6338 to0.6699)",
  ". Introduction": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental dis-order characterized by significant social, communication,and behavioral challenges .Recent data from theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention ( indicate that one in 36 children is di-agnosed with autism. However, current diagnostic methodsheavily rely on traditional behavioral assessments, whichare subjective and can often result in missed early symp-toms and misdiagnoses. Consequently, there is a growinginterest in identifying objective biomarkers for early diag-nosis and timely intervention in ASD treatment within thefields of psychiatry and neuroscience .Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a techniquethat measures blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) sig-nals in the brain without requiring the subject to performspecific tasks. This technique has been widely employedto identify potential neuroimaging biomarkers for various",
  "*Guangzhou Women and Childrens Medical CenterSouth China Normal UniversityGuangzhou Women and Childrens Medical CenterGuangzhou Women and Childrens Medical CenterGiant Network AI Lab": "psychiatric disorders .Functional connectivity net-works (FCNs) are constructed to represent each subject,with each element indicating the pairwise relationships be-tween brain regions of interest (ROIs). FCNs help us under-stand brain organization patterns and diagnose psychiatricdisorders such as ASD , attention-deficit/hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD) depressive disorders , bipolardisorder , and anxiety disorders . However, pre-vious studies typically extract handcrafted network features(such as node degree and clustering coefficient) from FCNsand then use these features in prediction models for ASDdiagnosis.This approach limits diagnostic accuracy andheavily depends on expert knowledge.",
  ". Graph Network for fMRI": "As graph convolutional network (GCN) can well han-dle irregular graph structures with the graph convolution topropagate features of adjacent vertexes , GCN basedmodels have achieved greater successes in learning FCNfeature representation (namely FCN embedding), and con-sequently have improved the diagnostic performance forbrain diseases . A systematic study of GCN-basedbrain network analysis with models, examples and out-of-box Python package has been presented . For instance, aSiamese GCN model was proposed to learn a graph similar-ity metric between FCNs for distinguishing autism patientsfrom healthy controls . Another study investigated agraph embedding learning (GEL) model for diagnosing ma-jor depressive disorder by learning FCN embeddings viaGCN and then using a fully connected layer activated bya soft-max function for final classification . However,the above GNN network is designed for a single trainingstage and produce low accuracy, therefore, we proposed themulti-stage graph for fMRI analysis.",
  ". Methods": "As illustrated in , Multi-Stage Graph comprisestwo primary modules: a self-supervised learning with acontrastive learning adversarial strategy hypergraph (Multi-Stage Graph pre-training) and a graph classification model(fine-tuning). The Multi-Stage Graph pre-training involvescreating an original hypergraph and its edge-dropped ver-sion for contrastive learning and feature distillation. Duringcontrastive learning, the model distinguishes between thesetwo versions, using a trainable Bernoulli mask to randomlydrop edges, thus encouraging the learning of invariant fea-tures. The distilled features, robust to graph variations, arecrucial for disease diagnosis. The remaining edge weightsafter training can be analyzed as potential biomarkers. Inthe fine-tuning stage, these distilled features are classifiedusing a linear classifier trained to differentiate between ASDand NC subjects based on connectivity patterns and func-tional relationships within the brain.",
  ". Pre-training Stage": "In this stage, to train the feature extractor and the pa-rameters in the graph augmentation process, we use a lossfunction that forces the two feature vectors to be close ifthey are from the same graph and far away if they are fromdifferent graphs. In this way, the trained feature extractorcan keep the most important information while removingexcessive information in the graph. Since the training pro-ceeds in a batch-wise manner, such a loss is also imposedbatch-wisely. Specifically, the loss is defined by the info-Max principle (R Devon Hjelm et al., 2018) which we aimto maximize:",
  ". Fine-tuning stage": "In this stage, with the signal representation learningmodule and the pretrained topology-aware encoder, thenode embeddings learned from both the graph structure andBOLD signals can be utilized in the downstream graph clas-sification task. First, we fuse the two sets of node embed-dings using a simple summation. Then, a 1D convolutionallayer is employed to convert the fused node embeddingsinto the final graph representation. Finally, a multi-layerperceptron (MLP) is used to predict the class of the inputgraphs. The hypergraph classification model is fine-tunedusing cross-entropy loss to optimize the classification per-formance.",
  ". Experimental setup": "Our model is implemented in PyTorch. All of the algo-rithms described in this paper can be executed on a singleGPU. The experiments are accelerated by two servers withtwo NVIDIA V-100 GPUs. The implementation details areas follows: The learning rate is set to 0.001. The hyper-graph embedded dimension d is set to 32. The batch sizeis 32. The temperature i is set to 1. When applying theproposed model to a new fMRI dataset, it is recommendedto search the batch size in {8, 16, 32, 64}.",
  ". Evaluation": "We compared the performance of different methods onthe ABIDE I, ABIDE II, and ADHD datasets, includ-ing DGCN, GATE, A-GCL, and our proposed Multi-StageGraph. shows the accuracy (ACC) and area underthe curve (AUC) for each method on these datasets. Onthe ABIDE I dataset, the ACCs of the DGCN, GATE, andA-GCL methods were 0.7330, 0.7352, and 0.8065, respec-tively, with corresponding AUCs of 0.7415, 0.7560, and . Illustration of the proposed Multi-Stage Graph. The model can be divided into a hypergraph autoencoder (pre-training) and ahypergraph classification model (fine-tuning). (1) We propose a hypergraph autoencoder which consists of three stages: edge embeddinglearning and graph embedding learning. Multi-Stage Graph performs contrastive learning on features extracted from the original hyper-graph and its edge-dropped version based on a Bernoulli mask, enabling the learned features to be independent of the class labels andgenuinely represent an embedding of the graphs in Euclidean space. (2) The pre-trained hypergraph autoencoder and fMRI BOLD signalsare then combined to obtain the final graph embedding and diagnose results under the supervision of the class labels.",
  "an AUC of 0.9318. On the ABIDE II dataset, the ACCsof the DGCN, GATE, and A-GCL methods were 0.7258,": "0.7209, and 0.7988, respectively, with corresponding AUCsof 0.7327, 0.7406, and 0.8004.Our Multi-Stage Graphmethod also performed excellently, with an ACC of 0.9021and an AUC of 0.9408. On the ADHD dataset, the ACCsof the DGCN, GATE, and A-GCL methods were 0.6338,0.6526, and 0.7092, respectively, with corresponding AUCsof 0.6504, 0.6572, and 0.7112. Although the ACC of ourMulti-Stage Graph method was 0.6699, slightly lower thanA-GCL, its AUC was 0.6449, demonstrating stable perfor-mance compared to other methods. The proposed Multi-Stage Graph method significantly outperformed other meth-ods on the ABIDE I and ABIDE II datasets and showedcompetitive performance on the ADHD dataset, validatingthe effectiveness and robustness of our method in brain net-work analysis.",
  ". Ablations Study for ABIDE I , ABIDE II andADHD": "presents the ablation study results for the ABIDEI, ABIDE II, and ADHD datasets, comparing the per-formance of the One-Stage-Graph and Multi-Stage-Graphmethods.The results are reported in terms of accuracy(ACC) and area under the curve (AUC). For the ABIDE Idataset, the One-Stage-Graph method achieved an ACC of0.8510 and an AUC of 0.8509. In contrast, the Multi-Stage-Graph method significantly improved the performance, withan ACC of 0.9321 and an AUC of 0.9318. This demon-strates the effectiveness of the multi-stage approach in cap-turing complex interactions in brain networks. Similarly,on the ABIDE II dataset, the One-Stage-Graph method ob-tained an ACC of 0.7255 and an AUC of 0.7281, whereasthe Multi-Stage-Graph method substantially outperformedit with an ACC of 0.9021 and an AUC of 0.9408. Thissubstantial improvement underscores the robustness of themulti-stage strategy in handling diverse and challengingdatasets. In the case of the ADHD dataset, the One-Stage-Graph method achieved an ACC of 0.6409 and an AUCof 0.6416. The Multi-Stage-Graph method again showedbetter performance with an ACC of 0.6699 and an AUCof 0.6449. Although the improvement is relatively smallercompared to the ABIDE datasets, it still indicates the ad-vantage of the multi-stage method in extracting meaningfulfeatures even in more difficult classification tasks. Overall,the Multi-Stage-Graph method consistently outperformedthe One-Stage-Graph method across all datasets, validatingthe proposed multi-stage frameworks superiority in brainnetwork analysis.",
  ". Model Interpretability": "The important brain connections. For edge features, weperformed a transpose averaging operation on the gradientof edge features in the ASD group to create a saliency mapwith symmetric edges. Positive gradients indicate increased edge features in ASD compared to TD, while negative gra-dients indicate decreased features. We selected the top 66connections (top1%) with the highest absolute values froma total of 6670 (0.5 116 115) connections. These areshown in Figure. 2(a). Figure. 2(b) shows the distributionof these connections on the cortical surface. Red lines high-light connections with increased strength in ASD, whileblue lines highlight those with decreased strength. In theABIDE I dataset, the positive connections mainly link re-gions such as the SFG, SFGmed, ORBsupmed, and OLF,with the parietal cortex, cerebellum, and thalamus. Nega-tive connections primarily link the orbitofrontal cortex andMFG with the cerebellum, temporal cortex, and limbic sys-tem (PHG and AMYG). In the ABIDE II dataset, the con-nections are more dispersed, with most showing increasedstrength (Figure.3). For ALFF features, using the node saliency map of theASD group defined in , we identified the top 15 nodeswith the highest absolute values from a total of 348 (1163)nodes. Positive gradients in the node saliency map repre-sent increased node features in ASD, while negative gradi-ents represent decreased features. Figure.2 show the corti-cal surface locations of the increased(Left) and decreasednode features(Right) in ASD compared to TD, respectively.We further analyze the significant brain regions associatedwith ASD using Multi-Stage Graph. The importance of abrain region is quantified by the summed functional connec-tivitys (FCs) of a node in the edge-dropped graph. For eachdataset, we calculate this importance score for each brain re-gion, sort the scores, and select the top 15 most importantregions. The results are visualized using BrainNet-Viewer(www.nitrc.org) and displayed in . As shown in, for the ABIDE I dataset, the most important regionsfor ASD classification include the cerebellum, bilateralPHG.R, PCUN.R, bilateral CUN, ACG.L, MFG.R, PCL.L,SFGmed.R, and ORBsup.R. For the ABIDE II dataset, themost important regions are the cerebellum, bilateral MFG,bilateral CUN, bilateral PCUN, SOG.R, SFGdor.L, ACG.R,bilateral PoCG, DCG.R, and SFGmed.R. Notably, some re-gions such as SFGmed, CUN, PCUN, and ACG are iden-tified in both datasets and have been reported in previousstudies . SFGmed.L and SFGmed.R are thetwo regions with the highest node degree and the connec-tions are all the positive connection. The med SFG is in-volved in higher-order social cognitive processes such asunderstanding others intentions and emotions. The interpretation of the model. We found that ASDpatients showed decreased FC in the key nodes of the de-fault mode network (DMN) , such as the medial pre-frontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex (mPFC/ACC) andprecuneus in both datasets, and the bilateral parahippocam-pal gyri in ABIDE I.

Decreasednodal centralities , local and long-range connectivityin these regions during resting state, have been reportedin adolescents and adults with ASD. In line with the resting-state results, previous structural and task-related functionalMR studies also found that ASD patients showed morpho-logic abnormalities in the mPFC/ACC ,precuneus , parahippocampal gyrus , and less activation in themPFC on self-relevant social reward task . Therefore,our model supported the edge features of the DMN as a use-ful biomarker for the diagnosis of ASD.Our results also identified aberrant edge feature in thecuneus/calcarine fissure and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex(DLPFC) in ASD compared to TD group in both datasets.Meta-analysis had revealed that autistic people showed lessprefrontal activity during perception tasks and greater re-cruitment of extrastriate cortex during visual processing. The cuneus is implicated in visual processing andretrieval of autobiographical memories . Connectingwith other regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex, thala- mus, and the neocortex (including posterior temporal, pari-etal, and occipital areas), the DLPFC is involved in goal-directed thought and action (Cole and Schneider 2007),and is linked to the non-social abnormality of ASD ,such as restricted and repetitive behaviors, or reducing self-referential thoughts. Consequently, the DLPFC has beenused as a target region of transcranial current or mag-netic stimulation for the treatment of ASD. The cere-bellum is also a key node in motor learning, languagecomprehension, social skill, visual-spatial performance andmemory functions , which overlap with the aberrant do-mains observed among individuals with ASD. It has beenpointed out that cerebellar areas have reduced structural orfunctional connectivity to the dorsolateral and medial pre-frontal cortex , which is related to the social deficitsand increased repetitive behaviors in ASD mouse modelsand individuals with ASD . Both of the functional con-nectivity and ALFF features of the cerebellum contribute tothe diagnosing model, indicating that the cerebellar functionis more vulnerable in ASD.

  ". Discussion": "In this paper, we introduced a Multi-Stage Graphframework to extract FCN and ALFF embeddings, wherehyperedge-aware self-supervised learning with a contrastivelearning adversarial strategy in the pretraining stage was de-veloped to capture complex information in brain network.In the funetuning stage, The graph embeddings learnedfrom pretraining stage can be fine tuned for the downstreamgraph classification task. Finally, experimental results onthe ABIDE demonstrated the superiority of our method overseveral comparable ones for ASD/HC classification. Fur-thermore, our method is interpretable and we successfullydiscovered ASD-relevant ROIs that have been previouslyreported in the literature. We are going to improve perfor-mance of three datasets (ABIDE I ,ABIDE II and ADHD)further with the support of the brain foundation model in thefuture.
