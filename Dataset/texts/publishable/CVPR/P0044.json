  "Abstract": "In this work, we propose a fashion item recommendationmodel that incorporates hyperbolic geometry into user anditem representations. Using hyperbolic space, our modelaims to capture implicit hierarchies among items based ontheir visual data and users purchase history. During train-ing, we apply a multi-task learning framework that con-siders both hyperbolic and Euclidean distances in the lossfunction.Our experiments on three data sets show thatour model performs better than previous models trained inEuclidean space only, confirming the effectiveness of ourmodel. Our ablation studies show that multi-task learningplays a key role, and removing the Euclidean loss substan-tially deteriorates the model performance.1",
  ". Introduction": "In hyperbolic space, the distance from the origin in-creases exponentially as one moves towards the outside ofthe space. This property makes it well-suited for model-ing hierarchical data by representing the root node aroundthe origin and leaf nodes near the surface of the space. Inpractice, hyperbolic space has been used to represent var-ious types of instances that potentially possess hierarchi-cal structures, such as sentences and words , ques-tions and answers , and objects and scenes . Incomputer vision, its effectiveness has been confirmed onmany tasks , including classification , re-trieval , segmentation , and genera-tion .In this paper, we propose a new fashion item recommen-dation model that incorporates hyperbolic geometry intouser and item representations; we name it Hyperbolic Vi-sual Attentive Collaborative Filtering (HVACF). Using hy-perbolic space, our model aims to capture implicit hierar-chies among fashion items based on their image data andusers purchase history. To train our model, we apply a",
  ". Overview of our proposed model": "multi-task learning framework that combines the hyperbolicdistance with the Euclidean one, which was found effec-tive in previous studies for training recommender systemswithout visual features and also for learning representationsof objects and scenes . Our experiments show thatour model outperforms existing models trained in Euclideanspace only, confirming the effectiveness of our model. Wealso conduct ablation studies and find that multi-task learn-ing plays a key role, and removing the Euclidean loss re-sults in poor performance, even worse than baseline systemswithout visual features. This result suggests that multi-tasklearning is crucial for training fashion item recommendersystems, in contrast to the previous findings on recommen-dation tasks without visual features that hyperbolic modelsperform better than the Euclidean counterparts .",
  ". Recommender Systems in Hyperbolic Space": "Hyperbolic geometry differs from Euclidean geometryin that it measures distances on curves rather than straightlines.In hyperbolic space, the distance from the originincreases exponentially as one moves towards the surfaceof the space.This property is well-suited for modelinghierarchies and has been used for representation learningon various tasks . Previouswork also showed that it is effective in capturing the com-plex interactions between items and user preferences in rec-ommender systems . For instance, Tranet al. proposed a method based on hyperbolic space,called Hyperbolic Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR),and Benjamin et al. extended this model using large-scale data. Lucas et al. proposed Hyperbolic MetricLearning (HML), which incorporates the hyperbolic dis-tance into metric-learning models . Other studiesproposed recommendation models that incorporate hyper-bolic geometry into graph-based methods ;temporal point process ; or autoencoders . How-ever, to the best of our knowledge, hyperbolic space has notbeen used on recommendation tasks where the visual dataof items provides critical information, such as fashion itemrecommendation.",
  ". Training a Model in Hyperbolic Space": "Among several isometric models for modeling hyper-bolic space, this paper adopts the Poincare ball model, oneof the most common models in computer vision . In this paper, the induced geodesic distance be-tween x and y in hyperbolic space Dnc := {x, y Rn :cx2, cy2 < 1} for c 0 is defined as follows:",
  ". Neighbor-Attentive Aggregation": "Our proposed model extracts user preferences based ontheir purchase history and image data of each item. Here,U = {[u1; ...; un; ...; uNu]|un RD} RNuD denotesthe user embeddings, and V = {[v1; ...; vn; ...; vNv]|vn RD} RNvD and P = {[p1; ...; pn; ...; pNv]|pn RD} RNvD denote separate embeddings associatedwith the items. Nu and Nv are the numbers of users anditems, respectively; D is the embedding dimension; and[a; b] denotes the concatenation operation between the vec-tors a and b.First, we calculate the embedding ui that combines thei-th user embedding and item embeddings purchased by theuser, inspired by , as follows:",
  "where is a scaling factor (the larger the value is, thesharper the attention score becomes), which we set =": "D, and (x) = max(0, x) is the ReLU function. E() is apre-trained backbone encoder model and Il is the l-th itemsimage data. Wu, Wv, Wp RDD, and Wf RDDpooldenote transformation matrices for the users, items, anditem visual features extracted by the image encoder, respec-tively (Dpool is dimension size of the final pooling layer inthe backbone model); b1 RD is the bias vector of the firstlayer; and w2 RD and b2 R are the weighting vectorand bias of the second layer.",
  ". Performance with different hyperparameters": "set is chronologically sorted and then divided into the train,validation, and test sets with a ratio of 7:1:2, respectively.Besides, the ten previous models listed in plus arandom recommendation model are used for our baselines.These baselines are chosen from the visually-aware rec-ommendation models listed in and the hyperbolicrecommender systems listed in . The area under theROC curve (AUC) is used for evaluation, following previ-ous work .",
  ". User and item 2D-representations compressed by tSNE on Amazon Women": "to 512 for all models.We tune the learning rate r {0.01, 0.001, 0.0001} and the hyperparameter for regular-ization {0.1, 0.01, 0.001} for each model based on theperformance on the validation set. Inception V3 is usedas the backbone image encoder model for all models withvisual features, and its parameters are freezed during train-ing. For HVACF, we set = 0.5, c = 1.0, L = 32, andm = 0.5 based on the performance on the validation set.We repeat each experiment three times with different ran-dom seeds, and report the mean and standard deviation val-ues.",
  ". Ablation Studies": "We perform ablation studies and summarizesthe results.It shows that each component of our pro-posed model is indispensable to achieve high accuracy. No-tably, the performance of w/o Ladj is lower than that ofdc() deuc(): a model trained in Euclidean space only.The model w/o Ladj even underperforms baselines with-out visual features. These results indicate the importanceof considering both Euclidean and hyperbolic distances totrain fashion item recommendation models.",
  ". Impacts of Hyperparameters": "a and 2b illustrate how the hyperparameters ofour model affect its performance.a shows thatsetting to a small value harms the performance, indicat-ing that it is important to consider both the hyperbolic andEuclidean distances during training. b shows thatwhen c is set too large, the performance drops sharply asa result of the radius of the embedding space (ball) 1/c",
  ". Analysis of Embeddings": "shows the norms of the user and item embed-dings trained on the Amazon Women data set in hyperbolicspace (i.e., h(u) and h(v), respectively), which correspondto the distance distributions from the balls origin of thespace. It clearly indicates that items and users are separatedin the embedding space, with the items being placed nearthe origin and the users mapped near the balls surface.Next, we analyse the 2D-compressed representations ofthe users and items in 4a-4c, where each plot is coloredbased on the logarithmically transformed value of the num-ber of the purchases or purchases made. We can see thatitems with many purchases are mapped near the user em-beddings. We also calculate the correlation coefficient be-tween the norms of item embeddings and the number of pur-chases made, and observe that it is 0.360. This indicatesthat popular items tend to be mapped near the origin, andour proposed model separates items largely based on howpopular they are among users.",
  ". Conclusion": "In this paper, we proposed HVACF, a fashion item rec-ommendation model trained in hyperbolic space. Our ex-periments on three data sets showed that it performs betterthan previous models trained in Euclidean space, confirm-ing the effectiveness of our model. We also performed ab-lation studies and showed that it is crucial to consider bothhyperbolic and Euclidean distances in the objective func-tion. Lastly, we analysed the trained embeddings of usersand items and found that items and users are separated inhyperbolic space. We also found that popular and unpop-ular items are also separated in the space, with the popularones being centered near the origin.
