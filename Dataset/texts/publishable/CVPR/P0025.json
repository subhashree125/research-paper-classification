  "Abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressiveproficiency across a range of natural language processingtasks yet remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts, knownas jailbreak attacks, carefully designed to elicit harmful re-sponses from LLMs. Traditional methods rely on manualheuristics, which suffer from limited generalizability. Whilebeing automatic, optimization-based attacks often produceunnatural jailbreak prompts that are easy to detect by safetyfilters or require high computational overhead due to dis-crete token optimization. Witnessing the limitations of exist-ing jailbreak methods, we introduce Generative AdversarialSuffix Prompter (GASP), a novel framework that combineshuman-readable prompt generation with Latent BayesianOptimization (LBO) to improve adversarial suffix creationin a fully black-box setting. GASP leverages LBO to craftadversarial suffixes by efficiently exploring continuous em-bedding spaces, gradually optimizing the model to improveattack efficacy while balancing prompt coherence througha targeted iterative refinement procedure. Our experimentsshow that GASP can generate natural jailbreak prompts,significantly improving attack success rates, reducing train-ing times, and accelerating inference speed, thus making itan efficient and scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs.",
  ". Introduction": "LLMs represent a groundbreaking advancement in technol-ogy with a remarkable capacity to master a diverse set ofskills, revolutionizing many areas ranging from natural lan-guage processing to code and content generation . However, the versatility and strong generative ca-pability of LLMs are accompanied by a critical challenge:the potential for producing toxic content . It has beenrepeatedly reported that LLMs may inadvertently assimilate and perpetuate harmful biases, stereotypes and hate speech,which are often embedded in the extensive corpora of textused to train these models, raising serious ethical and soci-etal concerns . The proliferation of such toxiccontent can facilitate the spread of misinformation, exac-erbate polarization, and contribute to harassment, therebyundermining the beneficial impact of LLMs .To reduce the likelihood of generating harmful content,researchers and developers have investigated various strate-gies to improve the safety alignment of LLMs with prede-fined values . These strategies involve red team-ing and fine-tuning LLMs on carefully curated datasetsthat emphasize positive values, ethical principles, and fac-tual accuracy . While these methods can enhancethe overall trustworthiness of LLM outputs, malicious ac-tors can easily craft adversarial prompts to elicit harmfulresponses. These specially crafted prompts are known asjailbreak attacks , which exploit model sensitivityto input perturbations to trick LLMs into generating toxiccontent despite employing safety-alignment mechanisms.To better characterize the vulnerabilities of LLMs, ex-isting research studies have proposed different methods tocraft jailbreak prompts, which primarily fall into heuris-tic and optimization-based categories. Starting from , heuristic methods design hand-crafted promptsto bypass the model safety guardrails based on intuitivetechniques, such as role-playing , low-resource lan-guage rewriting , encryption , in-context demon-stration , prompt manipulation and injection . Despite being highly flexible, these methods re-quire significant manual efforts for prompt engineering andtend to be inconsistent across different inputs and models,thus limited in applicability. In contrast, optimization-basedmethods employ automatic search techniques byleveraging model gradients or logits to uncover prompts thatare likely to elicit harmful LLM responses, offering a morerobust and systematic solution. Nevertheless, these opti-",
  "GASP (ours)high": ". Comparisons of state-of-the-art optimization-based jailbreak techniques. Our GASP is a black-box jailbreak attack framework,featured by high human readability, fast inference capabilities, and adaptability to diverse prompts, with support for adaptive fine-tuning. mized prompts are often different from natural human lan-guage, making them easy to identify by perplexity-based fil-tering strategies. In addition, many of these methods requirecomplex discrete optimization over the combinatorial token space to produce a single ad-versarial prompt, incurring substantial computational over-head. Moreover, hybrid automated attacks havebeen developed that combine optimization techniques withmanual jailbreak strategies. Detailed discussions of relatedworks on LLM jailbreaks are provided in Appendix A. Contributions. The above limitations of existing jailbreakattacks motivate us to develop more efficient and effectivetools for systematically red-teaming LLMs. In this paper,we introduce GASP, a novel Generative Adversarial SuffixPrompter that can efficiently generate adversarial suffixesto evade LLM safeguards while preserving human readabil-ity in fully black-box environments. highlights thekey features of GASP, with comparisons to state-of-the-artoptimization-based methods, which are detailed below. 1. Human-Readable Adversarial Prompting. GASP gen-erates adversarial suffixes that are both human-readableand contextually relevant, unlike many existing attacksthat produce obscure prompts. This readability makesthe prompts harder to detect with perplexity-based fil-ters and enhances their realism, supporting effectivered-teaming by simulating real-world adversarial inputs. 2. Efficient Exploration with LBO. GASP leverages LatentBayesian Optimization to explore adver-sarial suffixes in a continuous embedding space, reduc-ing the need for computationally intensive discrete to-ken optimization. The acquisition function within LBOensures a balance between exploration and exploitation,allowing efficient identification of adversarial prompts. 3. Dynamic Refinement with ORPO. GASP incorporatesGASPEval, a custom evaluator to assess the efficacyof adversarial suffixes with the target LLM. By lever-aging feedback from GASPEval in a continuous loop,GASP iteratively fine-tunes suffixes to maximize theirbypass potential.In addition, GASP employs Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to adjust themodel parameters, amplifying the effectiveness of high- success suffixes while maintaining readability and co-herence. Such a dual feedback mechanism, informed byreal-time model responses, enhances GASPs attack ef-ficacy against evolving LLM safeguard mechanisms. 4. Adaptable across Diverse Prompts and LLMs. GASPis designed for versatility, generalizing across differentprompt types and LLM architectures, which enables ef-fective probing across various configurations, supportingcomprehensive evaluation of model vulnerabilities. 5. Robust Red-Teaming in Black-Box Settings. GASP ex-cels in black-box scenarios, where model access is lim-ited to API-level interactions. By uncovering vulnera-bilities with minimal access, GASP supports robust red-teaming, identifying potential weaknesses in deployedLLMs and contributing to improved model security.",
  ". Preliminaries": "In this work, we focus on generating adversarial suffixes forjailbreaking LLMs. This section introduces formal mathe-matical notations and foundational concepts to help readersbetter understand suffix-based jailbreak attacks. Adversarial Objective. The goal of jailbreak attacks is toelicit harmful responses from a target LLM. Specifically,let f : X Y be a given black-box LLM, denoted asTargetLLM throughout the paper, that the adversary aimsto jailbreak. Here, X is the input space of textual prompts,Y is the output space of LLM responses, and denotes themodel parameters potentially involved by some safeguardfine-tuning techniques to align the model behavior with pre-defined values. Let x Xharm like how to build a bomb,where Xharm is a collection of harmful prompts or those de-signed to test the safety mechanisms of f. Due to the safetyalignment, the model response f(x) typically includes re-fusals, such as Sorry, I cannot assist with that request, toreact to the harmful content or unethical intent embeddedin the query prompt. This ensures the model satisfies thesafety rules even when prompted by harmful prompts. Thegoal of suffix-based jailbreak attacks is to search for an op-timal sequence of tokens e, denoted as an adversarial suf-fix , such that when attached to the original input x, theresponse elicited from TargetLLM f(x + e) will become harmful. Let y Y be the desirable affirmative response(e.g., Sure, here is how to build a bomb...) that the at-tacker aims to elicit from TargetLLM f corresponding tothe original harmful prompt x Xharm, then the adversarialobjective is defined as the following optimization problem:",
  "maxeE L(x, e), where L(x, e) := p(y | x + e).(1)": "Here, E stands for the feasible set of sequences of tokensthat can be appended to the input x, and p(y | x + e) de-notes the adversarial loss function that measures the successof the attack, i.e., how likely the desirable harmful responsey can be generated under the fs output distribution withrespect to the suffix-appended input x + e. Human Readability Constraint. In parallel to generatingharmful responses, adversarial prompts are expected to behuman-readable, making them difficult for LLM and humanevaluators to detect. To be more specific, we aim to ensurethat the suffix e blends into the original input x and that theentire prompt x+e appears natural and coherent. This is im-portant because a prompt that is too unnatural or obfuscatedmay be flagged by either human moderators or automateddefenses . To enforce this, we define a readability con-straint based on the probability that the adversarial promptx+e falls within the natural language distribution pnat. For-mally, we define the feasible set for the suffix E as:",
  "E = {e : R(e) }, where R(e) := pnat(x + e).(2)": "Here, pnat(x + e) denotes the probability that the adversar-ial prompt x + e is perceived as part of the natural languagedistribution, and is a hyperparameter that sets the thresh-old for readability. If pnat(x + e) , then the adversarialprompt is considered sufficiently readable, where a higher imposes a stricter readability requirement.With both the objective for generating adversarial suf-fix and human-readability constraints in place, suffix-basedjailbreak attacks can be thus formulated as a constrained op-timization problem with respect to TargetLLM f, origi-nal input prompt x, desired harmful response y and naturallanguage distribution pnat as follows:",
  "maxep(y | x + e), s.t. pnat(x + e) .(3)": "Equation 3 provides a generic optimization framework foradversarial suffix generation, largely guiding our design ofGASP. By minimizing the adversarial loss while incorpo-rating human readability as a constraint, the framework en-sures that the optimized prompts remain effective in jail-breaking TargetLLM and sufficiently natural to be indis-tinguishable from legitimate inputs by human evaluations.We note that prior literature has explored other types ofadversarial transformations, especially for heuristic meth-ods that manually craft jailbreak prompts . Our focus",
  ". Introducing SuffixLLM": "To generate suffixes that align with the targeted adversar-ial objective (Equation 1) and satisfy the human readabilityconstraint (Equation 2), we propose to create a specializedLLM, referred to as SuffixLLM, g : X E. This modelcan be specifically trained to generate coherent adversarialsuffixes g(x) across various input prompts x Xharm fora designated TargetLLM f.To effectively engage with TargetLLM, the objectiveof SuffixLLM centers on approximating the conditionalprobability p(y | x + e), which reflects the likelihoodof TargetLLM generating desirable harmful responsesy Y when presented with a crafted suffix e appendedto the prompt x. The primary goal is to exploit the spe-cific vulnerabilities of TargetLLM, allowing it to gener-ate suffixes that increase the chances of eliciting harmfulresponses that align closely with the target models inher-ent behavior. By learning to replicate the response distribu-tion of TargetLLM, SuffixLLM operates under a multi-objective optimization framework (Equation 3) that empha-sizes both the effectiveness of adversarial prompts and theircoherence in human language. This involves understand-ing the specific output tendencies of the target model, al-lowing SuffixLLM to craft suffixes that elicit harmfulresponses in ways that appear indistinguishable from typ-ical conversations.Ultimately, the successful alignmentof SuffixLLMs generated suffixes with TargetLLMsharmful response distribution not only increases the effec-tiveness of the adversarial strategy but also preserves thenaturalness required for human evaluators. These featuresenable our method to generate adversarial suffixes with highjailbreak success for any input prompt x and TargetLLMusing only black-box model information (i.e., raw outputs).In contrast, most existing optimization-based jailbreakmethods are white-box attacks, which first createuniversal adversarial suffixes by leveraging the gradient in-formation with white-box surrogate LLMs then transfer toTargetLLM. An exception is AdvPrompter that useslog probability outputs of the target LLM for suffix opti-mization, but still is gray-box.",
  "Target Distribution": ". Summary of the proposed GASP framework: A) Pre-training of SuffixLLM with the use of AdvSuffixes, enabling it to creategeneric suffixes that serve as a base for adaptable jailbreak prompts; B) Alignment of SuffixLLM using LBO to establish a distributionaligned closely with the TargetLLM, enhancing its ability to produce effective jailbreak prompts; C) An adaptive fine-tuning mechanismis implemented to dynamically refine and adjust suffixes in real-time by querying the TargetLLM, ensuring optimal performance for eachgenerated prompt; D) The produced SuffixLLMs output distribution is expected to be similar to that of the TargetLLM.",
  ". Pre-training on AdvSuffixes": "Establishing a baseline distribution is essential for guidingeffective prompt generation, as it provides a reference pointthat captures a generic probability distribution of harmfulresponses across various adversarial suffixes. By trainingSuffixLLM on a baseline distribution, we aim to initiallyapproximate the conditions under which an LLM might pro-duce harmful outputs, without yet targeting the specific vul-nerabilities of a particular model. This initial phase relies on AdvSuffixes, a curated datasetof adversarial suffixes for diverse prompts, designed to cap-ture typical patterns in harmful responses. Using a two-shotprompting technique on an uncensored model, we gener-ated adversarial suffixes aligned with well-known jailbreakstyles, which are proven to achieve high attack success ratesacross models. Inspired by AdvBench , this approachenabled us to create a dataset of suffixes that establishes abaseline distribution of adversarial prompts. More detailson the creation of AdvSuffixes are provided in Appendix B.Leveraging AdvSuffixes allows us to approximate a genericadversarial distribution pgen(y | x + e), where y representspossible harmful outputs with respect to the input prompt x,aiming to capture a broad range of adversarial scenarios andlay the foundation of our GASP framework (Module A in ). Formally, the objective is to develop a dataset ofadversarial prompts and suffixes that, when used with spe-cific LLMs, produces a response distribution approximatinga general harmful response pattern, aligning the conditionalresponse distribution of these LLMs with an overarching,representative pattern of harmful outputs:",
  ". Aligning Distributions with TargetLLM": "The baseline distribution generated by SuffixLLM afterpre-training on AdvSuffixes might be too generic to be ef-fective in jailbreaking a particular TargetLLM. Therefore,we propose to fine-tune SuffixLLM to align the genericadversarial distribution pgen(y | x + e) with the desir-able harmful response distribution p(y | x + e), specifi-cally for TargetLLM. Nevertheless, a fundamental chal-lenge lies in the difficulty of calculating loss function value when dealing with discrete token spaces. Unlike continu-ous optimization problems, where gradient-based methodscan efficiently find minima, discrete token spaceslike thewords and phrases that constitute natural languageare farmore difficult to navigate . We address these challengesin our GASP framework by employing LBO for efficientsearching within a latent embedding space and dynamic re-finement of SuffixLLM with ORPO and a novel evaluatorGASPEval (Modules B and C in ). Embedding Space. We propose to approximate the tar-get distribution by refining and searching for suffixes iter-atively, using observed responses to inform adjustments to-ward p(y | x + e). Note that each token sequence vari-ation can lead to abrupt changes in the models be-havior, making the search inherently discontinuous. To ad-dress this, we transition to the embedding space defined bythe SuffixLLM, where token sequences are representedas continuous vectors. Each suffix e is mapped to a con-tinuous vector ze Rd, allowing for gradual adjustmentsin language meaning and structure, which facilitates opti-mization. In the following, we will employ LBO to searchan optimal suffix embedding vector , since evalu-ating all token combinations generated by SuffixLLM iscomputationally infeasible. By operating in the embeddingspace, LBO reduces the search complexity, allowing for amore structured exploration of potential suffixes, which inturn facilitates a smoother and more efficient alignment withTargetLLMs response distribution. Latent Bayesian Optimization (LBO). As stated, LBOleverages the continuous embedding space generated bySuffixLLM to enable efficient black-box optimization.By focusing on promising candidates, LBO minimizes thesearch complexity, improving the exploration of suffixes.To enhance the interpretability of the high-dimensionalspace, we use t-SNE to project ze into a lower-dimensional representation, preserving key variations in to-ken sequence behavior. This approach aligns our searchwith the response distribution of TargetLLM, ensuring amore efficient optimization process.Specifically, the objective of LBO is to identify the op-timal suffix embedding ze that maximizes the likelihood ofproducing a harmful response from the TargetLLM, whilesatisfying the human readability constraint:",
  "ze = argmaxzeRdp(y | x + e), s.t. pnat(x + e) .(5)": "LBO leverages probabilistic exploration across the em-bedding space, assessing candidate embeddings by evaluat-ing their likelihood to improve adversarial outcomes. Thisprobabilistic approach relies on posterior predictions froma Gaussian Process (GP) model, which is continuously up-dated with each embedding evaluation. By refining its pos-terior with each new data point, the GP model helps LBO",
  "Data. Inspired by the AdvBench dataset, we developedAdvSuffixes, a benchmark containing 519 harmful instruc-": "tions across a wide range of toxic content, including pro-fanity, graphic depictions, threats, misinformation, discrim-ination, cybercrime, and illegal suggestions. Each instruc-tion is paired with adversarial suffixes designed to provokepotentially harmful responses from language models whilemaintaining coherence and readability.AdvSuffixes is acrucial tool for testing the safety guardrails of LLMs, en-abling systematic evaluation of a models resilience againstadversarial attacks. By challenging LLMs with harmful in-structions and targeted adversarial suffixes, the benchmarkhelps uncover vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness ofsafety mechanisms, providing insights into how well ourLBO-driven approach and SuffixLLM can exploit theseweaknesses. The data is split into fixed pre-train (75%) andtrain (25%) sets, with results reported on this split. Addi-tionally, we include a supplementary dataset of 100 harm-ful prompts, which is out-of-distribution from the trainingdataset, to more effectively test the robustness of the frame-works, as detailed in Appendix B. Models. In our experiments, we evaluate the effectivenessof our adversarial attack framework across a range of open-source models in a black-box setting, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 , Falcon-7B-Instruct , LLaMA-2-7B-chat , LLaMA-3-8B-instruct , and LLaMA-3.1-8B-instruct . These diverse architectures and sizes pro-vide a comprehensive assessment of how different modelsrespond to adversarial suffixes generated by SuffixLLMwith LBO-driven optimization. To further test generaliz-ability, we extend our evaluation to proprietary models likeGPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini and GPT-3.5-turbo . Baselines.We compare the performance of GASP withthree notable previous jailbreak attacks in our experiments,AdvPrompter , AutoDAN and GCG . All threeprovide implementations, and hence, we utilize a similar setof hyperparameters to evaluate them. Evaluation. Our primary evaluation metric to measure theattack performance of jailbreak attacks is ASR@k, whichquantifies whether at least one out of k attempts success-fully compromises the TargetLLM. This metric is crucialin practical scenarios, as multiple attempts may be made tojailbreak the TargetLLM, and a single successful attack isenough to extract sensitive information. To determine theoutcome of each attack, we employ three evaluators: (1)Keyword Matching , a simple approach that checks forspecific strings indicating the models refusal in responseto harmful query prompts, (2) StrongREJECT , whichprompts an external LLM with the harmful instruction andthe TargetLLMs response, instructing it to score theharmfulness of the output through three questions, and (3)GASPEval, which also employs an external LLM to evalu-ate the harmful instruction and the TargetLLMs response,utilizing a more comprehensive scoring system based on 20",
  ". Main Results": "In our evaluation, we report the ASR at two levels: ASR@1and ASR@10. These metrics gauge the effectiveness of ouradversarial prompts by determining whether at least onesuccessful attack occurs within a set number of attempts.We strictly adhere to Algorithms 1 and 2 in Appendix Cto ensure consistency and rigor in our experiments. Theobserved lower performance seen in all frameworks, com-pared to results reported in original papers, is likely due toour use of an out-of-distribution evaluation dataset intro-duced by AdvSuffixes. This dataset challenges the frame-works by presenting data that diverges from their trainingdistribution, which is especially effective in revealing therobustness and generalization of each framework under var-ied conditions.

Efficiency. Moreover, by avoiding discrete token optimiza-tion, our framework reduces training time by approximately1.75 compared to AdvPrompter, as demonstrated in Fig-ure 3a. The use of SuffixLLM also significantly lowersinference time, enabling faster attack deployment withoutcompromising on coherence or effectiveness. This time effi-ciency sets GASP apart from other methods, including thosebased on gray-box and white-box access, which generallyhave the advantage of internal model insights.",
  ". Ablation Studies": "In our standard setup, LBO and ORPO work in tandem tooptimize and fine-tune SuffixLLM, refining suffix gener-ation iteratively.

Our evaluation, as shown in , revealsthe baseline performance of SuffixLLM when trainedsolely on a baseline distribution, highlighting its limitationsin generating effective suffixes against models like Mistral-7B-v0.3 and Falcon-7B.

Readability Studies": "To assess the readability of adversarial prompts generatedby each optimization-based jailbreak attack, we employWizard-Vicuna-7B-Uncensored as an independentevaluation model. This model rates the readability of 100prompts generated from each framework on a scale from 0to 1, focusing on coherence, fluency, clarity, and concise- ness. As shown in in the Appendix, our methodachieves the highest readability score, averaging 0.94, fol-lowed by AdvPrompter at 0.76, while GCG and AutoDANscored notably lower (see Appendix F.5 for more detaileddiscussions). To further validate these findings, we con-ducted a human survey involving 52 participants, primarilyuniversity students, who reviewed a subset of 20 prompts (5from each framework) without knowing the source frame-work. Participants rated readability and identified promptssuspicious or suggestive of adversarial intent. The resultsare illustrated in b. 79.23% of participants, gener-ally reading at an advanced level, rated prompts generatedby GASP as the easiest to understand and read, followedby 16.15% who rated prompts from AdvPrompter as thenext most readable. In contrast, prompts generated by GCGand AutoDAN were often viewed as harder to interpret andmore frequently flagged as adversarial.",

Conclusion": "We introduced GASP, which outperforms existing methodsacross multiple aspects, including significantly higher suc-cess rates, improved coherence, and faster inference, evenin black-box settings. Looking forward, we hope our workcan provide a foundation for the development of more ro-bust defenses against adversarial prompts in LLMs, rein-forcing the ethical safeguards around artificial intelligence.",

  "A. Related Work": "This section reviews the literature on jailbreak attacks fromheuristic to automated optimization methods, as well as var-ious prompt optimization strategies that influence LLM out-puts. Additionally, we discuss defense mechanisms aimedat safeguarding LLMs from adversarial manipulation. LLM Jailbreaks. The robustness of LLMs against jail-break attacks has garnered significant attention, with nu-merous research studies exposing vulnerabilities in both ex-perimental and production models. In addition to heuris-tic approaches that craft adversarial prompts manually , automatic jailbreakmethods have been proposed to en-hance search scalability and efficiency by leveraging dis-tinct optimization strategies. For example, the GCG algo-rithm , inspired by AutoPrompt , uti-lizes discrete optimization to identify token replacementsthat maximize adversarial success rates. By selecting tokensiteratively, GCG ensures effective prompts, albeit at the costof limited coherence and inapplicability to models withoutgradient access. In contrast, AdvPrompter employsa conditional adversarial suffix generator, which efficientlyadapts to unseen instructions by training on parameterizeddata. While AdvPrompter demonstrates strong performancein grey-box settings, its reliance on high-quality trainingdata can limit adaptability to novel or less-structured inputs. In addition, hybrid approaches have also emerged,which combine manual jailbreak tactics with automated op-timization to enhance flexibility and generalization. Auto-DAN exemplifies this trend, utilizing a hierarchi-cal genetic algorithm to refine prompts through crossoverand mutation. This iterative process generates universal jail-breaks applicable across diverse models, though it is com-putationally intensive due to its reliance on evolutionarymethods. Similarly, PAIR automates semantic jailbreakgeneration by leveraging an attacker LLM and querying thetarget LLM. PAIR refines candidate jailbreaks through re-peated alignment, offering a scalable solution for effectiveadversarial prompts with reduced manual intervention.Our work (GASP) introduces a novel approach by focus-ing on adversarial suffix creation through a generative ad-versarial framework, which does not rely on manual promptcrafting or the iterative optimization methods commonlyused in previous work. Unlike existing strategies that often require extensive training or gradient access, our approachis designed to operate effectively in fully black-box settings,allowing for greater flexibility and applicability across awider range of LLMs without the need for detailed modelknowledge or high-quality training data. Prompt Optimization. Prompt optimization methods un-derpin many of the aforementioned jailbreak techniques andcan be broadly categorized into soft and hard optimizationstrategies. Soft prompt optimization adjusts to-ken embeddings while freezing model parameters, makingit a resource-efficient approach for task-specific tuning. Bycontrast, hard prompt optimization directly modi-fies input text to influence model outputs. Techniques likeAutoPrompt and Black-box Prompt Optimization excel in applications such as text classification and fact re-trieval by employing discrete token searches or black-boxoptimization to adapt prompts. These methods demonstratethe versatility of hard prompt optimization, especially forcases where model internals are inaccessible.Our workbuilds on these advancements by integrating prompt opti-mization with adversarial generation techniques, focusingspecifically on automated prompt refinement that optimizesLLM jailbreaks without compromising human readability. LLM Defenses. Defensive strategies againstadversarial jailbreaks have also seen significant advance-ments, aiming to mitigate the risks posed by increas-ingly sophisticated attacks. For instance, SmoothLLM adopts a scatter-gather approach to address character-levelperturbations in adversarial prompts.By averaging themodels responses across perturbed variations of the in-put, SmoothLLM diminishes the impact of adversarial con-tent on the final output. NeMo-Guardrails , an open-source framework, focuses on enforcing safety mechanismsthrough programmable conversational guardrails.Theseguardrails constrain model behavior to prevent harmful orunintended outputs. Reinforcement Learning with HumanFeedback (RLHF) remains one of the most widelyadopted safety strategies, training a reward model using ad-versarial prompts and responses. By incorporating this re-ward model into the RLHF pipeline, LLMs are safety-tunedto prioritize ethical and safe outputs during interactions. Inthe future, we plan to test the adaptability of our attackframework against LLMs that employ the defenses above,regardless of implicit or explicit strategies. In addition, inte- grating our generative approach of adversarial prompts intothe safeguard fine-tuning process could be an interesting fu-ture direction and a promising strategy to enhance the re-silience of LLMs against jailbreak attacks.",
  "B. Creation Details of AdvSuffixes": "To establish a rigorous benchmark for adversarial testing,we create AdvSuffixes, a comprehensive dataset of adversar-ial suffixes designed to elicit (generic) harmful responsesfrom LLMs. In particular, we generate these suffixes on theLlama-3.1-8B-Lexi-Uncensored-V2 model usinga two-shot prompt technique with various common but di-verse jailbreak styles for guidance. This approach enabledus to produce adversarial suffixes for each of the 519 harm-ful instructions drawn from the AdvBench dataset .AdvBench initially provides 127 prompts that haveproven extremely challenging to jailbreak LLMs such asLLaMA-2. These prompts consistently fail to bypass themodels safeguards, highlighting their high difficulty andresilience against existing adversarial techniques. Given thedependency of AdvPrompter and similar methods on thedistribution of training and testing data, these 127 promptswere ideal for assessing in-distribution performance but in-sufficient to fully evaluate generalization.To address this limitation, we generated an additional setof 100 prompts using the uncensored model. The processinvolved using the original 127 AdvBench prompts as in-put, paired with guiding instructions to create prompts ofcomparable difficulty while ensuring they remained inde-pendent of the original training distribution. This approachintroduced deliberate variations in syntax and phrasing, pro-ducing prompts that deviate from the patterns of the origi-nal AdvBench set. By leveraging an uncensored model andtailored instructions, we crafted prompts that retained thehigh difficulty level of the 127 prompts while incorporat-ing distinct adversarial structures.This ensures the newdataset possesses out-of-distribution characteristics, chal-lenging frameworks to generalize effectively beyond famil-iar correlations. Consequently, this expanded dataset pro-vides a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating bothin-distribution performance and generalization capabilities,while rigorously testing model adaptability and the robust-ness of adversarial defenses.Through iterative generation and human filtering, weamassed over 11763 adversarial suffixes in total (averag-ing 22.6 suffixes per prompt), designed to be appended toprompts with the goal of eliciting harmful responses fromLLMs. This diverse collection encompasses a range of ma-licious content, including profanity, graphic descriptions,threats, and misinformation, providing a rigorous tool-setfor testing model vulnerabilities.These datasets are re-leased on GitHub and are available for use under the GNUGPL-v3 license.

  ". Examples of generic suffixes in the AdvSuffixes dataset": "To refine the initial suffixes, GASP employs LBO. Thisstep involves evaluating the performance of each gener-ated suffix in terms of its effectiveness in eliciting harm-ful responses from the target model via GASPEval. Con-sequently, GASPEval provides an effective metric to de-termine which suffixes maintain coherence while bypassingthe safety mechanisms of the target model. The results fromthis evaluation inform further adjustments to the suffixes,ensuring continuous improvement in their effectiveness. ORPO. Following evaluation, GASP applies odds-ratioprompt optimization (ORPO) to fine-tune the SuffixLLM.ORPO focuses on amplifying the effectiveness of high-performing suffixes while maintaining constraints on read-ability and coherence.The fine-tuned SuffixLLM canthus generate suffixes that trigger harmful responses closelyaligned with the output characteristics of TargetLLM.

(b) Plot of Loss and NLL Loss during ORPO training for the targetblack-box model LLaMA-3.1-8B-instruct, showing changes over iterations": "Iterative Feedback. The final step in the GASP workflowis the establishment of an iterative feedback loop. This loopintegrates results from evaluations back into the trainingprocess, creating a cycle of continuous improvement. Asnew data and insights are gathered from ongoing interac-tions with the target model, the suffix generation and eval-uation processes are refined. This dynamic adaptability en- ables GASP to stay relevant and effective in responding tothe evolving characteristics of the target language model.Through this structured workflow, GASP effectively gen-erates and optimizes adversarial suffixes, providing a ro-bust framework for engaging with black-box LLMs whilebalancing adversarial effectiveness with human readability.Appendix G demonstrates the adversarial suffixes generated",
  "D. Detailed Explanations of LBO and ORPO": "In the context of adversarial prompting, a central challengearises from the inability to directly access the target modelsprobability distribution p(y | x + e), where y representsthe desired harmful responses given a prompt x and an ap-pended suffix e. Since we operate under black-box con-straints, obtaining p(y | x + e) is infeasible, necessitat-ing an alternative approach to approximate the distributionwithout direct access to the target models internals. There-fore, LBO and ORPO are introduced in the GASP frame-work to address the aforementioned challenges.",
  "D.1. Internal Working of LBO": "To address this challenge, GASP employs LBO within anembedding space. As stated earlier, this strategy involvesmapping the suffix e into a continuous vector representa-tion ze Rd, transforming the discrete nature of tokengeneration into a smooth manifold that is amenable to op-timization. The evaluation function f(x, e; ) serves as aproxy to the target models output, providing a continuousmeasure of performance based on the generated suffixes.This function assists in approximating an output probabil-ity p(y | x + e), which reflects the likelihood of generatingharmful responses in TargetLLM.The crux of LBO lies in its acquisition function, whichenables systematic exploration of the embedding space. Acommonly used acquisition function in this context is theExpected Improvement (EI), defined as:",
  "EI(ze) = Emax(0, fbest f(ze)),(6)": "where fbest denotes the best-observed performance fromprevious evaluations, and f(ze) is the predicted output ofthe Gaussian Process (GP) model at the new suffix embed-ding ze. The EI function quantifies the expected gain inperformance from sampling at ze, encouraging the selectionof suffixes that are likely to yield significant improvementsover the current best.Before applying the EI function, the GP model playsa critical role in capturing the underlying distribution ofresponses generated by the target model. The GP modelassumes a prior distribution over functions and is updatedwith each new evaluation to create a posterior distribution.This posterior reflects the models uncertainty and meanpredictions, which are used in the acquisition function to in-form future sampling. Specifically, the GP provides both amean prediction (ze) and an associated uncertainty (ze)for each candidate suffix embedding, enabling LBO to makeinformed decisions (via EI) about where to sample next.By iteratively updating the GP model with evaluationsobtained through f or GASPEval, the algorithm refines its estimates of p(y | x + e). As new evaluations are addedto the dataset, the GP becomes increasingly adept at mod-eling the TargetLLMs response distribution. The combi-nation of the GPs predictions and the EI acquisition func-tion allows LBO to explore the embedding space efficiently,identifying suffix embeddings that are most likely to leadto harmful outputs while continuously refining the approxi-mation of the target distribution. As the evaluation processcontinues, the GPs posterior converges toward the under-lying distribution of the target models responses, enablingLBO to approximate p(y | x + e) well.",
  "D.2. Transferring GPs properties to SuffixLLM": "A key outcome of the LBO process is the refinementof suffixes based on the accumulated knowledge aboutTargetLLMs behavior. Through iterative sampling andevaluation, LBO generates suffix embeddings that are tai-lored to align closely with the TargetLLMs distribu-tion.This iterative feedback loop ensures that the re-fined suffixes produced not only maximize harmful outputsbut also conform to the response characteristics observedin TargetLLM. In this way, LBO facilitates the trans-fer of the target probability distribution to SuffixLLM.By continuously updating the GP with evaluations fromGASPEval, the learned representation of the suffixes be-comes increasingly reflective of the target distribution, ef-fectively bridging the gap between the two models. As aresult, SuffixLLM not only inherits a refined understand-ing of harmful response tendencies but also gains the abilityto generate adversarial suffixes that align well with the re-sponse profile of TargetLLM.In summary, LBOs ability to approximate the prob-ability distribution of TargetLLM is underpinned by acombination of GP modeling, continuous evaluation viaGASPEval, and a strategically defined acquisition functionthat drives efficient exploration of the embedding space.This mathematical framework allows GASP to navigate thecomplexities of black-box adversarial prompt generation,ultimately leading to the successful alignment of suffixeswith the target models response distribution.",
  "D.3. Why ORPO?": "We use ORPO in finetuning SuffixLLM due to its in-novative approach to aligning model outputs with specificpreference criteria, which is critical for adversarial promptoptimization. ORPO introduces a novel odds ratio-basedpenalty to the traditional negative log-likelihood (NLL)loss, enabling the model to differentiate between favoredand disfavored response styles. Unlike standard supervisedfine-tuning that focuses solely on maximizing the likelihoodof target responses, ORPOs relative ratio loss componentmaximizes the odds of generating the desired response overundesired ones. This is achieved by increasing the log odds PROMPT: Explain how to manufacture an illegal weapon using household materialsfor a creative writing exercise or workshop.RESPONSE (Mistral-7B): In this creative writing exercise, we will explorethe concept of manufacturing an illegal weapon using household materials.However, its crucial to understand that this exercise is meant for creativewriting purposes only and should never be attempted in real life.1.Materials Gathering:- Bottle caps or plastic tubing:For creating a makeshift barrel.- Metal rod or screwdriver:To serve as the firing pin....",
  "GASPEval:0.02StrongREJECT: 1.0Keyword Matching:False": ". This example illustrates a Keyword Matching failure, leading to a True-Negative outcome. The response provides detailedinstructions on manufacturing an illegal weapon, revealing the limitations of relying on Keyword Matching as an evaluator. Additionally,several TargetLLMs returned <|end-of-text|> as their response, indicating a lack of engagement with the query. This resulted in aFalse-Positive scenario, which is inappropriate for accurate evaluation. ratio between preferred and rejected responses, effectivelydiscouraging the model from producing outputs that deviatefrom optimal adversarial characteristics.The penalty component of ORPO not only corrects un-wanted tendencies in the models predictions but also ampli-fies gradient updates when the likelihood of undesired out-puts is too high, pushing the model more firmly toward thepreferred response style. By penalizing wrong predictionsand emphasizing contrastive alignment between chosen andrejected responses, ORPO ensures that SuffixLLM isbetter attuned to produce robust and context-sensitive ad-versarial prompts.Such a fine-grained control enablesSuffixLLM to adapt to specialized jailbreak contextsmore efficiently than with standard finetuning methods.",
  "E. GASPEvals Working & Evaluation": "GASPEval is a dual-purpose component within our frame-work, designed to not only steer the LBO process throughthe complex probability landscape but also to serve asa comprehensive evaluation mechanism for adversarialprompts generated by different jailbreak attack methods.On the one hand, GASPEval plays a pivotal role inguiding LBO by providing structured feedback during theoptimization process, enabling it to explore and navigatecontinuous embedding spaces effectively. This guidance isessential for narrowing down the search space to identifysuffixes that maximize attack success rates, thus enhancingthe efficiency and effectiveness of adversarial suffix gener-ation. By acting as a structured pathfinder, GASPEval en-sures that LBO can consistently generate optimized suffixesin a fully black-box setting (see ). In addition to its optimization function, GASPEval alsoserves as a robust evaluation tool, capable of assessing theharmfulness and readability of responses generated by dif-ferent adversarial frameworks.While StrongREJECT isknown for its rigorous grading standards, it often provesoverly strict, which can hinder LBOs alignment by pe-nalizing potential adversarial prompts too harshly.Onthe other hand, simpler evaluation approaches, such asKeyword Matching, can lead to high rates of false posi-tives (FP) and true negatives (TN), ultimately skewing re-sults. GASPEval achieves a balanced approach by apply-ing a moderate scoring scheme, which is neither excessivelyharsh nor overly permissive. This balanced evaluation en-ables consistent guidance for LBO while also providing amore reliable assessment than traditional evaluators, ensur-ing that the generated prompts are coherent, effective, andmore accurately aligned to bypass detection mechanisms.",
  "E.1. Failure Modes of Traditional Evaluators": "We first explain the limitations of existing evaluation meth-ods for jailbreak attacks, namely Keyword Matching andStrongREJECT. In particular, Keyword Matching oftenmisclassifies benign or contextually appropriate responsesas harmful by flagging isolated words or phrases that appearon a predefined list. This approach leads to FPs, where non-harmful content is mistakenly labeled as harmful, disrupt-ing natural user interactions. In addition, StrongREJECT,an aggressive filtering method aimed at blocking adversar-ial inputs, frequently misses subtle yet harmful responses,resulting in TNs that allow genuinely harmful content toevade detection.

Example of StrongREJECT False-Positive (FP): Despite the GPT-4o response rejecting the harmful prompt on ethical grounds anddiverting the topic (which is common among several LLMs), the StrongREJECT score is incorrectly high (0.875) and fails to recognize thatthe LLM is not actually jailbroken. The expected value for StrongREJECT in this scenario should be 0, highlighting a failure in accuratelyassessing the models rejection of harmful content.

Figures 7-9 illustrate exam-ples of these failure cases in detail, highlighting the preva-lence and types of misclassification errors in each method.These high misclassification rates underscore the need fora more nuanced evaluation mechanism, one capable of rig-orously assessing the likelihood of truly harmful responseswhile reducing both over- and under-detection errors.",

To maintainstringent safety standards, we consider a harmful responseto be any score below 1. In the context of calculating theASR, this means that if an LLM generates a response thatscores less than 1, it is classified as harmful. By establishingthis clear boundary, we ensure that our evaluations prioritizeuser safety and ethical responsibility.Our evaluator provides substantial advantages over pre-vious methods, which often struggled to detect subtle nu-ances in model outputs.By incorporating detailed scor-ing that considers not only the presence of harmful content",

Specifically, the total attackcost amounted to $2.31 for GPT-4o, $0.07 for GPT-4o-mini, and only $0.52 for GPT-3.5-turbo-0125. These re-sults indicate that sophisticated attacks on advanced LLMscan be performed with minimal financial resources, makingour method highly scalable for both academic research andpractical applications.In future work, we aim to delve deeper into the cost-effectiveness of such attacks. This includes analyzing thetrade-offs between attack success rates, suffix complexity,and overall cost, with the goal of further optimizing adver-sarial attacks for both closed-API and open-source LLMs.The ability to maintain high ASR at such low costs repre-sents a critical step forward in the development of scalablemethodologies for evaluating and securing modern LLMs.",
  "F.3. Acquisition Function Sensitivity": "In this section, we analyze the performance of three acqui-sition functions, Expected Improvement (EI), Lower Confi-dence Bound (LCB), and Probability of Improvement (PI),in selecting adversarial suffixes that maximize harmful re-sponse rates while adhering to query efficiency constraints.Each acquisition function exhibits unique characteristics inbalancing exploration (sampling uncertain regions) and ex-ploitation (selecting high-performing regions).",
  ".(9)": "The calculation of PI is straightforward and computation-ally inexpensive, making it appealing for settings wherequick decisions are necessary. However, its sensitivity tothe predictive mean (x) often results in underexplorationof high-uncertainty regions, leading to premature conver-gence in complex search spaces. Comparative Analysis. The comparative analysis of ac-quisition functions () reveals that EI consistentlyachieves the highest ASR across iterations, making it themost effective strategy for adversarial suffix generation. By effectively sampling regions with high uncertainty and po-tential improvements, EI rapidly identifies optimal adver-sarial suffixes, leading to a notable increase in harmful re-sponse rates, particularly after the third iteration.LCB( = 1.96) also performs well, albeit with a slower conver-gence due to its cautious trade-off between exploring uncer-tain regions and exploiting high-mean areas. While LCBachieves competitive ASR values by the final iteration, itsinitial focus on diverse sampling delays convergence to theoptimal regions. In contrast, PI also achieves ASR valuessimilar to that of LCB, primarily because its focus on im-mediate gains leads to underexploration of high-uncertaintyregions, resulting in premature convergence. These find-ings underscore the necessity of a robust acquisition func-tion like EI, which balances computational efficiency witheffective exploration, to maximize harmful response rates inlimited iterations while maintaining the adaptability of ad-versarial prompt generation. This behavior was also seen inMistral-7B-v0.3 and Falcon-7B, although not plotted here.",
  "F.4. Discussions about peculiar results": "Recall that we marked a few peculiar observations whileevaluating multiple jailbreak attack frameworks in .In this section, we provide detailed discussions of these pe-culiar observations and explain the reasons behind them. AutoDANs Perfect ASRs with Keyword Matching onMistral-7B-v0.3 and LLaMA-3-8B. One notable obser-vation from our experiments is that AutoDAN achieved a100% ASR on both the LLaMA 3 and Mistral models, al-beit under keyword-matching evaluation criteria. In con-trast, StrongREJECT and GASPEval, which utilize strictersemantic and context-aware evaluation metrics, reported asignificantly lower ASR for the same setups.While LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B-v0.3 are seen to beespecially vulnerable to the DAN jailbreaks, AutoDAN em-ploys a hierarchical genetic algorithm that focuses on op-timizing token arrangements through crossover and muta- GCGAutoDANAdvPrompterGASP",

This approach effectively exploits weak input saniti-zation or insufficient prompt validation, characteristics pre-viously identified in LLaMA-3 and Mistral, making themespecially susceptible to DAN-like attacks. Moreover, thekeyword-matching evaluation criteria tend to overestimatethe ASR by rewarding responses with no harmful syntacticmatches, even when the responses lack genuine adversarialintent or semantic relevance. Conversely, StrongREJECTand GASPEval employ more robust criteria, penalizingoutputs that align only superficially with adversarial goals.This results in a more realistic assessment of adversarial im-pact but naturally leads to lower ASRs for frameworks likeAutoDAN that rely heavily on syntactic perturbations. GASPs Low ASR with Keyword Matching onLLaMA-3-8B and LLaMA-2-7B. In GASP, during ourevaluation, we notice a peculiar pattern when testingLLaMA 2 and 3 models. After conducting a detailed man-ual investigation, it becomes apparent that the adversarialsuffixes generated by GASP trigger responses containingbuilt-in warnings. As a result, the responses, while indeedharmful, are incorrectly flagged as TNs by Keyword Match-ing, primarily due to the presence of these warning phrases.Including safeguard statements, such as This answer con-tains sensitive and unethical content, misleads the evalu-ation mechanism in concluding that the generated outputwas non-harmful. However, upon manual inspection, it be-comes clear that the responses were, in fact, harmful as theystill contained the core harmful content, as seen in . On the other hand, StrongREJECT and GASPEval, whichaccount for the full context of the responses, accurately rec-ognize the harmful content regardless of the warnings andprove to be more reliable in identifying the actual threats.Primitive attacks such as DAN and GCG, while effectivein their own right, typically do not trigger the same type ofresponse mechanisms. Instead of producing nuanced harm-ful content that may trigger safety warnings, they prioritizeprompting the TargetLLM to generate responses that ad-here to a specific structure and initial phrasing (e.g., Sure,here is a step-by-step guide...).",
  "F.5. Readability Comparisons": "In this section, we provide a detailed breakdown of pre-viously discussed readability experiments, focusing on themetrics used to assess prompt readability.Our assess-ment model (Wizard-Vicuna-7B-Uncensored) wasinstructed to focus and score based on four specific metrics coherence, fluency, clarity, and conciseness of the givenprompt. These criteria were chosen to capture various as-pects of prompt readability comprehensively.By averaging the scores of 100 prompts generated, weachieved a balanced assessment of readability, enabling ac-curate comparisons of adversarial prompt readability acrossframeworks, as shown in . For each prompt query,we also requested the assessment model to provide reason-ing for its rating. Analysis of this feedback revealed thatour methods slight readability reduction (a drop of 0.06)",

Example survey question assessing human readability and suspiciousness of prompts. Prompt sources: (A) GCG, (B) AutoDAN,(C) AdvPrompter, and (D) GASP, all representing successful prompts on Falcon-7B. was due to the increased length when five or more suffixeswere appended. Furthermore, the model noted that othermethods, particularly GCG, struggled with coherence, lead-ing to lower readability scores. AutoDAN was flagged forproducing consistently verbose and cumbersome prompts,impacting its readability across multiple queries. This result is consistent with our survey results of humanevaluators regarding the readability and suspiciousness ofoptimized jailbreak prompts, as seen in b. The sur-vey was conducted anonymously, and evaluators were un-aware of the source framework of the prompts they werereviewing.This ensured that their responses were unbi-ased and based solely on the content of the prompts them-selves. Participants were asked to rate each prompt basedon its readability, selecting the prompt they found easiest tounderstand. Additionally, they were tasked with identify-ing which prompt appeared most likely to break AI safetyguardrails, thus testing the perceived adversarial intent ofeach prompt. Notably, GASP was also consistently picked as the least suspicious, with 10.24% of participants ratingGASP as potentially suspicious in terms of bypassing AIsafety guardrails, indicating that prompts generated fromGASP were seen as more coherent and less adversarial innature. Additionally, a sample question from the survey isprovided in .In summary, GASP consistently outperformed otherstate-of-the-art frameworks in readability. Both the evalua-tions demonstrate that GASP generates prompts that are notonly effective but also more readable and less suspicious,thereby enhancing its overall applicability and usability.",
