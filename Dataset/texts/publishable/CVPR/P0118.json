  "Abstract": "Building an embodied agent system with a large lan-guage model (LLM) as its core is a promising direction.Due to the significant costs and uncontrollable factors as-sociated with deploying and training such agents in the realworld, we have decided to begin our exploration within theMinecraft environment. Our STEVE Series agents can com-plete basic tasks in a virtual environment and more chal-lenging tasks such as navigation and even creative tasks,with an efficiency far exceeding previous state-of-the-artmethods by a factor of 2.5 to 7.3. We begin our ex-ploration with a vanilla large language model, augment-ing it with a vision encoder and an action codebase trainedon our collected high-quality dataset STEVE-21K. Subse- quently, we enhanced it with a Critic and memory to trans-form it into a complex system. Finally, we constructed ahierarchical multi-agent system. Our recent work exploredhow to prune the agent system through knowledge distilla-tion. In the future, we will explore more potential applica-tions of STEVE agents in the real world. The code, data,and models are available at site.",

Despite this progress, chal-lenges remain in achieving seamless integration of multi-modal inputs and dynamic, autonomous decision-makingthat mirrors human-like intelligence and adaptability withinsuch a variable and rich environment.",
  ". Hierarchical Multi-Agent System": "Introduced in STEVE-1.5, our Hierarchical Multi-AgentSystem enhances multi-agent cooperation for complex navi-gation and creation tasks in Minecraft. This system supportscentralized planning and decentralized execution, enablingagents to adjust strategies and dynamically improve interac-tion with the environment. STEVE-2 extends this systemscapabilities, accommodating a broader range of activitiesand pushing the boundaries of autonomous multi-agent sys-tems.",
  ". Distill Embodied Agent into a Single Model": "STEVE-2 introduces a hierarchical knowledge distil-lation process that refines the alignment of tasks across var-ious granularity levels within our agent system. This pro-cess incorporates the extra expert to enhance the teachermodel with prior knowledge, significantly improving train-ing quality for complex tasks. By distilling capabilities intoa single model, STEVE-2 achieves operational sim-plicity and superior performance, setting a new benchmarkin autonomous agent capabilities within Minecraft.",
  ". Basic Skill": "The STEVE series demonstrates prowess in KnowledgeQuestion and Answering and Tech Tree Mastery. STEVE-13B excels in producing precise Minecraft-related answers,surpassing both LLaMA2 and GPT-4 . In Tech TreeMastery, STEVE-1 progresses through Minecraftstech levels faster than competitors like AutoGPT andVoyager , showcasing effective use of its vision unit tohandle complex crafting tasks.",
  ". Navigation": "STEVE-2 excels in multi-modal goal search, continu-ous block search, and map exploration, outperforming ex-isting models by substantial margins. In multi-modal goalsearch, STEVE-2 identifies goals using various sensory in-puts with performance 5.5 better than leading LLM-basedmethods. For map exploration, STEVE-2 updates and ex-pands game maps with 1.9 the efficiency of previousmodels, using a dynamic strategy tailored to unexplored ar-eas.",
