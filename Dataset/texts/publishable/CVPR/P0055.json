  "Abstract": "Recent advancements in deep learning for predicting 3Dprotein structures have shown promise, particularly whenleveraging inputs like protein sequences and Cryo-Electronmicroscopy (Cryo-EM) images. However, these techniquesoften fall short when predicting the structures of proteincomplexes (PCs), which involve multiple proteins. In ourstudy, we investigate using atomic force microscopy (AFM)combined with deep learning to predict the 3D structuresof PCs. AFM generates height maps that depict the PCs invarious random orientations, providing a rich informationfor training a neural network to predict the 3D structures.We then employ the pre-trained UpFusion model (which uti-lizes a conditional diffusion model for synthesizing novelviews) to train an instance-specific NeRF model for 3D re-construction. The performance of UpFusion is evaluatedthrough zero-shot predictions of 3D protein structures us-ing AFM images. The challenge, however, lies in the time-intensive and impractical nature of collecting actual AFMimages. To address this, we use a virtual AFM imaging pro-cess that transforms a PDB protein file into multi-view 2Dvirtual AFM images via volume rendering techniques. Weextensively validate the UpFusion architecture using bothvirtual and actual multi-view AFM images.Our resultsinclude a comparison of structures predicted with varyingnumbers of views and different sets of views. This novelapproach holds significant potential for enhancing the ac-curacy of protein complex structure predictions with furtherfine-tuning of the UpFusion network.",
  ". Introduction": "Accurately predicting the 3D structure of proteins fromtheir amino acid sequences has been a formidable challengefor the last 50 years .Predicting the 3D structure ofa protein is critically important because the structure dic- tates its function . Over the years, researchers have madeuse of and refined experimental techniques such as X-raycrystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spec-troscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to as-certain the 3D structures of proteins . Thesemethodological advancements have significantly increasedthe structural data available for numerous proteins. Con-currently, developments in deep learning (DL) have sig-nificantly influenced the field of protein structure predic-tion, exemplified by the creation of AlphaFold2 , ESM-Fold and RoseTTAFold . The integration of DL withbreakthroughs in cryo-EM imaging, particularly in single-particle analysis, has facilitated the elucidation of proteinstructures and their complexes. Nonetheless, cryo-EM im-ages often suffer from high noise levels, with signal-to-noise ratios reaching as low as -20 dB . Furthermore,conducting cryo-EM experiments is costly, with expensespotentially reaching up to $1,500 for each protein structureanalyzed .An alternative approach to deducing protein structuresinvolves establishing a relationship between a proteinsamino acid sequence and its corresponding structure. Thisstrategy encompasses techniques like Position SpecificScoring Matrices (PSSM) , which calculate the fre-quency distribution of mutations at each residue position,and Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), which identi-fies co-evolutionary patterns among sequences .Notably, AlphaFold2 leverages comprehensive MSAs anda template-based prediction process. However, its effec- Ground truth WRC WRAC prediction using AlphaFold2 multimer",
  ". UpFusion architecture for synthesizing novel views from unposed input images": "tiveness diminishes when it comes to predicting the struc-tures of protein complexes, where multiple proteins interactclosely. For instance, despite being tailored for the predic-tion of protein complexes, AlphaFold2-multimer strug-gles to accurately forecast the structure of the WRC pro-tein complex as seen in . Giventhe limitations of both in silico methods, which can failto predict the structure of protein complexes in certain in-stances, and the high costs and lengthy processes associ-ated with Cryo-EM, we suggest utilizing Deep Learning(DL) models trained on images obtained through AtomicForce Microscopy (AFM). AFM , falls un-der the umbrella of scanning probe microscopy and offersa non-destructive means to achieve high-resolution imagingof proteins under physiological conditions. This techniqueavoids the need for extensive sample preparation (such asfreezing, drying, or dye-tagging), which can compromisethe integrity of these delicate samples. With these advantages of AFM, we propose a novel ap-proach to infer the 3D structure of protein complexes usinga neural network trained using multi-view AFM images. Weuse UpFusion neural network architecture, which hasdemonstrated superior performance in synthesizing novelviews and inferring 3D structures. Specifically, it can ex-ploit its ability to reconstruct 3D models from unposed im-ages and generalize beyond the training categories. We ex-plain the details of the architecture in . We assessthe UpFusion architecture through a zero-shot approach forpredicting protein structures using AFM images. Despitehaving multiple actual AFM images of a WRC protein com-plex, using just one protein for validation does not suffi- ciently verify this method. To validate this method exten-sively we take use of a virtual AFM imaging pipeline. Eventhough AFM is not as expensive as Cryo-EM, experimen-tally acquiring the AFM images for large number proteins isnot practical. Hence, using a volume rendering technique,a virtual AFM imaging pipeline to generate multiple viewsof the proteins. We discuss this virtual imaging process indetail in . We show our preliminary results in Sec-tion 4. Finally, we conclude in with some futuredirections.",
  ". Method": "We leverage the pre-trained neural network called UpFu-sion, a novel system designed to perform two main tasks:novel view synthesis and inferring 3D representations ofobjects from a sparse set of reference images without corre-sponding pose information. This is a significant departurefrom traditional sparse-view 3D inference methods that relyon geometrically aggregating information from input viewsusing camera poses , which are often unavail-able or inaccurate in real-world scenarios. UpFusion over-comes this challenge by employing a conditional generativemodel that leverages the available images as context withoutrequiring explicit camera poses to synthesize novel views.The core methodology of UpFusion integrates two keycomponents: a scene-level transformer and a denoising dif-fusion model.The transformer, specifically an UnposedScene Representation Transformer (UpSRT) , is uti-lized to infer query-view aligned features by implicitly in-corporating all available input images as context. Condi-tioning a diffusion model with the internal representations",
  ". Virtual AFM: GPU-accelerated volume rendering of 3D voxelized protein structure to generate AFM-like virtual 2D images": "of UpSRT can generate novel views from sparse data, thusenabling probabilistic sparse view synthesis . To en-hance the specificity and relevance of the generated views,UpFusion incorporates shortcuts through attention mech-anisms in the diffusion process, allowing direct access toinput view features during generation. Although the conditional diffusion model we proposecan produce high-quality renderings from query views, itfails to ensure 3D consistency across the generated views.To achieve a coherent 3D representation (Neural radiancefield or NeRF) from the distribution inferred over newviews, it refines this process by optimizing an instance-specific neural representation . This optimization drawsinspiration from SparseFusion , which focuses on iden-tifying neural 3D structures by enhancing the likelihood oftheir renderings. This is achieved by adapting the ScoreDistillation Sampling (SDS) loss for use with view-conditioned generative models. The training of UpFusion involved a multi-stage proce-dure, starting with the training of the UpSRT model using areconstruction loss on the colors predicted for queried raysbased on a set of reference images, followed by training thedenoising diffusion model with conditioning informationfrom the pre-trained UpSRT. After training the diffusionmodel, it derives a 3D representation of an object throughthe optimization of an Instant-NGP . The NeRF istrained for 3000 iterations, which takes a around an houron an A100 GPU for a single protein sample. This processhighlights the importance of a systematic approach to train-ing complex models that combine the strengths of trans-formers and diffusion models for 3D inference and novelview synthesis.",
  ". Virtual AFM": "To conduct extensive evaluation of the UpFusion architec-ture we need AFM images for sufficiently large number ofproteins. Acquiring actual AFM images for a large numberof proteins is an impractical task. To solve this, we take useof a virtual AFM workflow for generating virtual multi-view AFM images from protein files in PDB format. Weutilize the AlphaFold DB , a database comprised ofpredictions made by the AlphaFold2 model on Swiss-Prot entries. Despite facing challenges in predicting proteincomplexes, AlphaFold2 excels in predicting the structureof individual proteins. Subsequently, we employ PyMol,a software frequently utilized for protein visualization, toconvert the PDB format structures into three-dimensionalmesh files in OBJ format. It is possible to visualize pro-teins in various visual forms, including surfaces, spheres,sticks, cartoons, or ribbons. For our purposes, we choose toexport the OBJ files depicting the surface representationsof the proteins. Following this, we apply a GPU-acceleratedalgorithm to voxelize the 3D mesh. We set the voxeliza-tion resolution at 256 voxels along the proteins longest di-mension and apply zero padding to the other dimensions toensure the voxelized structure achieves a uniform resolutionof 256 256 256.AFM generates a topographic image by scanning theprotein samples surface, delivering precise height map de-tails.The one of the most common colormaps used inAFM images is the hot colormap, which ranges fromblack (representing the lowest points) through reds and yel-lows to white (representing the highest points). This col-ormap is often used because it effectively highlights varia-tions in height across the surface being imaged, making iteasier to discern topographical features. In our methodol-ogy, we employ a GPU-accelerated volume rendering technique to produce 2D height-map projections from the Ground truth1 view6 views3 views",

To gather a multiple random views throughvirtual AFM, the 3D structure undergoes random rotationswithin the three-dimensional space, resulting in a collectionof multi-view images. For each protein structure we save25 random views, saved in a standard image format. More-over, our study extends to include high-resolution imagingat the nanometer scale of single molecules from the WRCprotein complex . Virtual AFM images ofthe WRC complex are also created.

  ". Results and Discussion": "We evaluate the zero-shot capability of 3D reconstructionsof the UpFusion network using both virtual and real un-posed AFM images. In , we present the outcomesfrom utilizing varying numbers of input views (e.g., 1V, 3V,and 6V), noting an improvement in 3D reconstruction qual-ity with an increase in the number of input images. Forquantitative assessment, we employ established metrics forimage reconstruction, including Peak Signal-to-Noise Ra-tio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) , andLearned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) .We perform a numerical analysis of the novel view synthe-sis for each protein depicted in . Subsequently, wecalculate the average of each metric across the protein sam-ples and present the results in . Consistent with thetrends observed in visualized predictions, we find that an in-creased number of input views enhances the quality of thesynthesized views.We also investigate how the choice of input views im-pacts prediction accuracy. To do this, we generate the 3Dpredictions by feeding different sets of views for a singleprotein. In this approach, we form two sets of various viewsof a protein as illustrated in . It is observed that, ingeneral, a more varied collection of views enhances the 3Dreconstruction, reducing the ambiguity arising from viewsthat appear similar.Further, we visualize the prediction made using actualAFM images of WRC protein complex and compare it withthe prediction from virtual AFM images in . Wesee both the prediction captures the high-level shape, but theprediction from the actual AFM image fails to capture theintricate details. We anticipate this result as these are just",
  ". Conclusions": "In this work, we validated the deep learning frame-workUpFusion, which is designed to generate the novelviews and 3D NeRF reconstruction, for the task of pro-tein structure prediction using AFM images.We utilizethe virtual AFM imaging pipeline, a GPU-accelerated vol-ume rendering technique that mimics the AFM imagingprocess, which facilitates the creation of virtual AFM-likeimages from PDB format protein files, which enabled usfor extensive evaluation using multiple protein samples. Wetested the efficacy of the UpFusion network by conductingzero-shot predictions on both actual and virtual AFM pro-tein images without requiring any model fine-tuning. TheUpFusion network exhibited promising capabilities in pre-dicting the 3D structure of proteins from unposed AFMimages. Future work will focus on refining the UpFusionarchitecture specifically for the protein structure predictiontask using AFM images. We anticipate that fine-tuning withextensive dataset comprising of virtual AFM images willsignificantly enhance the accuracy of 3D reconstructions.",
