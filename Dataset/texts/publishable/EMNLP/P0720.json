  "Abstract": "Despite significant advancements in natural lan-guage generation, controlling language modelsto produce texts with desired attributes remainsa formidable challenge. In this work, we intro-duce RSA-Control, a training-free controllabletext generation framework grounded in prag-matics. RSA-Control directs the generationprocess by recursively reasoning between imag-inary speakers and listeners, enhancing the like-lihood that target attributes are correctly inter-preted by listeners amidst distractors. Addition-ally, we introduce a self-adjustable rationalityparameter, which allows for automatic adjust-ment of control strength based on context. Ourexperiments, conducted with two task typesand two types of language models, demonstratethat RSA-Control achieves strong attribute con-trol while maintaining language fluency andcontent consistency.

  "Introduction": "Controllable text generation (CTG) focuses on pro-ducing natural language texts with specified at-tributes, such as sentiment and readability. Thiscapability is vital for developing functional and re-liable natural language generation (NLG) systems.For instance, dialogue systems must be regulated toconsistently generate responses that are low in tox-icity and bias (Gehman et al., 2020; Kumar et al.,2023; Sheng et al., 2021). Similarly, summariza-tion systems are expected to be able to create cus-tomized summaries for different users by adjustingreadability (Ribeiro et al., 2023).Many existing studies in CTG rely on fine-tuningpre-trained language models (PLMs) on attribute-specific datasets (Keskar et al., 2019; Gururan-gan et al., 2020). However, due to the increas-ing scale of PLMs, fine-tuning them has becomeresource-intensive. Decoding-based methods thatnavigate the PLM decoding process using guide modules (Dathathri et al., 2020; Yang and Klein,2021; Krause et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) haveachieved strong attribute control and reduced theneed to fine-tune PLMs, but still require additionaldatasets and computational resources for trainingthe guide modules. Besides, introducing externalcomponents could potentially hurt coherence dur-ing decoding (Xu et al., 2021). As large-scalePLMs become more adept at understanding humaninstructions (Touvron et al., 2023; Achiam et al.,2023), prompt-based methods have emerged as alightweight way to adapt PLMs to new domains(Brown et al., 2020; Schick and Schtze, 2021).Previous research has explored direct prompting(Mattern et al., 2022) and using auxiliary prompts(Schick et al., 2021; Leong et al., 2023; Yona et al.,2023) for CTG. Nonetheless, due to the black-boxnature of PLMs, precise control via prompt-basedmethods is still challenging and often leads to un-expected outputs (Zhang et al., 2023).In this work, we introduce RSA-Control, anovel CTG method that bridges decoding-basedand prompt-based paradigms through the computa-tional pragmatic framework of Rational SpeechActs (RSA) (Frank and Goodman, 2012). TheRSA framework elucidates the effective and ef-ficient human communication through a mutualreasoning process: speakers adjust their utterancesby reasoning about listeners perceptions, whilelisteners, in turn, infer the speakers intentions.Inspired by RSAs success in modeling conver-sational behaviors, our approach explicitly mod-els the interactions between speaker and listenermodules, enabling a pragmatic speaker to generateutterances that ensure the accurate perception ofdesired attributes by the listeners. As illustratedin , RSA-Control constructs a guide mod-ule (pragmatic listener L1) using PLMs with auxil-iary control prompts (literal speaker S0) to achievecontrollable decoding of the pragmatic speakerS1. By replacing fine-tuned discriminator mod- : Illustration of RSA-Control for generatingreadable summaries. Since S0 assigns higher/lowerprobability to \"sick\" than \"bedridden\" when conditionedon readable/formal prompts, L1 can infer that \"sick\" ismore readable than \"bedridden\". S1 then selects nexttokens that are both readable and consistent with articlecontent. Specifically, it first decodes with basic rational-ity 0, and the outputs are fed back into PLM and L1 tocompute a self-adjusted rationality parameter n. Thereal decoding process is then performed with n. ules with prompted PLMs, RSA-Control combinesthe robust control of decoding-based methods withthe efficiency of training-free prompt-based ap-proaches. Furthermore, instead of using a fixedcontrol strength, we introduce a self-adjustable ra-tionality parameter to better balance attribute con-trol and information conveyance.We apply RSA-Control to different CTG tasktypes and PLMs to showcase its efficacy. In Sec-tion 4 and , we reduce toxicity and stereo-typical bias in open-ended generation with GPT2,a foundation model lacking instruction-followingabilities. In , we control Llama-2-7b-chat, an instruction-tuned model, for readability-controlled summarization. Unlike open-ended gen-eration which has no content constraints, the sum-marization task involves an input-output processwhere PLMs receive detailed documents and pro-duce summaries that capture salient informationfrom the input content. Therefore, we categorizeit as an input-output task. Experimental resultsacross both types of tasks and PLMs show thatour approach successfully generates texts that sat-isfy desired attributes while maintaining languagefluency and content adherence.",
  "Fine-tuning MethodsAlongside the success ofPLMs in generating coherent natural language": "texts, studies on controlling attributes in generationhave also emerged (Zhang et al., 2023). Amongvarious methods, the most straightforward involvesadapting models to specific domains. Gururanganet al. (2020) demonstrate that further training onattribute-specific datasets can improve the capac-ity of PLMs in these areas. Similar approacheshave been employed to reduce toxicity (Arora et al.,2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023), con-trol language styles (Ficler and Goldberg, 2017;Zhang and Song, 2022), and align PLMs with hu-man preferences (Ziegler et al., 2019; Wei et al.,2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). Nevertheless, thesemethods are computationally expensive, especiallygiven the ever-larger scale of current PLMs. Decoding-based MethodsAnother line of work,known as decoding-based methods, employs ex-ternal components to navigate PLM decoding(Yang and Klein, 2021; Meng et al., 2022; Zhangand Wan, 2023; Dekoninck et al., 2024). PPLM(Dathathri et al., 2020) trains attribute classifiersand updates hidden states of PLMs with their gra-dients to orient the generation towards desired at-tributes. GeDi (Krause et al., 2021) uses gener-ative classifiers with class conditional languagemodels to guide decoding. Similarly, DExperts(Liu et al., 2021) leverages expert and anti-expertmodules to modify model logits. Energy-basedmodels apply multiple modular constraints dur-ing decoding to enforce lexical or attribute control(Qin et al., 2022; Mireshghallah et al., 2022). Al-though decoding-based methods avoid fine-tuningPLMs, they still require training auxiliary mod-ules on attribute-specific datasets. In contrast, ourmethod replaces fine-tuned modules with promptedPLMs, eliminating the need for data collection andmodel training. Additionally, introducing externalcomponents can risk compromising language abil-ities and encoded knowledge of PLMs (Xu et al.,2021), whereas our approach relies solely on thePLMs themselves. Prompt-based MethodsThe advent of large lan-guage models (Brown et al., 2020; Raffel et al.,2020; Achiam et al., 2023) has enabled the adap-tation of models to new tasks using only naturallanguage task descriptions (Puri and Catanzaro,2019; Schick and Schtze, 2021). However, di-rectly prompting PLMs to control attributes hasshown poor performance in foundation models(Mattern et al., 2022). As a result, various methodshave been proposed to extend the prompt-based framework (Wingate et al., 2022; Pozzobon et al.,2023a; Pei et al., 2023), and RSA-Control alsofalls within this paradigm due to its training-freenature. For example, Leong et al. (2023) identifyand reverse toxification directions in two succes-sive forward passes during inference. In the initialpass, negative and positive prompts are prependedto inputs to determine the direction of each atten-tion head from positive to negative generation. Inthe subsequent pass, they adjust each attention headto the reversed direction to mitigate toxicity. Themost similar work to ours is Self-Debias (Schicket al., 2021) which identifies toxic token candidateswith negative prompts and suppresses their prob-abilities for detoxification. Compared to earlierprompt-based methods, our proposed RSA-Controlapproach explicitly incorporates speaker and lis-tener modules to model the generation and percep-tion of utterances. This interaction between speakerand listener modules leads to enhanced attributecontrol and automatic control strength adjustment,as illustrated in the example provided in .",
  "Rational Speech Acts Framework": "The Rational Speech Acts framework is a compu-tational pragmatic model that involves mutual rea-soning between speakers and listeners about eachothers intentions and interpretations (Frank andGoodman, 2012). This framework has been suc-cessfully applied to explain complex pragmatic phe-nomena in human languages (Lassiter and Good-man, 2013; Kao et al., 2014a,b). Recently, RSAhas been adapted to improve informativeness in var-ious NLG tasks (Andreas and Klein, 2016; Cohn-Gordon et al., 2018, 2019; Cohn-Gordon and Good-man, 2019; Shen et al., 2019), and Kim et al. (2020,2021) exploit RSA to enhance persona and emo-tion consistency in dialogue systems. Nevertheless,its application to CTG remains underexplored. Inthis work, we investigate how RSA can improveattribute control in NLG tasks and extend the frame-work for automatic control strength adjustment byintroducing a self-adjustable rationality parameter.",
  "Task Formulation": "Given input content c and desired attribute a, thegoal of CTG is to generate a sequence W thatis fluent and adheres to c while demonstrating a.In practice, W is typically generated incremen-tally, with the modeling of next token probabil- ities conditioned on the previously generated to-kens. Thus, the task of CTG can be formulatedas modeling P(wn|w<n, c, a) and then samplingan utterance W from the conditional distributionP(w1:N|c, a) = Nn=1 P(wn|w<n, c, a).Depending on the task type, the input contentc can vary: in open-ended generation, c is emptyand the generation is solely conditioned on a andpreviously generated tokens w<n; in input-outputtasks such as summarization, c can include task in-structions, input documents and other task-specificcomponents.",
  "PS1(wn|w<n, c, a) exp(U(wn|w<n, c, a)) (1)": "We decompose U into two parts: a content util-ity function Uc and an attribute utility functionUa which account for different goals. Uc ensuresconsistency with content c, while Ua conveys thedesired attribute a. Given that PLMs excel at gen-erating coherent texts but struggle with attributecontrol, we implement Uc with a PLM and defineUa in an RSA manner, i.e., as the log probabil-ity that an imaginary pragmatic listener can infera amidst predefined distractor attributes. Impor-tantly, we assume conditional independence in Uabetween content c and attribute a given wn, as thelistener is often unaware of c in a conversation. Forexample, a listener generally does not know whicharticles a speaker is summarizing. This assump-tion explicitly integrates a theory of mind abilityinto our framework, allowing speakers to tailortheir utterances based on the listeners knowledge(De Weerd et al., 2013; Kosinski, 2023). Conse-quently, Ua is designed to be independent of c, andthe two utility functions are modeled as follows:",
  "=PS0(wn | w<n, a) PL1(a | w<n)aA PS0(wn | w<n, a) PL1(a | w<n)(6)": "where A is the union of target and distractor at-tributes. Intuitively, L1 updates its belief aboutattributes after seeing wn at each step. The priorbelief at step 0 is defined as an uninformative uni-form distribution over all candidate attributes.At the end of recursion, a literal speaker S0generates utterances given different candidate at-tributes. Previous research shows that PLMs en-code concepts of attributes during pre-training andcan recognize them when instructed with prompts(Schick et al., 2021; Wang and Chang, 2022), there-fore we implement S0 using PLMs paired with con-trol prompts encouraging each candidate attribute:",
  "PS0(wn|w<n, a) = PLM(wn|w<n, prompta) (7)": "Note that although our method bears similar-ity to Bayesian CTG frameworks with generativeclassifiers (e.g., GeDi), it is distinct from existingwork in two aspects: (1) Instead of using generativemodels fine-tuned on candidate attribute domains,we prompt a PLM to act as S0; (2) We assumeconditional independence between content c andattribute a given wn, reflected by the design thatUa is conditioned only on a and not on c. Weshow in that this is critical for successfulcontrol in input-output tasks. Additionally, whilemultiple reasoning recursions (e.g., modeling L2 and S2 based on S1) are possible (Franke and De-gen, 2016), our results in Appendix F indicate thatadditional layers have effects similar to increasingspeaker rationality, aligning with findings from hu-man communication studies (Frank, 2016). Forthe sake of decoding efficiency, we model onlyone layer of mutual reasoning and report the CTGperformance of S1.",
  "Self-Adjustable Rationality": "Most existing CTG methods use the same con-trol strength at each decoding step, leading toeither excessive or insufficient constraints andthereby sub-optimal performance.Inspired bythe concept of variable rationality in Zarrieand Schlangen (2019), we argue that introducingcontext-dependent control strength is essential forbalancing attribute control and content consistency.Hence, we propose a more flexible approach calledself-adjustable rationality, which achieves auto-matic adjustment of control strength.Instead of utilizing a fixed rationality parameter throughout the generation process, we adopt avariable which can take different values withinthe range [0, 0 + 1] at each time step n. Thevalue of is determined by the extent to which con-tent consistency and attribute control are achievedwith the basic rationality 0 and additional ratio-nality up to 1 are allowed to be added as needed.Specifically, we compute two ratios, rcn and ran:",
  "PL1(a|wn,n=0, w<n)(9)": "Here rcn and ran reflect how well the generated to-kens adhere to the input content and how likely L1can recognize the desired attribute, respectively, bycomparing decoding with n = 0 and n = 0(no control). Since wn has not yet been generated,we choose the top 5 tokens with the highest proba-bilities to simulate wn. Then n is computed as:",

  "Toxicity Reduction": "PLMs are at risk of learning toxic and offensivecontent from their training data (Gehman et al.,2020; Kumar et al., 2023), hence it is crucial tomitigate these risks before deploying them. Weapply RSA-Control to GPT2 (Radford et al., 2019),a family of foundation models with sizes rangingfrom 117M to 1.5B parameters, aiming to steerthem towards producing safer outputs.We conduct our toxicity reduction experi-ments on the RealToxicityPrompts (RTP) dataset(Gehman et al., 2020). The RTP dataset comprises100K prompts from web data, some of which leadto toxic continuations. The examined PLMs per-form open-ended generation conditioned on RTPprompts without content constraints, and the toxic-ity of each continuation is measured by the Perspec-tive API1. Specifically, Perspective API predicts ascore between 0 and 1 for six attributes: toxicity,severe toxicity, sexually explicit, threat, profanity,and identity attack, indicating the probability thatthe continuation exhibits each attribute. We usethe challenging subset of RTP which contains 1199strongly toxic prompts. BaselinesFor the evaluation of RSA-Control, weinclude baselines of various types: DAPT (Guru-rangan et al., 2020): a fine-tuning method whichfurther trains GPT2 on non-toxic datasets; GeDi(Krause et al., 2021) and DExperts (Liu et al., 2021): two decoding-based methods that leveragefine-tuned external modules; Self-Detoxify (Leonget al., 2023) and Self-Debias (Schick et al., 2021):two prompt-based methods that utilize auxiliaryprompts. The first three methods require additionaldatasets and training, while the last two as wellas our method are training-free. We also reportthe results of a vanilla model and a vanilla modelprompted by the target prompt. More details aboutbaseline models are provided in Appendix C.",
  "Experimental SetupWe follow Schick et al": "(2021) to simultaneously reduce all six toxicityattributes. The descriptions of each attribute usedto create control prompts are detailed in AppendixA. Six distractor prompts are constructed by fill-ing each attribute description into template 1b in, and a prompt (1a) encouraging safe out-puts serves as the target prompt. For all modelsizes, GPT2-small is used for modeling S0, as it re-sults in the best average toxicity detection accuracyof L1 on six attributes (75.65%), comparable to afine-tuned generative classifier (see Appendix B fordetailed results and discussions). One continuationwith 20 tokens is generated for each prompt usingbeam search with a beam size of 3. Automatic EvaluationWe measure the propor-tion of continuations exhibiting each toxicity at-tribute, indicated by a score from Perspective APIgreater than 0.5.

Self-Detoxify obtains lower PPL, it substantiallyfalls short of RSA-Control in reducing toxicity withthe poorest performance among detoxified mod-els. RSA-Control also achieves better detoxifica-tion than DAPT without any training. Decoding-based methods, GeDi and DExperts, are the mosteffective at mitigating toxicity, albeit at the cost ofhigher PPL than other paradigms. Directly prompt-ing GPT2 with the target prompt induces moretoxicity, likely because non-toxic prompts (e.g., thetext is non-toxic:) are often followed by sentencesthat can be (mis)interpreted as toxic in the PLMtraining data (Schick et al., 2021). We show in Ap-pendix D that RSA-Control effectively detoxifiesGPT2 of various sizes and compare incrementalwith sample-based RSA in Appendix G.

The higherPPL of RSA-Control, relative to vanilla GPT-2 andSelf-Detoxify, is due to its lower coherence. Since the RealToxicityPrompts dataset contains highlytoxic content and is difficult to detoxify, we believethat effective CTG systems must deviate from theoriginal topic and style of the prompts to achievedetoxification, which explains their lower coher-ence scores.",

  "Bias Mitigation": "PLMs are also prone to inheriting stereotypicalbiases against certain social groups during pre-training (Blodgett et al., 2020; Sheng et al., 2021).To address this issue, we apply RSA-Control tomitigate these biases and assess its effectivenessusing the CrowS-Pairs benchmark (Nangia et al.,2020). CrowS-Pairs features pairs of minimallydifferent sentences, with one being stereotypicaland the other being anti-stereotypical (e.g., \"Mymom spent all day cooking for Thanksgiving\" vs.\"My dad spent all day cooking for Thanksgiving\").The proportion of instances where a PLM assignshigher probabilities to stereotypical sentences isreported, and a score closer to 50 indicates lessbias. Nine types of social biases are covered by CrowS-Pairs: race/color, gender, socioeconomicstatus/occupation, nationality, religion, age, sex-ual orientation, physical appearance, and disability.Templates 2a and 2b from filled with thename of each bias type are used as target and dis-tractor prompts. We compare RSA-Control with to vanilla GPT2 and Self-Debias. shows the results of bias mitigation forGPT2-large. RSA-Control demonstrates superiorperformance in reducing stereotypical bias com-pared to both GPT2-large and Self-Debias. No-tably, it exhibits the lowest degree of bias in 8 outof 9 bias types. The bias reduction is statisticallysignificant in race, occupation categories over thevanilla model and in disability over Self-Debias.In Appendix H we show that RSA-Control con-sistently outperforms baseline models across allmodel sizes.",
  "Readability-Controlled Summarization": "We then apply RSA-Control to enhance readabilitycontrol in instruction-tuned PLMs for news sum-marization, an input-output task. Generating sum-maries with desired readability levels ensures theextracted information is accessible to readers withvarying literacy proficiency (Goldsack et al., 2022,2023; Pu et al., 2024). While most studies rely onadditional model training to steer summarization(Cao and Wang, 2021; Goyal et al., 2022; Luo et al.,2022; Ribeiro et al., 2023), large-scale PLMs haveshown the capability of generating summaries in de-sired styles following natural language instructions(Pu and Demberg, 2023; Rooein et al., 2023). Thus,we adopt Llama-2-7b-chat (Touvron et al., 2023, hereafter referred to as Llama-2) for readability-controlled summarization, aiming to improve itscontrol results beyond direct prompting. UnlikeGPT2, Llama-2 is instruction-tuned (Ziegler et al.,2019), making it more capable of following hu-man instructions. For this experiment, we use theCNN/DailyMail (CNN/DM) (Hermann et al., 2015)test set which consists of 11490 news articles.We adapt Llama-2 for default summarizationby prepending an instruction to each news article(3a in ). As shown by Pu and Demberg(2023), the style of summaries can be controlled byspecifying readability levels in the prompt. Conse-quently, we enhance the content utility function Ucin Equation 2 with desired attributes a for readabil-ity control by indicating target audiences in instruc-tions (3b and 3c), following Rooein et al. (2023).This baseline approach is called Prompt. We thenapply RSA-Control to the Prompt baseline and ori-ent its decoding with control prompts 3d and 3e(Prompt+RSA). The control prompts are createdby referring to readable and formal genres and tar-geting specific audiences, and they are designed toexclude summarization task instructions and inputarticles, in line with the definition of Ua in Equa-tion 3. When generating readable summaries, weset 3d as target prompt and 3e as distractor promptto further increase readability, and their roles areswapped for formal summarization.

Results are based on 200 examplesand averaged over 3 runs on an A100 GPU (80GB).RSA-Control is approximately 17.9% slower than directprompting and incurs a 22.7% increase in memory costs. Another limitation involves using the black-boxPerspective API for toxicity evaluation. As notedby Pozzobon et al. (2023b), the Perspective APIis not static and its frequent updates make it chal-lenging to reproduce the same results. Additionally,Schick et al. (2021) show it could produce inaccu-rate predictions. Besides, while RSA-Control improves attributecontrol performance, it often leads to a decrease inautomatic metrics of text quality. We believe thatthis decline is mainly due to variations in style andtopic, which are crucial for effective attribute con-trol. However, we recommend users remain awareof this trade-off when applying RSA-Control.Finally, RSA-Control assumes that PLMs haveencoded knowledge of attributes during their pre-training. However, because the training data andmethodologies for PLMs can vary, the extent towhich they capture nuanced concepts can differas well, potentially leading to inconsistent controlresults across different PLMs (see Appendix L forfurther discussion).

In this work, we have demonstratedits potential to mitigate toxicity and stereotypicalbias in PLMs. However, toxicity and bias are com-plex and deep-rooted issues, not only within theNLP community but also in the broader world.Therefore, our experiments with human-curatedbenchmarks and predefined types of toxicity andbias may not fully capture the entire scope of theseproblems. Furthermore, our proposed method, likeany CTG approach, carries the risk of misuse togenerate more hateful and biased texts. We hencestrongly encourage careful moral considerationsbefore deploying our methods in NLP systems.",

  "BPragmatic Listener Results": "For each attribute in , we collect 1000 con-tinuations that have the highest and lowest scoresfrom Perspective API. Then these 2000 examplesare assigned positive and negative labels based onwhether their attribute scores are greater than 0.5.To model L1, we implement S0 using contrastivecontrol prompts formatted as \"The following sen-tences contain [BLANK],\" where descriptions ofeach toxicity type and their antonyms in AppendixA are filled in [BLANK] to create toxic and non-toxic prompts. A sample is predicted to exhibitan attribute by L1 if its likelihood conditioned onthe toxic prompt is higher than its likelihood con-ditioned on the non-toxic prompt. For comparison,we report the performance of a fine-tuned genera-tive classifier implemented using expert and anti-expert modules from DExperts (Liu et al., 2021).",
  ": Abilities of pragmatic listener L1 in identify-ing six toxicity attributes and average performance": "The results in illustrate that L1, withoutany additional fine-tuning, achieves a competitiveaverage classification accuracy of approximately75% across model sizes, comparable to fine-tunedgenerative classifiers. In addition, a negative cor-relation between model size and classification per-formance is observed. Manual inspection suggeststhat larger models may overfit the descriptions inprompts, tending to assign high toxicity/nontoxicprobabilities to sentences containing words that areexplicitly present in the toxic/nontoxic prompts.Conversely, lower scores are predicted when thesewords are replaced with semantically similar onesnot included in the prompts. Considering both per-formance and efficiency, we utilize GPT2-small toact as S0 to detoxify all models. This approachaligns with existing methods that use smaller mod-els as guide modules (Krause et al., 2021; Liu et al.,2021).",
  "CImplementation Details": "In the toxicity reduction and bias mitigation experi-ments, we implement DAPT by fine-tuning GPT2models of various sizes following the setup fromLiu et al. (2021). For GeDi and DExperts, weuse checkpoints released in their github reposito-ries and adopt = 1.0 and = 1.6 for decod-ing, respectively, as the hyperparameters in theirwork yield unreadable generations on RTP withextremely high PPL. For Self-Detoxify and Self-Debias, we adopt the same implementation and hyperparameters as in the original papers.In the readability-controlled summarization task,we use Dynamic Word Unit Prediction released byCao and Wang (2021). As no checkpoint for Con-trollable Readability is provided and the trainingis too computationally expensive, we report resultsfrom the original work (Ribeiro et al., 2023).",
  "EToxicity Reduction and Self-AdjustableRationality Examples": "We provide more examples of RSA-Control in tox-icity reduction experiments in . In the firsttwo examples, RSA-Control successfully reducestoxicity while the other two fail. In the third exam-ple, both Self-Debias and RSA-Control avoid toxiccontinuations. All three models have very toxicgenerations in the last example.Examples of continuations from RSA-Controlwith fixed and self-adjustable rationality parame-ters are given in . In the self-adjustablerationality examples, numbers following each worddenote the value of at this step. For words thatcan be decoded into multiple tokens, the high-est is reported. In the first two examples, self-adjustable rationality achieves a better balance be-tween reducing toxicity and maintaining fluency.In the third example, it produces less toxic continu-ations compared to both low and high fixed ratio-nality parameters. However, all three models failto reduce toxicity in the final example. We observethat takes the minimum value at most positions,and it increases when generating nouns or verbsthat significantly affect the semantic meaning of asentence. Additionally, it takes larger values at thebeginning of new clauses and sentences to guidethe overall direction of the sentence. In the finalexample, although self-adjustable rationality doesnot improve over fixed low rationality, it still pro-vides additional control strength when toxic tokensare generated. Therefore, we conclude that self-adjustable rationality can detect when additionalrationality is needed and adjust control strength",

  "FRE BS RG-L": "Article: The National Trust has replaced antique furniture with beanbags at one of its historichomes in an experiment which has enraged heritage experts. Furniture dating back to 1820was moved from the library at Ickworth House in Suffolk earlier this year and replaced with fourbrown leatherette bean bags. The move was designed to encourage visitors to dwell and take inthe atmosphere in the room but it provoked fury from heritage expects who branded the movemisguided. The National Trust has replaced antique furniture with beanbags in the library ofIckworth House, Suffolk . Now it has emerged that similar experiments will take place at nineother of its venues around the country. Art historian Bendor Grosvenor, whose blog post on hisArt History News site about Ickworth sparked the controversy, told The Independent: I suspectthe hoo-ha about the beanbags may at least cause them rethink what they were going to do. TheNational Trust said the beanbag experiment was short-term Pictured: Ickworth House, Suffolk . Idont think youll ever bring in a new audience by talking down to it. Experimentation and bringingin new audiences are marvellous but there are better ways of doing it by taking away things peoplemight want to see. Its patronising nonsense. The National Trusts director of strategy, curatorshipand external affairs Simon Murray told The Art Newspaper that the Trust presents each housein context and that each is different and treated appropriately. He said: We are not a museumthat takes objects, shows them in a display case, shines a light on them and labels them.
