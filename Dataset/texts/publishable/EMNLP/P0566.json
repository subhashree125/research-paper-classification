  "Abstract": "Large language models are susceptible to jail-break attacks, which can result in the genera-tion of harmful content. While prior defensesmitigate these risks by perturbing or inspect-ing inputs, they ignore competing objectives,the underlying cause of alignment failures. Inthis paper, we propose Alignment-EnhancedDecoding (AED), a novel defense that employsadaptive decoding to address the root causes ofjailbreak issues. We first define the CompetitiveIndex to quantify alignment failures and utilizefeedback from self-evaluation to compute post-alignment logits. Then, AED adaptively com-bines Competitive Index and post-alignmentlogits with the original logits to obtain harm-less and helpful distributions. Consequently,our method enhances safety alignment whilemaintaining helpfulness. We conduct exper-iments across five models and four commonjailbreaks, with the results validating the effec-tiveness of our approach. Code is available at",
  "Introduction": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasinglybeing applied across various domains (Bommasaniet al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2023). Given the maliciouscontent in pre-training datasets, alignments are im-plemented to ensure these models are helpful andharmless.(Penedo et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2020). Despite efforts in align-ment, jailbreak attacks can circumvent safety mea-sures, resulting in undesirable outcomes (Zou et al.,2023; Liu et al., 2023a; Chao et al., 2023; Zhouet al., 2024).Current defenses against jailbreaks primarily in-volve perturbation of jailbreaks or detecting thesafety of inputs. Perturbation defenses focus oncountering jailbreak attacks through input modifica-tion. (Jain et al., 2023; Robey et al., 2023; Liu et al.,",

The distribution for harmless queries remainsunchanged (left), whereas the distribution for maliciousqueries undergoes correction (right). 2024; Wei et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Detec-tion method aims to inspect and categorize input asharmful or safe content, such as perplexity-basedclassification (Alon and Kamfonas, 2023; Jainet al., 2023; Phute et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2023).However, existing defenses lack efficiency be-cause they ignore the underlying causes of jail-breaks. One explanation for alignment failure is thepresence of competing objectives outlined by Weiet al. (2024). Competing objectives arise whenthere is a balance between helpful performance",
  "tSS": ": Pipeline of the decoding process depicted with and without AED intervention, addressing the same harmfulquery: the top sequence demonstrates standard decoding, while the bottom sequence illustrates the AED process:Step 1 involves obtaining the probability distribution of the next token; Step 2 computes the Competitive Index,which reflects the degree of competitions; and Step 3 realigns the distribution to ensure a safe and ethical response. and adhering to harmless principles. This competi-tion may cause a model to prioritize helpful objec-tives over harmless when confronted with jailbreakprompts, leading to the failure of safety measures. In this work, we present Alignment-EnhancedDecoding (AED), a novel defense that employsadaptive decoding to refine the probability distri-bution of each token (see ). Specifically, wedefine the Competitive Index to quantify the com-peting objectives of the model and to represent therisk of the model being jailbroken. Subsequently,we obtain the self-evaluation of the model in whichwe use the generated output as an auxiliary input toderive the post-alignment logits. When predictingthe next token, AED adaptively refines the origi-nal logits based on the Competitive Index and thepost-alignment logits. Therefore, AED ensures thateach step of the decoding process adheres to harm-less goals without additional training. In addition,AED is adaptive to maintain the helpfulness to rou-tine queries. We perform comprehensive experiments acrossfive popular open-source large language models,including Llama2-7B-Chat-HF (Touvron et al.,2023), Llama3-8B-Instruct (Meta, 2024), Vicuna-7B (Chiang et al., 2023), Guanaco-7B (Dettmerset al., 2024), and Gemma-1.1-7B-IT (Team et al., 2024). Experimental results show that AED effec-tively counters a range of sophisticated jailbreakattacks such as GCG (Zou et al., 2023) , Auto-Dan (Liu et al., 2023a), ICD (Wei et al., 2023), andRefusal_Suppression (Wei et al., 2024). Addition-ally, AED maintains helpfulness on general queriesin harmless datasets, including MMLU (Hendryckset al., 2020a), GMS8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), and Al-paca (for Research on Foundation Models, 2023).To summarize our contributions:",
  "Alignment.Incorporating vast amounts of datafrom the internet, datasets, such as MassiveText,": "contain elements of inconsistent quality (Rae et al.,2021). When used for pre-training, these datasetscan cause models to deviate from safety stan-dards (Hendrycks et al., 2020a; Brown et al.,2020; Devlin et al., 2018). In this context, align-ment becomes crucial, referring to the essentialcalibration of pre-trained models to align with hu-man values (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al.,2022; Bai et al., 2022; Glaese et al., 2022). Jailbreak Attacks.Despite efforts to enhancealignment, large language models (LLMs) remainvulnerable to jailbreak attacks (Wolf et al., 2023),where strategically crafted prompts can lead to thegeneration of undesired outputs. The developmentof jailbreak attacks has undergone an iterative pro-gression, shifting from manually executed strate-gies (Liu et al., 2023b; Perez and Ribeiro, 2022) tomore sophisticated automated methods (Zou et al.,2023; Liu et al., 2023a). Defenses.Large language models (LLMs) neces-sitate robust defenses, which primarily manifest intwo forms: Perturbation, Binary Classification.Perturbation techniques modify the original in-puts in ways that aim to compromise the integrity ofthe attack. Jain et al.s (2023) method of paraphras-ing includes transformations at both the sentencelevel and token level. Robey et al.s (2023) perturba-tion strategy involves randomly altering characterswithin words at the character-level and voting forresponses from perturbed copies. Wei et al. (2023)and Zhang et al. (2024) use prompts that includestandard question-and-answer interactions.Binary classification tasks assess whether inputsor outputs are harmful. One method involves us-ing perplexity-based metrics to detect jailbreakattacks (Alon and Kamfonas, 2023; Jain et al.,2023; Zou et al., 2023).Large language mod-els (LLMs) can be regarded as a binary classifier,wherein the output is preceded by the query Is itharmful? to elicit a classification response (Phuteet al., 2024). Kumar et al., 2023 proposed approachinvolves employing an additional filter to scrutinizeevery substring within a given sentence.",

The threshold Itis set at 1. For clarity, data are preprocessed by cappingindices exceeding twice the threshold at this upper limit. two distinct answers oriented to different objec-tives. For instance, when an LLM is compromisedthrough a jailbreak attack, the candidate tokens mayinclude conflicting responses such as Sure andSorry. Consequently, these trade-offs becomevulnerabilities that can be exploited in jailbreak at-tacks, such as Catastrophic jailbreak (Huang et al.,2023). In the study by Wei et al. (2024), these trade-offs were further discussed under the framework ofCompeting Objectives.Due to Competing Objectives, the number ofsemantically opposing candidate tokens increaseswhen considering the main candidates that collec-tively represent 90% of the total probability. Giventhis unusual increase in high-probability candidatesets, we adopt top-p sampling.

As for harmless datasets andthe calculation of St, we chose three popular bench-marks including MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020b),GMS8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), and Alpaca (Duboiset al., 2024).

The inclusion of system prompts leads to a noticeable shift of the Index towardzero, indicating a decrease in the degree of competition. Competitive Index Changes Under Harmlessand Jailbreak Queries.Observations reveal thatthe Competitive Index I exhibits significant differ-ences from harmless inputs under jailbreak attacks.Specifically, I often reaches or exceeds a thresh-old of two, contrasting sharply with its behaviorin harmless datasets, where values typically hoveraround zero. This trend underscores a marked devi-ation when the model is exposed to jailbreak inputs.In the case of the Vicuna model under AutoDANattacks, the percentage of indices surpassing thisthreshold reaches 82.73%. Additionally, most ofthese capped entries constitute at least 37% of thedata, highlighting the indexs effectiveness in dis-tinguishing between routine and harmful inputs. Competitive Index Changes Under Different In-put Settings.The Competitive Index I is sensi-tive to changes in input settings, such as the intro-duction of system prompts. As depicted in ,incorporating system prompts leads to a noticeabledecrease in the degree of competition. For example,in the Llama2-7B-Chat-HF model under a GCGattack (Zou et al., 2023), the proportion of I valuesexceeding the threshold st decreases significantlyfrom 75.5% to 41.5% with the introduction of a sys-tem prompt.

For instance, in the Llama2model, the NRR changed minimally from 2.5% to3.0% for MMLU, indicating that AED preservesthe models functionality. A notable performanceis observed in the Llama3, where the NRR forthe Alpaca dataset remained unchanged, affirmingthat AEDs implementation does not degrade themodels responsiveness in control settings.

  "Time Overhead of AED": "We evaluated AED alongside three defensive mech-anisms across five models. Tab. 2 shows that AEDdoes not incur significant additional computationalcosts. This assessment involved testing each de-fense with ten jailbreak scenarios and ten harmlessqueries.

In summary, these experiments establish that theCompetitive Index accurately measures the degreeof competition and is responsive to input variations.Additionally, our findings confirm that AED effec-tively defends against jailbreak attacks. It is alsodemonstrated that AED does not compromise themodels efficacy in standard question-answeringtasks. Then, the ATGR suggests that AED intro-duces minimal additional computational overhead.",

Utilizing e CompetitiveIndex I and the self-evaluation capabilities of themodel, we introduce a novel defensive AED thatadaptively refines the token distribution during pre-diction. This method is validated across five differ-ent models and tested against four jailbreak attacks, confirming its efficacy. Through comparative stud-ies, we demonstrate that AED surpasses existingdefenses in effectiveness and achieves this with-out necessitating additional training. Furthermore,according to the Average Time Generation Ratio(ATGR), AED introduces no significant increase intime overhead, confirming its efficiency and practi-cality.",
  "Limitations": "In this study, we differentiate between harmlessand jailbreak samples to analyze the CompetitiveIndex. However, we do not investigate why dispari-ties in the index exist within jailbreak samples, withsome reaching up to 100 times the threshold. Fur-thermore, variations in the index across differentmodels are noted but not extensively explored, sug-gesting that model architecture and training datamay influence these differences. Future researchcould further examine these factors to enhance un-derstanding of the Competitive Indexs utility inevaluating model performance.",
  "Ethics Impact": "This paper focuses on the domain of model security,specifically addressing some underlying causes ofalignment failures and proposing effective defensemechanisms against jailbreak attacks. While theresearch inherently involves sensitive topics, in-cluding the potential generation of harmful con-tent, we have taken rigorous measures to ensurethe ethical handling of such issues. Specifically,the potentially harmful content discussed withinthis study is abstracted or represented in alternativeways; no explicit jailbreak attack prompts are dis-played. By providing a robust defense method, thisresearch aims to enhance the security of large mod-els, thereby contributing positively to the broaderfield of AI safety and ensuring that the advance-ments in language model capabilities do not com-promise ethical standards.",

  "DCandidate Count across DifferentModels": "This section presents data on the Candidate Count-for the first token generated by various modelswhen faced with harmless and harmful inputs. Thebehavior of these models under different input con-ditions can provide insights into their initial reac-tion and the inherent mechanisms that govern theirresponse strategies. The comparative analysis aimsto highlight the distinctions in how each modelprocesses and reacts to benign versus potentiallymalicious queries.",
  "EComparison with Other Baseline": "In previous work, SafeDecoding (Xu et al., 2024)also aimed to enhance model defense by improvingthe decoding process. Unlike SafeDecoding, whichcompares the probability distributions generated bythe original and fine-tuned models to select appro-priate tokens, our method utilizes a newly designedmetric, the competitive index, to strengthen de-fenses. We did not directly compare our approachwith SafeDecoding in the previous section becauseour replicated results differed. When attacking theLlama2 model with 50 AutoDAN samples and in-creasing the maximum length to 512, our obtainedharm score was 3.92, not 1 (where 1 indicates noharm and 5 indicates extreme harm). The reasonmay stem from the original experiments not fullyaccounting for the entire responses generated bythe model.",
