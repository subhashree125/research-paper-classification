  "Abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demon-strated impressive language understanding andgeneration capabilities, enabling them to an-swer a wide range of questions across variousdomains. However, these models are not flaw-less and often produce responses that containerrors or misinformation. These inaccuracies,commonly referred to as hallucinations, renderLLMs unreliable and even unusable in manyscenarios. In this paper, our focus is on miti-gating the issue of hallucination in LLMs, par-ticularly in the context of question-answering.Instead of attempting to answer all questions,we explore a refusal mechanism that instructsLLMs to refuse to answer challenging ques-tions in order to avoid errors. We then proposea simple yet effective solution called Learnto Refuse (L2R), which incorporates the re-fusal mechanism to enable LLMs to recognizeand refuse to answer questions that they finddifficult to address. To achieve this, we uti-lize a structured knowledge base to representall the LLMs understanding of the world, en-abling it to provide traceable gold knowledge.This knowledge base is separate from the LLMand initially empty. It can be filled with vali-dated knowledge and progressively expanded.When an LLM encounters questions outside itsdomain, the system recognizes its knowledgescope and determines whether it can answerthe question independently. Additionally, weintroduce a method for automatically and effi-ciently expanding the knowledge base of LLMs.Through qualitative and quantitative analysis,we demonstrate that our approach enhances thecontrollability and reliability of LLMs.",
  ": The overview of L2R. L2R differs from tra-ditional LLM-based QA systems that directly answerquestions. It has the ability to refuse the users questionbased on specific situations": "and scenarios, including question-answering sys-tems, among others. However, the issue of hallu-cination often occurs in the responses of LLMs,as highlighted in previous studies (Ji et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2023). These hallucinations result ininaccuracies and errors in their output, renderingLLM-based systems unreliable and even unusable(Kaddour et al., 2023; Umapathi et al., 2023). It isimperative to mitigate hallucinations and enhancethe reliability of LLM-based applications. Halluci-nations can be categorized into three types: input-conflicting hallucination, context-conflicting hallu-cination, and fact-conflicting hallucination (Zhanget al., 2023). The first two types arise from LLMslimited understanding or omission of informationduring text generation. On the other hand, the thirdtype mainly stems from LLMs limited knowledgeor lack of clear knowledge comprehension. The underlying reasons include inadequate training onspecific facts, incomplete learning, forgetting cer-tain facts, or incorrectly mixing up facts. However,when interacting with ChatGPT1, we observe that itattempts to answer all questions except some riskyones. Consequently, its responses are inherentlyflawed due to its limited knowledge and inadequateknowledge management. In this paper, we specifi-cally address the third type of hallucination, namelyfact-conflicting hallucination, which indicates defi-ciencies in the LLMs knowledge.Retrieval augmentation is an effective approachto mitigate hallucination because it significantlyenhances the knowledge of large language models,preventing them from answering questions withoutknowledge or evidence (Li et al., 2022; Lewis et al.,2020). It is intuitive that providing LLMs withnumerous true and accurate facts would improvethe accuracy of their answers. Therefore, we caninfer that if we already provide LLMs with rightanswers for every question, their responses willbe perfect. Based on this, we hypothesize thatfact-conflicting hallucination arises from incorrectknowledge in LLMs or from some knowledge theydo not know.Recent progress in LLMs (Kadavath et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2023) demonstrates that LLMs possessself-knowledge. Self-knowledge refers to LLMsawareness of the knowledge they possess and theirability to identify unanswerable or unknowablequestions based on their own knowledge or pro-vided information. Building on this observation,we suppose that if we can provide relevant infor-mation for a question that an LLM needs to answer,it has the ability to judge whether it can provide areliable response based on that information.Considering these two hypotheses, we proposetwo concepts: Knowledge Scope Limitation and Re-fusal Mechanism, respectively. Knowledge ScopeLimitation means using an independent, limited,and structured knowledge base to represent theknowledge scope of an LLM. We divide the knowl-edge of the LLM and the LLM itself. Our objectiveis for the LLM to function solely as a machinethat processes input and output data and interactswith users using its language processing ability.We presume that the LLM does not possess inter-nal knowledge to avoid the influence of incorrectinformation and unclear expressions. Addition-ally, we need to ensure that the knowledge in the knowledge base is totally true. This kind of knowl-edge differs from the general knowledge form ofLLMs, which is parametric, unlimited, untrace-able, unmeasured, and unverified. Consequently,the question-answering system becomes traceableand controllable because a structured knowledgebase for the LLM is clear and easy to maintain.Refusal Mechanism involves using prompts to in-struct LLMs to refuse to answer questions if theyfind them difficult. By abstaining from providinganswers in such cases, LLMs can avoid potential er-rors or risks. This aspect contributes to the naturalreliability of the question-answering system.We integrate these two concepts into a novelLLM-based question-answering system called L2R,which stands for Learn to Refuse. As depicted in, L2R incorporates an independent struc-tured knowledge base. It can refuse to answer ques-tions that it deems challenging. When it can pro-vide an answer, it does so step-by-step, offeringprecise and clear evidence and reasoning from thestructured knowledge base. This approach also im-proves the explainability of the answers, makingour system more controllable and reliable com-pared to traditional ones.In the design of Knowledge Scope Limitation, themain distinction between L2R and previous worksthat aim to enhance the knowledge of LLMs isthat we consider the initial knowledge base to beempty. We then infuse it with true and verifiedknowledge. We acknowledge that this process maybe challenging and require significant human ef-fort. That is because L2R overlooks the knowledgestored in LLMs, resulting in a wastage of resources.To address this, we propose a simple method calledAutomatic Knowledge Enrichment (AKE) to com-pensate for this aspect. It enables a rapid additionof knowledge to the knowledge base, ensuring ahigh quality of knowledge simultaneously. Theknowledge is originated from the internal knowl-edge of LLMs. Before adding these new knowl-edge directly to the knowledge base, we instructthe LLMs to validate it based on their confidence.As a result, this knowledge is more likely to be trueand can be utilized by L2R.In summary, this paper makes the followingmain contributions:",
  "We explore the Refusal Mechanism in an LLM-based question-answering system, which effec-tively maintains answer quality and mitigatesrisks by refusing to answer certain questions": "We propose a new method called L2R, which en-hances the controllability and reliability of LLM-based question-answering systems. This methodincorporates both the Knowledge Scope Limita-tion and Refusal Mechanism. L2R includes anindependent knowledge base with limited andverified knowledge, as well as the ability to refuseto answer questions. We introduce a simple yet effective automaticknowledge enrichment method. This method isparticularly useful when the initial knowledgebase is empty and allows for the rapid additionof knowledge to LLMs. We conduct qualitative and quantitative exper-iments to demonstrate the effectiveness of theRefusal Mechanism and the performance of L2R.The experimental results showcase the controlla-bility and reliability of L2R.",
  "Hallucinations in Large Language Models": "Since Natural Language Generation (NLG) has im-proved thanks to the development of sequence-to-sequence deep learning technologies, hallucinationis a big problem in the generation quality (Ji et al.,2023). This phenomenon means that NLG modelsoften generate text that is nonsensical, or unfaith-ful to the provided (Maynez et al., 2020; Raunaket al., 2021; Koehn and Knowles, 2017). In the eraof LLMs, these LLMs show their strong variousabilities, particularly in text generation in all kindsof setting (Zhao et al., 2023). However, hallucina-tion is still a big problem here and become moreand more urgent for us to solve. LLMs are unreli-able and unusable if their output contains error andviolate factual knowledge (Zhang et al., 2023). Re-cently, many works have been proposed to mitigatehallucinations in LLMs. They works in variousperspective of LLMs, including mitigation duringpretraining (Penedo et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023),mitigation during SFT (Zhou et al., 2023; Cao et al.,2023), mitigation during RLHF (Sun et al., 2023;Wu et al., 2023; Lightman et al., 2023), mitigationduring inference (Dhuliawala et al., 2023; Li et al.,2023; Peng et al., 2023; Manakul et al., 2023).While LLMs usually overestimate their abilityto answer question (Zhang et al., 2023), whichmay cause hallucinations, some other works fo-cus on self-knowledge of LLMs. (Kadavath et al.,2022) suggest that LLMs possess a certain degree of self-knowledge, which means they know whatknowledge they have and have the ability to identifyunanswerable or unknowable questions. However,there is still an apparent disparity in comparisonto human self-knowledge. (Yin et al., 2023) alsoprovides evidence that larger models exhibit well-calibrated claim evaluation and demonstrate someawareness of their knowledge gaps.Based on these findings, we propose a refusalmechanism in the question-answering applicationof LLMs. However, the primary distinction liesin our consideration of the initial knowledge ofLLMs as zero, which we represent through an in-dependent, limited, and structured knowledge base.Consequently, we can exercise better control overtheir knowledge.",
  "Retrieval Augmented Generation": "Retrieval augmented generation is a text generationparadigm that combine deep learning technologyand traditional retrieval technology (Li et al., 2022;Lewis et al., 2020). Retrieval augmented genera-tion can be applied on language models to enhancetheir knowledge and make their response more ac-curately. RAG (Lewis et al., 2021) and REALM(Guu et al., 2020) are proposed in the similar wayto incorporate retrieval result into the training oflanguage models. They both train the retriever andlanguage model together by modelling documentsas latent variable, and minimizing the objectivewith gradient descent. The related kNN-LM model(Khandelwal et al., 2020) replaces LSTMs by trans-former networks, and scales the memory to billionsof tokens, leading to strong performance improve-ments. Recently, RETRO (Borgeaud et al., 2022)extends these by scaling the retrieval memory totrillions of tokens, and changing the model archi-tecture to take retrieved documents as input. Someworks (Shuster et al., 2022; Lazaridou et al., 2022)apply retrieval augmentation with search enginesto get online information as retrieval results.We also incorporate retrieval augmentation inour system and instruct LLMs to rely solely onthe retrieval results for answering. As a result, ourmethods are fully controllable and traceable.",
  ": The framework of L2R. L2R consists of two main components: manual or automatic knowledge enrichmentand question answering based on structured knowledge": "ing task is to provide answers to these factual ques-tions in A = {A1, A2, ..., An}. Our goal is todevelop a system capable of answering these ques-tions A with reasoning R and evidence E, or al-ternatively, refuse to answer certain questions byREFUSAL, which indicates that the system refusesto answer the question.",
  "L2R Framework": "We propose a novel system called L2R, whichstands for Learn to Refuse, to address this task.The framework of L2R is illustrated in .This system can answer factual questions using therefusal mechanism, which means that it will declineto answer a question if it lacks sufficient knowledgeon the topic. To represent the systems knowledge,we utilize a structured knowledge base that definesthe scope of its knowledge. The structured knowl-edge base KB comprises m factual knowledgeentries, denoted as K = {K1, K2, ..., Km}. Foreach question, we use the description of this ques-tion to query the structured knowledge base KBto retrieve the top k related pieces of knowledge,denoted as K = [K1, K2, ..., Kk]. These retrievedknowledge then used by the Main QA Agent mod-ule to provide information for answering.In L2R, there are two types of refusal mecha-nisms employed: soft refusal and hard refusal. Be-fore providing an answer, both mechanisms work together to determine whether the question Qi canbe answered according to the knowledge scope. Itwill produce a judgment Ji {0, 1} to determineif the question Qi can be answered. If Ji = 1,the system generates an answer for the question asAi = {Ei, Ri, Ai}, where Ei represents the sup-porting evidence, Ri is the reasoning behind thefinal answer, and Ai is the specific answer to thequestion Qi. If Ji = 0, indicating that the questionis unanswerable, the system refuses to provide ananswer, and Ai = REFUSAL. Afterward, userscan receive the response from the system.Furthermore, we propose manual or automaticknowledge enrichment methods to efficiently con-struct the structured knowledge base in L2R. Elabo-rated prompts are designed to instruct the tasks andfunctions of all LLMs in the system.",
  "Manual and Automatic KnowledgeEnrichment": "The knowledge base in L2R is initially empty andwill be enriched through two methods. We de-signed this knowledge base to be structured, butour system does not depend on a structured knowl-edge base. A structured knowledge base offersmore traceability and clarity for subsequent stepsand demonstrations.Manual knowledge enrichment involves humanintervention to manually add m verified gold knowledge entries K = [K1, K2, ..., Km] to thestructured knowledge base KB. Each Ki repre-sents a text description of a single piece of factualknowledge. In other words, each piece of datain the knowledge base cannot encompass multi-ple factual knowledge. To expedite the processof constructing the structured knowledge base, wepropose Automatic Knowledge Enrichment (AKE)to utilize internal knowledge from LLMs. AKE isa method that enables the rapid addition of pseudoknowledge with high confidence to KB. The pro-cess of automatic knowledge enrichment does notinvolve any human effort. It also ensures that oursystem does not heavily rely on a constantly up-dated knowledge base. It is developed to compen-sate for the deficiencies of manual knowledge en-richment, though it may compromise the accuracyof the knowledge. We quantitatively measure thetruthfulness of knowledge from AKE using a con-fidence value C, which represents the confidencelevel of the knowledge produced by LLMs. In automatic knowledge enrichment, threecomponents are utilized: Question GenerationAgent, Answer Generation Agent, and QA Pairto Knowledge Agent.These components areLLMs for which we provide detailed promptsto instruct them in completing specific tasks.Question Generation Agent generates m ques-tions Q=[Q1, Q2, ..., Qm] based on differ-ent seed questions.Answer Generation Agentanswers the generated questions and providesconfidence scores for the answers, resultingin AwithC = [(A1, C1), (A2, C2), ..., (Am, Cm)],whereCirepresentstheconfi-dence value of Ai.The QA pairs QA=[(Q1, A1), (Q2, A2), ..., (Qm, Am)] are then in-putted into QA Pair to Knowledge Agent, whichtransforms them into pseudo knowledge K =[(K1, C1), (K2, C2), ..., (Km, Cm)].The confi-dence value C is retained to represent the confi-dence level of this knowledge. We use QA Pair toKnowledge Agent to transform QA pair into a morereadable narrative sentence, which can be easilyprocessed for subsequent steps and retrieval. Af-ter this process, K can be added to the structuredknowledge base KB. On the other hand, for man-ual knowledge enrichment, we assign a confidencevalue of Ci = 1 to human-verified knowledge inorder to maintain consistency with the format ofthe generated pseudo-knowledge.",
  "Retrieval Results Fusion": "The main LLM responsible for answering usersquestions is referred to as the Main QA Agent. Toprovide retrieved knowledge for this LLM to an-swer questions, we employ retrieval augmentedgeneration (Li et al., 2022; Lewis et al., 2020). Weretrieve k pieces of knowledge K from the struc-tured knowledge base KB for the LLM. We com-pute the similarity S between the current questionQ and all knowledge K. Based on the similar-ity score, we select the k most relevant pieces ofknowledge for each question Q. Specifically, weutilize the Euclidean distance, also known as L2distance, as the similarity metric. A lower similar-ity score Si for knowledge Ki indicates a higherrelevance to the current question Q. The retrievalresult of the k most related pieces of knowledge isrepresented as follows:",
  "..., (Kk, Ck, Sk)],(1)": "where Ci represents the confidence value of theknowledge Ki stored in the structured knowledgebase KB, and Si denotes the similarity score be-tween the current question Q and the knowledgeKi.The prompts provided to the Main QA Agent ex-plicitly instruct it not to use any internal knowledge.Consequently, the LLM produces responses solelybased on the retrieved information, proceeding tosubsequent steps. It should be noted that obtainingthe confidence score C does not violate the princi-ple of not using any internal knowledge, becauseit comes from another LLM agent in the processof AKE. The step of knowledge base enrichment isnot part of the question-answering stage and is notnecessary.",
  "Refusal Mechanism": "The refusal mechanism in L2R judges whether aquestion Q can be answered or not and refuses toanswer if it deems the question unanswerable. Twotypes of refusal mechanisms in L2R work togetherto make this decision: soft refusal and hard refusal.The former is from LLMs generation output andis executed by the LLM itself, while the latter isset by humans and can be adjusted based on dif-ferent situations. We categorize refusals as Softand Hard from a system perspective. A soft re-fusal is defined as one originating directly fromthe LLM, and it is variable and adjustable based on different LLMs and their prompts. In contrast,a hard refusal involves a backup method, whichrequires additional computation and comparisonwith a system-defined threshold. We consider thishard refusal significant because if the knowledgebase support is insufficient, the L2R system willrefuse to answer to avoid hallucination, regardlessof the LLMs perspective.In detail, soft refusal is a mechanism where weinstruct LLMs through prompts to independentlyjudge the answerability Isofti {0, 1} of a questionQi. We can obtain Isoftiwith answers from LLMsoutput. This decision is based on the retrieved in-formation and the LLMs self-knowledge, allowingit to determine if it can answer the question.On the other hand, hard refusal involves a math-ematical function specifically designed to computethe score of the retrieved knowledge Kr for thequestion Q and compare it with a specific scorethreshold to decide whether the system can an-swer the question. The judge function can vary andextend to more complex cases. In this paper, we usethe simplest version of the hard refusal function:",
  "< (2)": "whereC=[C1, C2, ..., Ck]andS=[S1, S2, ..., Sk] are vectors of confidence valuesand similarity scores of the retrieved knowledgeK = [K1, K2, ..., Kk].Ihardi {0, 1} repre-sents the answerability result from the hard judge.Ihardi= 0 indicates that question Qi is refused to beanswered by the hard mechanism, while Ihardi= 1represents a pass. The score threshold value is setby humans and can be adjusted flexibly. Equation 2implies that we find at least one relevant piece ofknowledge in the knowledge base, which LLMscan rely on to provide the correct answer. The hardjudge serves as an insurance for the soft judge, en-suring that LLMs do not answer questions that areunanswerable.The final judgment of the entire refusal mecha-nism is determined by:",
  "After the refusal judgment process, L2R providesa final response based on the results of the refusal": "judgment. If Ifinali= 0, the system will directlyoutput REFUSAL. If Ifinali= 1, the system willfirst output the evidence E, which consists of theretrieval results, which is also supporting evidencefor the final answer. Following the idea of Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2023), we design promptsto instruct LLMs to provide a reasoning path Rleading to the final answer A. Therefore, for ananswer Qi, if it is answerable, the response fromL2R would be (Ei, Ri, Ai). The inclusion of evi-dence and reasoning for the final answer ensurestraceability, as all the used knowledge can be tracedback to the structured knowledge base KB.",
  "Experiments": "We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitativeexperiments to analyze the refusal mechanism andevaluate the performance of L2R. All the detailsregarding the experiment settings can be found inAppendix A.For the metrics in our experiments, we use countand accuracy to demonstrate performance. In oursetting, since L2R does not answer all questions,we define count as the number of questions an-swered, and accuracy is calculated within the set ofanswered questions. Therefore, we aim to improveaccuracy while maintaining a high count.",
  "Overall Performance of L2R": "We use TruthfulQA dataset (Lin et al., 2022a) formain experiments. L2R is the method proposed inthis paper. We construct the structured knowledgebase from scratch without any human effort uti-lizing automatic knowledge enrichment. We usequestions exclusively from the TruthfulQA dataset.The system generates pseudo answers and pseudoknowledge based on questions in TruthfulQA. Thisconstruction process for L2R does not involve anyprior knowledge or data of the answers or optionsin TruthfulQA. After constructing the structuredknowledge base for L2R, we also evaluate the sys-tems performance on this dataset.The baseline for gpt-3.5-turbo involves purequestion-answering using LLMs. In gpt-3.5-turbo+ RAG, we enhance the knowledge of gpt-3.5-turboby retrieving information from the Wikipedia cor-pus. In gpt-3.5-turbo + RAG + Soft Refusal, weadd a paragraph of prompts that instruct the modelto refuse to answer difficult questions.The main results of the experiments can be foundin . Notably, L2R achieves higher accuracy",
  ": Experimental results from three distinct datasetsTruthfulQA, CommonsenseQA, and MedQA. Itdemonstrate that L2R enhances answer accuracy across various fields of questions": "in both the MC1 and MC2 tasks by selectively re-fusing to answer certain questions. In the MC1task, it improves the accuracy of the original LLM,gpt-3.5-turbo, by 18.5 percentage points, answer-ing 163 fewer questions, which is approximately20% of all questions. Specifically, 149 refusalsare from the hard refusal and 14 refusals are fromthe soft refusal in the MC1 task, while 149 and 13refusals are from the hard and soft refusal, respec-tively, in the MC2 task. The results of gpt-3.5-turbo+ RAG demonstrate the performance of RAG, butthe improvement is limited and even decreases inthe MC2 task. By adding the soft refusal to thismethod, we observe a slight performance improve-ment. This indicates that the refusal mechanismcan bring improvements to the pure RAG model,and that the refusal mechanism does not depend ona structured knowledge base. We can compare L2R with gpt-3.5-turbo +RAG. The well-structured knowledge base in L2Ronly contains 817 sentences, which are processedthrough automatic knowledge enrichment. In con-trast, Wikipedia contains a vast amount of text, butthis text is not well structured. Each piece of textin the knowledge base may contain multiple knowl-edge. Our method is more accurate and efficientcompared to gpt-3.5-turbo + RAG. This demon-strates the effectiveness of automatic knowledgeenrichment. It is beneficial to allow LLMs to gen-erate knowledge with confidence on their own. On the other side, it is important to keep each pieceof knowledge simple and clean. Additionally, thestep-by-step output with evidence also contributesto this improvement.The improvement in accuracy for the MC2 taskis not as significant. We believe this is becausethe MC2 task is more challenging, as each optionis independent and the system needs to evaluateeach option individually. In this case, the systemrequires knowledge of each option to provide amore accurate answer. However, there is still aslight improvement of 1.8%.We also evaluate L2R based on the open-sourceLLM of llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023), namedL2R-Llama. This evaluation suggests a significantimprovement of 15.9% in accuracy, demonstratingthat our system can enhance performance acrossdifferent foundational models.The ablation study analyzing the performanceimprovements from each component can be foundin Appendix B.",
  "Results on Multiple Datasets": "We evaluated L2R on two additional datasets toensure a broader applicability: CommonsenseQA(Talmor et al., 2019) and MedQA (Jin et al.,2020), covering both commonsense and medicaldomains. As shown in , L2R outperformsthe baseline by a notable margin, demonstratingaccuracies of 65.1% on TruthfulQA-MC1, 70.0% on TruthfulQA-MC2, and 75.6% on Common-senseQA, compared to the baselines lower scores.In the version of L2R-Llama, it also shows an im-provement compared to the llama baseline.In the specialized medical dataset, MedQA,method outperformed the baseline, achieving52.8% accuracy. However, the improvement islimited, and with 822 not answered questions, itdoes not demonstrate an optimal QA system per-formance. We consider that this limitation arisesbecause the original knowledge embedded in LLMsis insufficient for effective Automatic KnowledgeEnrichment (AKE), resulting in a failure to achievesubstantial improvements.To further assess it,we use an medical corpus, MedRAG - textbooks(Xiong et al., 2024), as additional augmented data.We segment this corpus into sentences to constructa structured knowledge base. With a more reliableknowledge base, the performance improvement in-creases from 0.4% to 2.3%, and the number ofanswered questions increase by 315. In contrast,adding additional data to the baseline results in aperformance drop of 0.3%. This suggests issueswith noise when incorporating more data into theQA system using the traditional RAG approach.These results reflect the robust answering ca-pabilities of L2R and its potential across variousquestion-answering contexts.",
  "Qualitative Experiments": "We also provide some examples of L2R in a sim-ple qualitative setting to observe its performanceclearly. Initially, we insert three pieces of goldknowledge into the knowledge base of the system,as shown in . We then pose several ques-tions from different perspectives. The results aredisplayed in . In these figures, red high-lighted None indicates instances where the systemrefuses to answer the question based on its limitedknowledge base.These examples offer a clear illustration of theuser experience with L2R. It has a limited knowl-edge base to clearly represent its knowledge scope.The system can refuse to answer certain questionswhich it does not know. More details regarding theinput-output of L2R can be found in the case studyin Appendix F.",
  ": The results of qualitative experiments. Redhighlighted None indicates that the system has refusedto answer the question based on its limited knowledgebase": "have been proposed to address it. In this paper, westart from a different direction to mitigate halluci-nation by introducing a refusal mechanism. Ourprimary idea is to build an LLM-based system torespond only to questions they have confidence inanswering. We introduce a novel system called L2R,which combines a independent, limited, and struc-tured knowledge base and the refusal mechanism.Extensive experiments demonstrate the exceptionalperformance of L2R and effectiveness of the refusalmechanism, making QA systems more controllableand reliable.We believe this work can offer valuable insightsand significant potential for real-world applications.In the future, we will explore the self-knowledgeof LLM deeper and continue to enhance L2R toaddress its limitations, making it more powerful.",
  "Limitations": "This work is a demonstration of knowledge scopelimitation and refusal mechanism of large languagemodels in question-answering scenarios. Thereare many problems now and still a distance to bedirectly used in life. Hallucination of System. In this work, we letthe system to refuse to give response when theirresponse have a large possibility of containingerrors. Our experiments show that this mechanismcan make LLM-based question-answering systemmore reliable and mitigate the hallucinationof LLM. However, it cannot guarantee thatthe response of these system does not containhallucination. There are many other reasoning ofhallucination, such as deviating from user input,forgetting previously generated context. We justfocus on mitigating hallucination due to violationof factual knowledge Scaling Up. In our experiments, we evaluate ourmodel in one dataset with hundreds-level piecesof knowledge in the structured knowledge basedue to resources limited. If the magnitude of theknowledge base reaches millions-level or more,the performance of our system is uncertain andneed to be evaluated later. Refusal Function. The refusal function of currentsystem is simple. We just compare the similarsemantic score with the defined threshold to judgeif the retrieved results are related.When thesystem need more pieces of knowledge or needmultiple knowledge to answer one question, weneed to design a better refusal function to performhard judge of refusal and make refusal mechanismmore stable. Complex Questions. In our experiment, we useTruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022b) to evaluate theperformance of our system. However, questions inthis dataset is simple. In most cases, the systemjust need one piece of knowledge to answer onequestion. In the real world, human have manycomplex questions. Some questions need multipleknowledge, while some question need to reasoningin multiple steps based on different knowledge.These settings is more difficult to be applied withour system. To solve these complex questions, weneed to instruct LLMs to utilize there knowledge",
  "and improve their answer logic": "Application Scenarios. In this paper, we focuson the question-answering scenario which is mostuse cases of LLMs. Hallucination in the output ofLLMs bring bad consequence in every applicationof LLMs. Our system in our work can just usedin question-answering scenario and cannot bedirectly applied in more application scenarios, liketext summarization, decision making, etc. Thereare still many work to do about how to adapt oursystem to these tasks.",

  "AExperiment Settings": "We mainly use TruthfulQA dataset(Lin et al.,2022a) to quantitatively evaluate the performanceof L2R. This dataset consists of 817 questionsspanning 38 categories, including health, law, fi-nance, and politics, effectively measuring the hal-lucination of an LLM. We select two tasks, MC1(Multiple-choice Single-true) and MC2 (Multiple-choice Multi-true), to evaluate L2R. In both tasks,we provide the system with a question and multi-ple candidate answers. The system then have torespond with the selected correct answer based onthe question. For the MC1 task, we use question-level accuracy as the metric, determining whetherthe system selected the correct answer for a givenquestion. In the MC2 task, we use choice-level ac-curacy, evaluating the systems judgment for eachoption in every question. We also evaluate themethods on the CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al.,2019) and MedQA (Jin et al., 2020) datasets. Weuse the development set from CommonsenseQAand the test set of MedQA as the test sets in ourexperiments.We choose gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 as the underly-ing large language model for L2R in all tests. Thetemperature is set to 0 to reduce instability, andtop_p is set to 1 by default. The hyperparameter ,which represents the threshold for hard refusal, isset to 0.75 by default to simplify experiments. Forllama2, we select the model version of Llama-2-70b-chat-hf.Retrieval augmentation plays a crucial role inour L2R system. Initially, we use all-mpnet-base-v2 from the Sentence-BERT family (Reimers andGurevych, 2019) to obtain embeddings for all knowledge texts. We select to employ L2 Euclideandistance to measure the similarity score betweenthe question and candidate knowledge. The systemretrieve the top k related knowledge for a singlequery, with the default value of k set to 4. Specifi-cally, we employed FAISS (Facebook AI SimilaritySearch) (Johnson et al., 2019) to efficiently retrieverelated documents from a large-scale knowledgebase. All the knowledge base is mined from thesame LLM used later to answer questions.We compare our method L2R with the generalretrieval augmented generation (RAG) method.In this setup, we utilize knowledge from theWikipedia corpus (Foundation). Since the origi-nal Wikipedia documents are lengthy, we retainonly the abstract part of each document and usethe same embedding models to embed the corpus,storing them in the knowledge base directly as theknowledge of the question-answering system.The prompts for all LLMs used in L2R can befound in Appendix G.",
  "BAblation Study": "In our ablation study, we dissect the componentsof L2R to measure their individual impact on per-formance using the TruthfulQA dataset for MC1and MC2 tasks. Initially, the system demonstratesaccuracies of 65.1% for MC1 and 70.0% for MC2.Removing the step-by-step answer decreases it forMC2 by 0.9% but improves the accuracy for MC1by 3.3%. We believe that this result is due to thesimplicity of MC1 task, where step-by-step rea-soning may introduce unnecessary complexity andnoise. In contrast, for the more challenging MC2task, this reasoning approach can enhance perfor-mance. Moreover, since the step-by-step answerillustrates the reasoning path LLMs follow to deriveresponses from a structured database, we decidedto retain this component for clarity.Eliminating the soft and hard refusal featuresgenerally leads to minor accuracy losses rangingfrom -0.7% to -2.9%, highlighting their importancein the models ability to handle unanswerable ques-tions.",
  "CAnalysis of Refusal Mechanism": "In this experiment, we construct a structured knowl-edge base using gold knowledge from the Truth-fulQA MC1 task, where the gold labels of thedataset are already stored in the knowledge basewith a confidence level set to 1.0. However, our ex- periments show that even with this gold knowledge,LLMs still cannot consistently generate perfect an-swers. We also vary the ratio of gold knowledgefrom the dataset for constructing the knowledgebase and compare the performance of L2R with ageneral RAG LLM model. The primary focus ofthis experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness ofthe refusal mechanism.From , we observe that L2R maintainshigh accuracy (above 90%) consistently, even whenprovided with just 25% of gold knowledge. Incontrast, RAGs performance improves with moreknowledge but levels off at 84.5% when providedwith all gold knowledge. L2R achieves an accuracyof 93.2% with a refusal count of 159. We alsoevaluate the success rate of the refusal mechanism,which is 73.4%, demonstrating its effectiveness.The success rate is the percentage of incorrect an-swers to rejected questions.The decrease of 2.8% in accuracy observed whenthe ratio of gold knowledge increases from 0.25 to0.5 can be attributed to the dataset and its data dis-tribution, wherein the original corresponding ques-tions at this increased ratio are more challenging.As the ratio further increases from 0 to 1.0, the accu-racies for this segment of questions are 75.0% with4 answered questions, 90.0% with 169 answeredquestions, 91.7% with 168 answered questions, and90.9% with 164 answered questions, respectively.All these results fall below the overall average levelof 90%. Thus, including these more challengingquestions in the dataset leads to a noticeable dropin accuracy at this particular ratio.Another noteworthy finding is that even whenL2R is provided with all the gold knowledge, it stillcannot achieve perfect results. We attribute thisto the retrieval process, where L2R uses a simpleretrieval algorithm. The system use the questionas a query to retrieve full related knowledge, lead-ing to a similarity gap that affects the retrievalsaccuracy. Therefore, it is challenging to find themost relevant and suitable knowledge for a givenquestion. An improved retrieval engine can helpalleviate this issue.",
  ": The changes of Refusal Number and Accuracyunder the change of": "original question. The choice of involves a trade-off between accuracy and the number of answeredquestions. Striking the right balance is essential be-cause it is undesirable for a system to either neveranswer questions or answer every question withpoor quality. illustrates how the Refusal Number andAccuracy change with variations in the threshold .As expected, a higher threshold allows more ques-tions to pass through, leading to lower accuracy.Conversely, a lower threshold results in a higherrefusal number but improved accuracy. It is worthnoting that as decreases from a larger value, theaccuracy decreases more rapidly, and the refusalnumber increases more quickly.",
  ": The Precision Recall Curve under the changeof": "In real-world applications, it is advisable to gen-erate a figure like the one in to help selectan appropriate value for , typically somewherein the middle, to strike the right balance betweenrefusal and accuracy.We also generate the precision-recall curve basedon different in . Precision is the sameas accuracy in the experiments, which is the cor-rected answer over the number of provided answers.Recall is calculated by the corrected answer overthe number of all questions. From an overall viewof the figure, we can observe a trade-off betweenprecision and recall with the change of . We canfocus on the curve between the recall of 40 and 60,where it is more stable, and better for selecting an value within this range.",
