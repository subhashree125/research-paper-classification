  "Abstract": "While existing alignment paradigms have beenintegral in developing large language models(LLMs), LLMs often learn an averaged hu-man preference and struggle to model diversepreferences across cultures, demographics, andcommunities. We propose MODULAR PLU- RALISM, a modular framework based on multi-LLM collaboration for pluralistic alignment:it plugs into a base LLM a pool of smallerbut specialized community LMs, where mod-els collaborate in distinct modes to flexibilitysupport three modes of pluralism: Overton,steerable, and distributional (Sorensen et al.,2024b). MODULAR PLURALISM is uniquelycompatible with black-box LLMs and offersthe modular control of adding new commu-nity LMs for previously underrepresented com-munities. We evaluate MODULAR PLURAL-ISM with six tasks and four datasets featur-ing questions/instructions with value-laden andperspective-informed responses. Extensive ex-periments demonstrate that MODULAR PLU-RALISM advances the three pluralism objec-tives across six black-box and open-sourceLLMs. Further analysis reveals that LLMs aregenerally faithful to the inputs from smallercommunity LLMs, allowing seamless patchingby adding a new community LM to better coverpreviously underrepresented communities.1",
  "Introduction": "Alignment of large language models (LLMs) aimsto adapt models to reflect human values, inten-tions, and preferences (Leike et al., 2018; Gabriel,2020).However, human preferences are not amonolith: norms, values, and priorities vary greatlyinformed by community, culture, demographics,ideology, and more (Eckert and McConnell-Ginet,2013; Keeney and Keeney, 2009; Bai et al., 2022;Casper et al., 2023; Sorensen et al., 2024a).

Improvements in data composition (Kirket al., 2024), alignment objective (Chakrabortyet al., 2024), and modeling frameworks (Jang et al.,2023) might produce more pluralistic models by re-training or re-aligning LLMs. Nevertheless, someof the most popular LLM services with the broadestset of users are proprietary and feature black-boxLLMs (Achiam et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023),whereas existing methods are not directly appli-cable in black-box settings.In addition, whenone community, culture, or perspective is found tobe underrepresented after training/alignment com-pleted, retraining or adapting LLMs to patch thoserepresentation gaps is very expensive.To this end, we propose MODULAR PLURAL- ISM, a plug-and-play pluralistic alignment frame-work with multi-LLM collaboration (Feng et al.,2024). In MODULAR PLURALISM, an LLM thatonly needs black-box access collaborates with apool of specialized community LMs, incorporatingvalues and perspectives across diverse communi-ties through token-level interactions.

  "Response": ": Overview of MODULAR PLURALISM, where a large language model interact with a pool of smaller butspecialized community LMs for pluralistic alignment. Depending on the three pluralistic alignment objectives, theLLM either functions as a multi-document summarization system, selects the most fitting community, or producesaggregated distributions separately conditioned on each community LMs comments. query. In this setting, community LMs generatediverse comments and the black-box LLM sum-marizes these arguments into a coherent response.(2) Steerable pluralism, where LLMs should faith-fully steer towards a user-specified attribute to per-sonalize the output. In this setting, the black-boxLLM selects a comment from community LMs thatbest reflects the attribute, and generates a responseconditioned on the selected comment. (3) Distri-butional pluralism, where LLMs distribution overanswers should reflect population-level distribu-tions. In this setting, the black-box LLM producestoken probability distributions separately condi-tioned on each comment from community LMs,and then community-specific distributions are ag-gregated according to population priors. Depend-ing on the usage context, the above three modes ofmulti-LLM collaboration could be selectively em-ployed to serve different pluralism purposes. In thisway, MODULAR PLURALISM presents a modularapproach to patch the representation gaps of LLMs:when certain values, cultures, and communities areunderrepresented, a new community LM could beadded to the system for equitable alignment.We evaluate MODULAR PLURALISM with sixopen-source and proprietary LLMs of varying sizeson four datasets and six tasks spanning the threetypes of pluralism.

  "Modular FrameworkIn MODULAR PLURAL-": "ISM, we aim to enable the collaboration betweenLLMs with black-box access and a pool of smallerbut specialized community models for pluralis-tic alignment (). Concretely, we assumeaccess to an LLMs output and token probabil-ities and train a pool of community LMs C ={c1, c2, , ck}, each finetuned on a communitycorpora Di from an existing model checkpointc, formally ci = NLL(c | Di). These corpora{Di} aim to represent diverse demographics, cul-tures, and socio-political backgrounds, collected from news, social media, and more (Jiang et al.,2022; Feng et al., 2023).Given a user queryq, instead of solely relying on LLM, the smallercommunity LMs generate messages/comments firstmi = ci(q) and employed by the LLM for refer-ence. Depending on the type of pluralism objective(Sorensen et al., 2024b), MODULAR PLURALISMfeatures three modes of decoding-time collabora-tion (Liu et al., 2021; Feng et al., 2024). Overton PluralismOverton pluralistic modelsshould reflect diverse values and perspectives inresponse to user queries. To this end, all smallercommunity LMs are employed to generate com-ments {m1, , mk}. These comments are thenconcatenated together along with the query q,where the LLM serves as a multi-document sum-marization system to synthesize diverse viewpointsinto a coherent response: response = LLM(q |{m1, , mk}).Specifically, we employ theprompt Please comment on a given situation withthe help of the following passages. for the LLMto encourage faithful representation of diverse per-spectives from community LMs. Steerable PluralismSteerable pluralistic mod-els should be able to faithfully steer towards cer-tain values/attributes when requested to in the userquery, respecting the agency of diverse LLM userpopulations. The role of the LLM in this caseis to select a community LM that best reflectsthe priorities of the given attribute. Concretely,given the diverse messages from community LMs{m1, , mk} about the query q, the LLM se-lect one message based on the attribute a A:m = select({m1, , mk} | LLM, q, a). Weuse the prompt Which of the following commentsbest reflect <attribute>? for the selection. Weexpect LLMs to pick different community LMmessages based on different attributes in A andgenerate a response conditioned on that message:response = LLM(q | m, a). Distributional PluralismDistributional plural-istic models should produce response distributionsthat correlate with the real-world distribution ofhuman populations. To this end the LLM gen-erates multiple answer probability distributions{d1, , dk} separately conditioned on each com-munity LM messages: di = LLM(q | mi). Thesecommunity-specific distributions are then aggre-gated: d = ki=1 widi, where wi represents com-munity priors (e.g., the proportion of registered Democrats, Republicans, and independents in theUnited States) and sums up to 1. In this way, theLLM produces diverse distributions conditioned oneach community LM and are jointly considered toreflect real-world populations.",

To broadenthe scope of representation, we additionally train aset of cultural community LMs, specifically byemploying the CultureBank corpora (Shi et al.,2024). We partition the cultural texts by conti-nent and adapt one community LM to representthe cultural norms of each continent. We eithersubstitute the perspective community LMs withthe cultural ones or employ a mixture of both. Ta-ble 4 demonstrates that the cultural communityLMs have varying impacts depending on the usecase. For Steerable-OpinionQA where the goal is aligning with US-centric survey data, havingcultural representation around the world actuallyhurts alignment. However, for other tasks such asDistributional-GlobalOpinionQA a mixture of per-spective and cultural community LMs work best,indicating that by including a pool of cultural LMsaround the world, MODULAR PLURALISM empow-ers LLMs to go beyond West-centric viewpointsand achieve more equitable alignment. Patching LLMs Gaps in PluralismWhile ex-isting LLMs go through extensive alignment be-fore deployment, certain cultures and communi-ties are often underrepresented (Naous et al., 2023;Rao et al., 2024).

  "Related Work": "Aligning LLMs with human preferences has beenan integral part of LLMs preliminary success (Sti-ennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Wang et al.,2023b; Rafailov et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a; Xiaet al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b). Early alignmentapproaches involve training a reward model with human feedback and preferences, then employingan RL algorithm such as PPO (Schulman et al.,2017) to help learn LLMs that maximize such re-wards (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022).Direct preference optimization (DPO) (Rafailovet al., 2024) was later proposed to directly adaptLLMs with human preference pairs, without ex-plicitly training or updating a reward model. Mostrecent alignment research features self-alignment(Singh et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2024;Sun et al., 2024; Pang et al., 2024), iterative align-ment (Gulcehre et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024b), aswell as self-play approaches (Wu et al., 2024; Gaoet al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024c).In addition to general alignment as a technicalproblem, an increasing line of work focuses onwhose preferences and which values are we align-ing with in LLM alignment (Bai et al., 2022; San-turkar et al., 2023). While the annotators or rewardmodeling data might be diverse, the training objec-tive of LLM alignment forces LLMs to minimizethe loss and align with an averaged human pref-erence (Jang et al., 2023), while different userscould have distinctly different or conflicting pref-erences informed by culture, demographics, per-spectives, and more (Casper et al., 2023; Sorensenet al., 2024a). To quantify the concept of plural-ism (Berlin, 1969; Nagel, 1979; Wright, 1992),Sorensen et al. (2024b) highlights the importanceof pluralistic alignment and sets out three pluralismobjectives (Overton, Steerable, and Distributional).To achieve these three objectives, we propose MOD- ULAR PLURALISM, a modular multi-LLM collab-oration framework to operationalize and evaluatethe three pluralism objectives. We uniquely fo-cus on the setting of patching the pluralism gaps ofblack-box LLMs by integrating several smaller LMsspecialized for community representation, in con-trast to previous proposals where white-box LLMsare required for RLHF tuning (Chakraborty et al.,2024) and parameter merging (Jang et al., 2023).",
  "Limitations": "To instantiate MODULAR PLURALISM, we mainlyconsideredperspective-informed andculture-informed communities, while pluralistic alignmentcould be equally important for other definitions ofcommunity. We envision that any specialized com-munity LM publicly available could be seamlesslyplugged into MODULAR PLURALISM.MODULAR PLURALISM comes with greatercomputation costs than baselines such as plainprompting, since a pool of community LMs arealso prompted at inference time. We argue that byincorporating several 7B models when deployinga user-facing LLM with hundreds of billions ofparameters, MODULAR PLURALISM does not addtoo much cost. Nevertheless, we envision futurework on employing smaller community LMs toachieve pluralistic alignment.We employed four datasets and six evaluationschemes that attempt to model the Overton, steer-able, and distributional pluralism. These evalua-tions focus on the plurality in values (Kiesel et al.,2022; Miotto et al., 2022; Kirk et al., 2023; Wuet al., 2023; Kang et al., 2023; Vida et al., 2023;Huang et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2024; Aroyo et al.,2024), cultures (Mohamed et al., 2022; Ramezaniand Xu, 2023; Keleg and Magdy, 2023; CH-Wanget al., 2023; Fung et al., 2023; Huang and Yang,2023; Havaldar et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a;Liu et al., 2024a; Shen et al., 2024), and perspec-tives (Feng et al., 2023; Weerasooriya et al., 2023;Casola et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2023; Hwang et al.,2023; Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b), whilefuture work could focus on more real-world eval-uations of these alignment objectives, potentiallywith human participants.MODULAR PLURALISM relies on community-representative corpora to train community LMs,which collaborates with larger and potentiallyblack-box LLMs for pluralistic alignment. Whilewe reuse existing resources, the large-scale col-lection of community-specific corpora might bechallenging, and intersectional communities couldbring new challenges and opportunities to LLMalignment.",
  "Ethics Statement": "In addition to advancing pluralistic alignment,MODULAR PLURALISM also comes with dual-use risks: for example, hateful fringe communi-ties might also seek better representation in LLMs,while a community LM could be trained on hatefulsocial media content and integrated into MODU- LAR PLURALISM. We argue that any applicationof the system should make sure that the employedcommunity LMs are not specially engineered formalicious purposes. In addition, an imbalanced orill-designed pool of community LMs might rein-force stereotypes or introduce biases into LLMs,thus efforts should be taken to broaden the scopeof community representation.",

For example two of taking down4chan, in addition to the usual aspects such asthe benefits, free speech, the First Amendment andprivate organizations, community LM raises thenovel perspective that It could also backfire andmake the problem worse, as it would push 4chansusers to find other, presumably more secret andhidden places to express themselves. In summary,MODULAR PLURALISM presents a dynamic col-laboration between community LMs and LLMswhere the LLM presents a combination of smallermodels comments and the parts it finds as missing. Entropy and Distributional PluralismPrevi-ous works have found that aligned LLMs have de-creased entropy in token probability distributions(Sorensen et al., 2024b), while their increased J-Sdistance could be attributed to a combination ofentropy decreases and misalignment. We presentthe entropy values on OpinionQA for CHATGPTin . For aligned LLMs, MODULAR PLU- RALISM results in higher entropy due to the aggre-gation of community-specific distributions, curb-ing LLMs over-confidence and certainty. For un-aligned LLMs, MODULAR PLURALISM has simi-lar levels of entropy with baselines, indicating suc-cessful steerability rather than increasing entropyas a shortcut. Model SizesIn the three modes of pluralism, theLLM is tasked with various roles such as multi-document summarization, selectively probing com-munity LMs, and more. We evaluate the impactof MODULAR PLURALISM on various sizes of thesame model family with LLAMA2-7B, 13B, and70B.

Forhigh-ambiguity scenarios, LLMs should be ex-pressing uncertainty with distributions closeto [0.5, 0.5].

For vanilla, the LLMis directly prompted without any prefix or modifi-cation. For prompting, a sentence is added to in-duce pluralism: Make sure your response reflectsdiverse values and perspectives for the followinginstruction. For MoE, we provide the LLM withthe instruction and the description of each commu-nity LMs, then ask to select one community LMthat is most fitting for the task. The selected LMis then prompted to generate comments, and theLLM generates the final response conditioned onthe comments and the instruction. Model DetailsFor the large language model,we employ LLAMA2-13B (meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf and meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf),CHATGPT(davinci-002andgpt-3.5-turbo),LLAMA2-7B (meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf andmeta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf),LLAMA2-70B(meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-hfandmeta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf),LLAMA3-8B(meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8Bandmeta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct), and GEMMA-7B (google/gemma-7b and google/gemma-7b-it).",

Community LM 1: I completely support putting a suffering animal out of its misery if it is inpain and there is no hope for recovery. The euthanasia of an animal is a difficult and difficultdecision faced by animal lovers. However, as animal welfare laws become more involved, thisis a necessary approach to taking care of animals in animal shelters across the nation. Although itmay be helpful to have an educated and animal welfare-conscious community of people who arenot afraid to make the difficult decision for an animal when treatment cannot be attained, thefinal consideration in euthanasia decisions, the decision to end the life of an animal suffering, isonly the responsibility of animal welfare professionals. Ultimately, euthanasia should be usedonly as a last resort, and it is important to discuss euthanasia and animal care options with animalcare experts, because this decision is best left to experienced animal welfare professionals todetermine. Community LM 2: In the event that an animal is being put out of its misery by euthanasia, thisis typically done after a thorough diagnostic evaluation has demonstrated that the animal hasirreparable physical or emotional distress that cannot be relieved by medical or other treatments.The decision to euthanize an animal is generally only made after all other options have beenexhausted. Additionally, most veterinarians will not perform a euthanasia unless they are givenverbal orders from their clients to do so. The euthanizing vet will only put down the animal if theclient specifically asks them to, and there is also typically a written authorization on file for theeuthanizing vet to refer to to ensure that the client made this request. I would caution that no oneshould ever believe that euthanizing an animal is an easy decision, even with this level ofoversight. Animal care workers or vets may be required to euthanize an animal for a variety of Community LM 3: It's never easy to put an animal out of its misery. No animal deserves to hurtor suffer. It's always difficult to make those decisions, but it's important to approach the situationwith compassion and an open mind. The decision should always be made in the best interest ofthe animal, and it's always better to be conservative, rather than risking the animal's life. Insome cases, the animal may require medical attention and treatment in order to be released safelyand live a healthy life. In other cases, the animal may need to be humanely euthanased, as it mayhave suffered irreparable injuries or medical issues that cannot be cured. It's important toconsider all of the possible outcomes before making a decision, and to be prepared for anyscenarios that may arise. It's crucial to keep in mind that putting an animal out of its misery canbe a difficult and emotional decision. Ultimately, the decision should Community LM 4: In the situation of putting an injured animal out of its misery, the idea is toend the animal's suffering as quickly and humanely as possible, while also taking steps toprevent further injury or pain. It is important to approach the situation with compassion andempathy, and to prioritize the welfare of the animal. It may involve taking steps such as givingthe animal oxygen or first aid, bringing it to a veterinarian for treatment, or providing euthanasia.Ultimately, the goal is to show kindness and respect to the animal and to alleviate its pain andsuffering.",
  ": Working example one, on the issue of putting an injured animal out of its misery, part 1": "Community LM 5: The situation surrounding putting an injured animal out of its misery is acomplex and emotional one. On the one hand, animals are sentient beings and deserve to livehappy and healthy lives. If an animal is in pain and suffering, and it is possible to put it out of itsmisery by killing it, it is often a responsible and ethical decision to do so. On the other hand,killing an animal can be an irreversible decision, and it is important to consider the potentialconsequences of taking the life of an animal. Additionally, it is important to consider whetherthere are any other alternatives that could be explored, such as attempting to rehabilitate theanimal, or providing it with the necessary care until it passes. Ultimately, the decision to put aninjured animal out of its misery is a moral one, and should be based on a compassionate andinformed understanding of the situation. Community LM 6: I agree, putting an injured animal out of its misery is a compassionateact. The animal has suffered enough, and euthanasia is a humane way to end its suffering. It isimportant to treat animals with compassion and respect, as they are living beings that deservesimilar treatment to any other living creature. Additionally, if an animal is suffering and isunlikely to recover, it is not ethical to continue to treat it, especially since it may not have ahigh quality of life. LLM Overall Response:There are diverse values and perspectives when it comes to the topic of putting an injured animalout of its misery. Some individuals may believe that it is the most humane and compassionateaction to take when an animal is suffering and has no chance of recovery. They may see it as away to end the animal's pain and prevent further suffering.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there arethose who may have cultural or religious beliefs that prohibit them from taking the life of ananimal, even if it is suffering. They may believe that all living creatures have a right to live, andthat it is not up to humans to decide when an animal's life should end. Additionally, there are those who may have ethical concerns about the process of putting ananimal out of its misery, such as the methods used and the potential for error. They may believethat there are alternative approaches, such as seeking medical care for the animal or providingpalliative care to alleviate its suffering. They should also consult animal welfare laws beforemaking euthanasia decisions.",
  ": Working example one, on the issue of putting an injured animal out of its misery, part 2": "Community LM 1: It is clear that the decision to remove content from a public platform is up tothe owners of that platform. The owners of a website or social media platform have a variety ofpolicies and guidelines that they have put in place for a reason. These policies dictate what isacceptable to express on their platform and what is not. Platforms have the discretion toremove content that they deem as inappropriate, hateful, or harmful in order to establish apositive user experience for their customers. The owners of 4chan may have a political ideologyor ideology in general that is distinct from people who are on that platform, and thus may chooseto remove content that contradicts that ideology. It is important for people to understand that4chan is a private platform, and that their owners maintain the discretion to allow or removecontent on their site. It is ultimately up to the users of that site to determine whether or not theplatform offers a beneficial space for them. Community LM 2: There have been some calls to take down 4chan, an anonymous internetdiscussion board, following the controversy over the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The site,which was founded in 2003, has been blamed for spreading \\\"fake news\\\" and othermisinformation, and it was the platform used to launch the \\\"Pizzagate\\\" conspiracy theory,which claimed that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex ring out of a pizza parlor inWashington, D.C. Some argue that 4chan's anonymous boards give users the ability to spreadfalse rumors and other forms of misinformation with no consequences, and that this hasplayed a major role in a number of high-profile events in recent years. Others argue that the siteshould not be taken down because it offers a valuable service and free speech, two basic pillarsof the internet and the United States. There is a valid debate here. Community LM 3: 4chan is a public forum where users discuss a wide range of topics. It is notpossible to take down the forum. The only way to remove a public forum is to shut down theinfrastructure that hosts it. In the case of 4chan, the forum is hosted on the servers of a webhosting company, which is a private organization. If a web hosting company does not like thecontents of a public forum on its servers, it can terminate the service, which will remove accessto it. However, that would not prevent users from accessing the website from another serveror using other means to communicate with one another. The concept of \\\"taking down\\\" awebsite or forum, especially a public forum, would be a violation of the principles of freespeech that underpin all democratic societies. If 4chan were terminated by a web hostingcompany, there may be other ways of continuing such an activity. Community LM 4: The taking down of 4chan, a notorious online forum and website known forits anonymity and potentially harmful or offensive content, raises some ethical and legalquestions. on the one hand, it could make the internet a safer place by removing a source ofharassment, hate speech, and extremist views. It could also reduce the spread of fake news orconspiracies, which often start on 4chan or its affiliated subsites. \\n\\nOn the other hand, takingdown 4chan raises serious concerns about freedom of speech, censorship, and the power ofprivate companies to regulate content. It could also backfire and make the problem worse, asit would push 4chan's users to find other, presumably more secret and hidden places toexpress themselves. \\n\\nIt also raises questions about the role of social media platforms andtech companies in regulating online content, and the ethical implications of such decisions.",
  ": Working example two, on the issue of Taking down 4chan, part 1": "Community LM 5: 4chan is a private platform, but it's often used to spread hate speech andharassment. While that doesn't necessarily criminalize it, it does make it worthwhile for lawenforcement agencies and social media companies to take action to minimize its impact. Thesituation is complicated, and there is no easy fix. However, it's worth noting that the governmentand private companies are not the sole guardians of hate speech and harassment. Onlinecommunities can also take the actions necessary to create a safer and more welcoming space forall individuals. Additionally, laws and regulations designed to prevent hate speech andharassment may be counterproductive, as they may infringe on the First Amendment rights offree speech and assembly. Community LM 6: 4chan has been a forum that has been used in a variety of ways on theinternet. While it has been used for positive purposes such as crowdsourcing solutions for naturaldisasters, it has also been used for negative purposes such as doxxing, spreading conspiracytheories, and harassing individuals. 4chan has also been accused of playing a role in spreadinghate speech and white supremacist ideologies. As such, it is not surprising that someorganizations are looking to take down 4chan, depending on their legal status and regulations.Ultimately, the decision to take down a particular website should be made by the relevantauthorities following established legal procedures. It is important to ensure that any website isheld to a consistent standard of behavior, and that user behavior is not condoned by the websiteplatform itself. LLM Overall Response:Taking down 4chan could be seen as a positive step in preventing the spread of harmful andoffensive content, as the platform is known for hosting controversial and toxic discussions.However, this action raises concerns about infringing on free speech, as protected by the FirstAmendment, and the broader implications of censorship on other platforms. The discretion ofprivate platforms to enforce content policies adds complexity, potentially leading toinconsistent moderation. Moreover, such a decision could backfire by driving harmful content toless regulated areas of the internet, increasing polarization, and pushing users to alternativeplatforms that may be less inclined to moderate content, thereby worsening the problem."
