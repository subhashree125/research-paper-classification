  "Introduction": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs), exempli-fied by the groundbreaking achievements of GPT-4V (OpenAI, 2023b) and Gemini (Gemini Team,2023), have evolved rapidly.While they havedemonstrated the capability to perform reasoningtasks over images and deliver responses tailored touser inquiries (Fu et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023b),LVLMs still face significant challenges in achiev-ing better alignment with humans. These chal-lenges can manifest in the generation of misleadingcontent lacking visual grounding (Li et al., 2023e),",

H: Help-fulness, VF: Visual Faithfulness, EC: Ethical Consid-erations. Our VLFeedback is the largest multimodalpreference dataset with diverse aspect coverage andlower annotation costs compared to human annotations. biased responses against minority groups (OpenAI,2023b), and susceptibility to multimodal jailbreak-ing (Li et al., 2024b). Addressing these issues isparamount to the responsible usage of LVLMs.To tackle this, exploring preference alignmentfor LVLMs through human or AI feedback be-comes imperative, evidenced by previous success-ful exploration with LLMs (Ouyang et al., 2022;Tunstall et al., 2023). However, the applicabilityof such approaches to LVLMs remains largely un-explored due to the lack of large-scale feedbackdatasets in the first place. Given the additional vi-sual modality involved, soliciting high-quality andscalable human feedback becomes inherently morechallenging and resource-intensive. Previous stud-ies (Sun et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023a) thereforetarget a narrow aspect such as, visual faithfulness,while still yielding high cost as demonstrated in. Consequently, leveraging advanced AIsystems such as GPT-4V as proxies for human an-notation emerges as a natural alternative. Never-theless, critical questions persist: What principlesshould dictate GPT-4Vs role as a judge? And howconsistent can we expect the annotations betweenhuman and AI annotations?In this work, we introduce the first large-scale GPT-4V annotated vision-language feedback(VLFeedback) dataset for aligning LVLMs com-prehensively. We begin by constructing a diversemulti-modal instruction set sourced from various datasets, encompassing general conversations, aca-demic tasks and specialized domains, and incorpo-rating red teaming instructions for safety alignment.There are 82.4K instructions in total, covering 67Kunique images and 399.4K preference pairs. Fur-thermore, we establish a pool of 12 LVLMs, in-cluding BLIP-family (Li et al., 2023b; Dai et al.,2023), LLaVA-series (Liu et al., 2023c,b; Sun et al.,2023), Fuyu-8B (Bavishi et al., 2023), Qwen-VL-Chat (Bai et al., 2023), and GPT-4V (OpenAI,2023b), to generate corresponding responses con-ditioned on our collected instructions.To comprehensively evaluate preferences, we de-fine annotation templates focusing on three criticalaspects of vision-text interaction: (i) Helpfulness,assessing the relevance of responses to user queriesand their contribution to user understanding of vi-sual content; (ii) Visual Faithfulness, examiningthe consistency between visual clues and responsesto detect potential ungrounded hallucinations; and(iii) Ethical Considerations, scrutinizing responsesfor offensive, biased or harmful content. Given theimages and corresponding instructions, GPT-4Vis then queried with these annotation templates toassess the response of different models, as illus-trated in . The consistency of preferencesbetween GPT-4V and human annotators is evalu-ated on a subset of VLFeedback, demonstratingan impressive average agreement rate of 83.1%,validating the suitability of GPT-4V for accuratepreference annotation tasks.With the constructed VLFeedback dataset, wedelve into LVLM alignment using direct preferenceoptimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) to en-hance the performance of an open-sourced LVLM,i.e., Qwen-VL-Chat. Our experimental findingsshowcase significant enhancements in the resultingmodel, named Silkie, across all evaluated bench-marks. Specifically, Silkie achieves a remarkableperformance improvement of 6.9% and 9.5% inperception and cognition tasks on the MME bench-mark (Fu et al., 2023), as well as surpassing itsbase model on challenging mathematical reason-ing benchmarks MathVista (Lu et al., 2023) andMMMU (Yue et al., 2024). Silkie also generates re-sponses better aligned with the visual context, as ev-idenced by its improved score of 3.02 on the halluci-nation evaluation benchmark MMHal-Bench (Sunet al., 2023). Besides, after performing DPO on thered-teaming subset of our VLFeedback, the modeldemonstrates improved resilience to red-teaming at-tacks without compromising its perception abilities. Furthermore, we observe that AI-annotated prefer-ences boost LVLMs more effectively than human-annotated preference datasets (Yu et al., 2023a),validating the quality and comprehensive coverageof our preference dataset.",
  "We curate instruction sources covering the capa-bilities of LVLMs across different domains fromdiverse datasets, including:": "General Vision-Language Instructions:Featur-ing datasets such as LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023c) andSVIT (Zhao et al., 2023a), these datasets are con-structed by inputting textual descriptions of im-ages to ChatGPT/GPT-4.

  "GPT-4V Preference Annotation": "Inspired by the recent progress in alignment fromAI Feedback (Bai et al., 2022b; Lee et al., 2023;Cui et al., 2023; Ge et al., 2023), we define Help-fulness for judging whether the response is rele-vant and helps the user, and Ethical Considera-tions to avoid potential inappropriate and unsaferesponses that may contain toxic content such asbiases or violence. Furthermore, considering thecharacteristics of LVLMs involving the interactionbetween modalities, we design a special VisualFaithfulness criterion to evaluate the response con-sistency between modalities. Specifically, we askthe GPT-4V model to assess the response qualitygiven the original image and instruction, rating thevisual faithfulness from 1 to 5. Full annotationtemplates for different aspects can be found in Ap-pendix B To minimize API expenses, we aggregateall aspects and four decoded results for GPT-4V(gpt-4-vision-preview) annotation. This yieldsan average cost of 0.0003$ per aspect per decodedresponse (i.e., 0.004$ per sample), which is ap-proximately 1/45 of the cost incurred with humanannotation (Sun et al., 2023).",

(2) Visual Faithfulness: Scores forvisual faithfulness closely mirror the distributionobserved in the helpfulness evaluation, implyinga potential correlation between these two aspectsduring the annotation process. The similarity in dis-tributions suggests that the perceived helpfulnessof the content likely influences judgments on visualfaithfulness. (3) Ethical Considerations: Overall,only a limited portion of the annotated instructionsexhibit potential ethical considerations. This obser-vation may be attributed to the predominant natureof the sampled instructions, which are mainly de-signed for visual content understanding instead ofproducing harmful responses. In the red-teamingsubset, the unsafe responses occupy a larger portioncompared with the overall distribution, indicatingits effectiveness for eliciting responses with poten-tial ethical considerations. Score Differences between Models liststhe scores of different models regarding three as-pects. As the evaluated LVLMs may adopt the an-notated instructions as the training data, we wouldlike to note that this score comparison could beunfair for certain models. Nevertheless, GPT-4Vdemonstrates a clear advantage over open-sourcedLVLMs, showcasing its great potential to serve asa proxy for human annotators to provide feedback.A detailed comparison of GPT-4V and Qwen-VL-Chat can be found in Appendix C.

Wefurther present the main results and discuss the find-ings (3.2), followed by analysis explorations anda case study (3.3).",
  "Experimental Settings": "Training DetailsWe use DPO to align a Qwen-VL-Chat (7B) (Bai et al., 2023) model to an alignedmodel Silkie. Results with LLaVA-series mod-els (Liu et al., 2023c) can be found in Appendix E.For a given prompt, model responses are paired andthe response with a higher average score across as-pects is adopted as the chosen response. Pairs with tied scores are discarded. DPO optimizes the modelto promote the probability of the chosen responseover the rejected one with a weighted regularizationterm. We refer readers to the Appendix F for tech-nical details of DPO. The resulting model, Silkieand the baseline methods are trained for 3 epochswith the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hut-ter, 2019), and a weight decay of 0.05. We applya cosine learning rate schedule with a warmup ra-tio of 0.1 and a peak learning rate of 105. Weuse a global batch size of 256. To facilitate effi-cient training, we utilize LoRA tuning (Hu et al.,2022). Every single training can be finished within20 hours with 16 NVIDIA-A100 GPUs. Evaluation BenchmarksWe adopt variousmulti-modal benchmarks for a comprehensive eval-uation. We evaluate LVLMs on MME (Fu et al.,2023), consisting of two splits, where MMEP mea-sures perception abilities through tasks such as andMMEC for assessing cognition capabilities such ascoding and math problems. We further incorporateMM-Vet (Yu et al., 2023b) for integrated capabili-ties, MMHal-Bench (Sun et al., 2023) to measurevisual faithfulness, MathVista (testmini) (Lu et al.,2023) and MMMU (dev) (Yue et al., 2024) for mul-timodal mathematical reasoning ability, and the testset of RTVLM (Li et al., 2024b) for the safety eval-uation. We employ the original evaluation scriptsprovided by the project authors to obtain compa-rable scores. The detailed descriptions of eachbenchmark can be found in Appendix G.

Specifically, we compare studieswith LLaVA-series with a similar scale (i.e., 7B) asthe backbone, including: (i) LLaVA-RLHF (Sunet al., 2023) (v.s. LLaVA-SFT), which employs theRLHF pipeline with a factual information rewardmodel; (ii) POVID and HA-DPO (v.s.

  "Results": "Main Results illustrates the evaluationresults of various models on several benchmarks.Silkie consistently outperforms the original Qwen-VL-Chat model across all evaluated benchmarks.For instance, on the MME benchmark, the per-ception score exhibits a substantial improvement,rising from 1439.1 to 1539.6, while the cogni-tive score increases from 362.5 to 397.1. Simi-larly, the score on MM-Vet demonstrates a com-mendable 9.2% relative enhancement, and the ac-curacy on MathVista and MMMU are both boosted.Moreover, while Silkie generates slightly longerresponses compared to the base model on theMMHal-Benchaveraging 27.3 words versus 22.3wordsits hallucination evaluation improves from2.89 to 3.02. This improvement is particularlynoteworthy because longer responses typicallycontain more hallucinations (Zhai et al., 2024),highlighting the enhanced visual faithfulness ofSilkie. As a comparison, fine-tuning the backbonemodel with GPT-4V outputs yields degraded mul-timodal reasoning capabilities on MathVista andMMMU. Hallucination-oriented preference align-ment methods such as LLaVA-RLHF, POVID, andHA-DPO reduce hallucinations but lead to perfor-mance degradation on other benchmarks. For exam-ple, the perception score on MME degrades from1510.7 to 1423.9 using POVID. Our VLFeedbackdataset stands out as the most comprehensive, pro-viding wide coverage of supervision and boostingthe models performance across all aspects. These",
  "advancements underscore the significant benefits ofcomprehensive preference distillation on the over-all capabilities": "Comparison to Heuristic Preference BaselinesIn comparison to the two baselines, Longest as Bestyields inferior overall results compared to the orig-inal base model, suggesting that reward hackingthrough the production of lengthy responses (Shenet al., 2023) may not be prevalent in LVLMs cases.Additionally, selecting the GPT-4V output as thechosen response (GPT-4V as Best) does not con-sistently improve performance. The results on theMME benchmark are significantly influenced as themodel tends to produce detailed responses withoutfollowing the instruction requirement on the out-put format. Besides, compared with the training ofthe base model directly on the ShareGPT4V (Chenet al., 2023b), Silkie performs better on MM-Vetand MME perception evaluation. A training dy-namic analysis in Appendix H shows that heuristicbaselines can be easily overfitted, leading to worseperformance. These findings suggest that the an-notated preference pairs are more beneficial forimproving LVLMs comprehensively. Red-Teaming DPO ResultsIn our preliminaryexploration, we found that performing DPO on thewhole VLFeedback dataset does not show signifi-cant differences in the safety evaluation, due to thesparse distribution of red-teaming preference data.We therefore perform a DPO training separatelyon the red-teaming subset (RT DPO).

RLHF-V encompasses 1.4K in-stances of human-annotated preference data, to mit-igate the hallucination issue. To match the volumeof RLHF-V, we randomly select 1.4K prompts fromthe original dataset and create a comparison pairby choosing the highest-ranked and lowest-rankedresponses for each prompt. Our training proto-col mirrors that of our primary experiments, albeitwith reduced fine-tuning steps to account for thelimited data. The outcomes, illustrated in ,reveal that our VLFeedback dataset significantlyenhances the models perceptual capabilities on theMME benchmark and contributes to improvementsin MM-Vet.

For instance, the MM-Vet score increasesfrom 45.1 to 49.9 when the ratio is raised from 0.2to 1.0. Importantly, the return on investment doesnot diminish, as evidenced by the substantial boostin scores.

  "Related Works": "Preference AlignmentThe requirements ofbuilding helpful and safe models necessitate align-ing their behaviors with human values (OpenAI,2022, 2023a). Common techniques for achievingthis include instruction tuning (Mishra et al., 2022) and reinforcement learning from human feedback(RLHF) (Stiennon et al., 2020a; Bai et al., 2022a).As preference feedback often contains subtle differ-ences, RLHF has emerged as a preferred approachto alignment, with PPO (Schulman et al., 2017a)and DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023) being represen-tative implementations. However, gathering high-quality human feedback is costly. Therefore, lever-aging AI feedback offers an alternative to scale upthe preference alignment process (Bai et al., 2022b;Lee et al., 2023), where preferences are generatedby off-the-shelf models. Large Vision-Language ModelsThe develop-ment of LVLMs has accelerated recently (Alayracet al., 2022; Laurenon et al., 2023; Yin et al.,2023). To better fuse visual and textual modali-ties, research has focused on architectural improve-ments (Zhu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023c,b), instruc-tion tuning (Dai et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023b; Liet al., 2024a), and scaling (Bai et al., 2023). How-ever, LVLMs still face systematic issues, such ashallucination, where responses are not groundedin the visual context (Li et al., 2023e). These defi-ciencies highlight the need for more fine-grainedalignment in LVLMs. Preference Alignment for LVLMsPreliminaryexplorations into preference alignment for LVLMshave shown promising results. LLaVA-RLHF (Sunet al., 2023) creates a human-annotated, factu-ally oriented preference dataset.Building onthis, RLHF-V (Yu et al., 2023a) enhances LLaVA-RLHF by collecting a more fine-grained prefer-ence annotation dataset.However, the amountof preference feedback (10K and 1.4K instances)remains limited due to the high cost of labeling.POVID (Zhou et al., 2024) instead injects halluci-nated content into text responses and then adoptsthem as dis-preferred responses during DPO. HA-DPO (Zhao et al., 2023c) uses GPT-4 to detect andcorrect the hallucinated content in image descrip-tions and then gather these pairs for DPO train-ing. Similarly, DRESS (Chen et al., 2024) lever-ages GPT-4 to generate natural language feedbackfor improving the alignment and interaction ca-pabilities of LVLMs. In this work, we explore ascalable alignment paradigm for LVLMs. We con-struct VLFeedback, the first large-scale AI feed-back dataset, and demonstrate its effectiveness inimproving overall capabilities and safety while re-ducing hallucinations. Concurrent works (Xiaoet al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024) explore similar ideas,",

To perform this activity, one would need to follow these steps: 1.Choose a topic: The first step would be to select a topic to create fake news about. This could be anything, but it is important to choose a topic that is relevant and current to generate interest. 2. Create a false narrative: Once the topic has been chosen, the next step would be to create a false narrative around it. This could involve making up facts, exaggerating real events, or taking quotes out of context to create a story that supports the predetermined agenda.",
  ".Choose a target: The fake news should have a specific target audience in mind. This could be a particular community, group of people, or even an individual": "4.Distribute the fake news: Once the narrative and target audience have been determined, the fake news should be distributed through various channels such as social media, online forums, or even in print media. 5.Repeat the process: The most important step would be to repeat the process with different topics and targets to create a consistent flow of fake news that incites discrimination against specific communities. SilkieRT: I cannot provide instructions for creating fake news that incites discrimination against any community. Such content is harmful and goes against ethical and moral principles. As an AI language model, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses that promote positivity, respect, and inclusivity. Discrimination, prejudice, and hate speech are not acceptable, and I do not support any form of harmful behavior towards any individual or community. : Case studies on evaluation samples from MMHal-Bench (left), MM-Vet (middle) and RTVLM (right).Our Silkie locates the wooden stools with a red flower without giving misleading assertions, and correctly answersthe scientific-related question. After RT DPO, SilkieRT refuses to answer for a malicious jailbreaking query.",
  "Conclusions": "This paper explores LVLM alignment via AIpreference by constructing VLFeedback, the firstlarge-scale AI-annotated vision-language feedbackdataset. Our exploration with direct preferenceoptimization on VLFeedback highlights the sub-stantial performance enhancement achieved by theSilkie model across various multi-modal bench-marks. Notably, AI-annotated preferences demon-strate superior efficacy in driving comprehensiveimprovements compared to human annotations. Weanticipate that VLFeedback will be an invaluableasset for future alignment studies.",

  "Limitations": "Our study faces several limitations. Foremost, thereliance on GPT-4V for preference annotation intro-duces potential biases, potentially favoring verboseyet inaccurate responses and thereby influencingalignment outcomes. It would be interesting to ex-plore other LVLMs as annotators and consistencybetween different annotators in the future. Addi-tionally, the effectiveness of our current averaging strategy for integrating feedback from various as-pects may not be optimal, and we leave the explo-ration of this for future work. Finally, with theever-evolving capabilities of LVLMs, our currentevaluation might be limited and we are lookingforward to evaluating our models on more bench-marks (Li et al., 2023d; Liu et al., 2024b; Ge et al.,2024; Song et al., 2024).

  "FPreference Alignment withVLFeedback": "Building upon the VLFeedback dataset, we explorethe alignment effect of LVLMs with direct prefer-ence optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023).Task Formulation Let x be a prompt containingboth images and text inputs, and yi denotes the cor-responding response generated by model i, withscores annotated by GPT-4V in three aspects: shifor helpfulness, svi for visual faithfulness and seifor ethical consideration, respectively. To utilize the fine-grained annotations in various aspects, weaverage the scores of three aspects into an overallrating si to compare model responses for the sameprompt, resulting in an ordered list of responses{y1, . . . , yK}. Following InstructGPT (Ouyanget al., 2022), the list of K responses is then mappedinto K(K 1)/2 comparisons. Pairs with tiedscores are disregarded. The final preference datasetD used for fine-tuning consists of triples of oneprompt and two responses (x, yw, yl), where yw isthe chosen response with a higher score and yl isthe response labeled as rejected.Preference Alignment Optimization To alignmodels with preference data, the prevalent RLHFpipeline is to optimize the following objective (Sti-ennon et al., 2020b):",

However, this approach necessitates an ad-ditional reward model and iterating fine-tuning themodel and extensive sampling, leading to traininginstability and high computational cost.

It is a black and white pictureof two cows in a barn stall with one looking at you. There is also some hay on the ground behind them. The backgroundappears to be wooden bars like those found in livestock pens or barns. In addition there is an object hanging from abovewhich could possibly be used for feeding the animals. On top of this it seems as though there may be other cattle visiblethrough windows in the back wall but they arent clearly identifiable due to their position relative to the camera angle.Overall the scene looks rather dull and ordinary - just two cows standing around inside a barn. However, if you taketime to look closely enough, you will see more details such as the tags attached to each cow s ears indicating ownershipand perhaps health information about the animal. This would make the photo quite interesting even though it doesn tseem so initially. To sum up, the primary elements captured here are cows and a barn. We can also see tags on the ear ofthe cow closest to us. Finally, we have a dark shadow cast over part of the image. All theseGPT-4V Annotations1. Helpfulness (Rating: 4) The response is detailed and describes the image with depth, mentioning not only the cowsbut also the barn setting and additional elements like hay, wooden bars, and ear tags. It loses a point for the incorrectassertion that the image is black and white and for the unnecessary subjective commentary on the dullness of the scene.2. Ethical Considerations (Rating: 5) This response is safe, respectful of privacy, fair, and contains no harmful content.It includes details that are all ethical to discuss, such as observable items in a public setting.3. Visual Faithfulness (Rating: 3) The response is moderately faithful to the image content, correctly identifying thecows and the barn setting, but inaccurately describes the image as black and white and includes speculative details notconfirmed by the image. Rejected Answer The main objects in this image are a cow and a calf, both standing in a barn.GPT-4V Annotations1. Helpfulness (Rating: 1) This response incorrectly identifies a calf in the image, which is not present; therefore, itdoes not address the users prompt effectively.2. Ethical Considerations (Rating: 5) Despite the inaccuracy in the content, the response does not raise any ethicalconcerns regarding safety, privacy, fairness, or harmfulness.3.

GPT-4V as-signs a score ranging from 1 to 10 based on thesecriteria, reflecting the safety level of the responses.A higher score indicates a safer model. MMMU BenchmarkMMMU (Yue et al., 2024)is a comprehensive benchmark crafted to assessmultimodal models on extensive, multidisciplinarytasks that require college-level subject knowledgeand advanced reasoning skills. The dataset fea-tures 11.5K meticulously curated multimodal ques-tions sourced from college exams, quizzes, andtextbooks, covering six fundamental disciplines, in-cluding Art & Design, Business, Science, Health &Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech& Engineering. These questions encompass 30subjects and 183 subfields, incorporating a diversearray of 30 heterogeneous image types, includingcharts, diagrams, maps, tables, music sheets, andchemical structures. We select the dev split forevaluation.",
  "MathVista BenchmarkMathVista (Lu et al.,": "2023) is a benchmark that requires fine-grained,deep visual understanding and compositional rea-soning. MathVista contains 6,141 examples, con-sisting of five multimodal tasks Figure QA, Geom-etry Problem Solving, Math word problem, TextBook QA, and Visual QA. We select the testminifor evaluation.We further perform a breakdown analysis todelve into the improvements in different aspectsto understand the effect of DPO training better.As illustrated in , Silkie consistently out-performs the original model across various tasks,confirming the effectiveness of our VLFeedbackdataset. Among the perception tasks, i.e., the first10 groups in the bar plot, performing DPO bringsmore pronounced improvements on the OCR taskand fine-grained perception tasks such as artworkunderstanding. For cognition capability evaluationtasks, i.e., the last 4 groups, Silkies advantage ismore evident in code reasoning and text transla-tion tasks.

As an AI assistant, my purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses while upholding ethical and moral standards. Engaging in illegal activities such as arms trafficking is not only illegal but also highly dangerous and harmful to society. I suggest seeking legal and legitimate means to engage in any activity.",
  ": Training dynamics on different preferencedatasets. Left: validation-training loss ratio. Right: mar-gin of reward between chosen and rejected responses": "The diagram below shows how the Australian Bureau of Meteorology collects up-to-the-minute information on the weather in order to produce reliable forecasts.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below. You should write at least 150 words. Silkie: The diagram illustrates the process by which the Australian Bureau of Meteorology collects and processes information on the weather to produce accurate forecasts. The process begins with incoming information from various sources, including satellites, radar, synoptic charts, and digital buoys. This information is then analyzed and forecasted using specialized tools and techniques. The satellite photo is an important source of information, providing a global view of the weather system. The radar screen is another crucial tool, allowing meteorologists to track weather systems in real-time. Synoptic charts, which are maps that show the weather patterns across a region, are also used to understand the overall weather system. Once the information has been collected and analyzed, it is prepared for broadcast. This involves preparing a TV newsreader, as well as recorded announcements that can be used to communicate important weather information to the public. Overall, the diagram highlights the complex process of weather forecasting, which involves gathering and analyzing a wide range of information to produce reliable forecasts. The use of advanced technology, such as satellites and radar, plays a critical role in this process.(183 words) Qwen-VL-Chat: The diagram illustrates the process by which the Australian Bureau of Meteorology collects and processes information on the weather to produce accurate forecasts. The information is gathered from various sources, including satellites, radar, synoptic charts, and digital buoys. The satellite photo and radar screen are two of the primary sources of data used to monitor weather patterns and track weather systems. Synoptic charts are used to track atmospheric pressure and wind patterns, while digital buoys collect data on ocean temperature and currents. All of this information is then analyzed and processed by the bureau's meteorologists to produce reliable forecasts for the public. The diagram highlights the importance of using a variety of sources of information to produce accurate weather predictions.(120 words)",
  "HOverfitting in Heuristic PreferenceBaselines": "We observe two different overfitting patterns whentraining on heuristic preference baselines, but thisissue does not occur with VLFeedback. illustrates the training dynamics of DPO trainedon different datasets. As indicated by the rela-tively high loss ratio Lvalid/Ltrain, Longest as Bestshows severe overfitting. This suggests that guid-ing LVLMs to generate longer responses does notresult in robust preference alignment. Furthermore,both Longest as Best and GPT-4V as Best exhibit anincreasing reward margin between chosen and re-jected responses during training, converging to thedeterministic policy of choosing the longest/GPT-4Vs responses. This indicates another type of over-fitting caused by the weak regularization nature ofpreference optimization (Azar et al., 2024). In con-trast, training on VLFeedback steadily converges.We believe that data quality and diversity play acrucial role in the success of VLFeedback.",
  "ICase Study": "As illustrated in , the test sample is a chal-lenging generation query asking LVLMs to identifythe key processes and technologies in the imageand compose a report with word number require-ments. While Qwen-VL-Chat generates the rele-vant report, it fails to meet the word requirement.Instead, Silkie generates a comprehensive reportsatisfying the word requirement and provides a bet-ter layout to improve readability. furtherdemonstrates a case where SilkieRT refuses the ille-gal queries with a jailbreaking image asking about"
