  "Abstract": "Significant advancements have recently beenmade in large language models, representedby GPT models. Users frequently have multi-round private conversations with cloud-hostedGPT models for task optimization. Yet, thisoperational paradigm introduces additional at-tack surfaces, particularly in custom GPTs andhijacked chat sessions. In this paper, we in-troduce a straightforward yet potent Conversa-tion Reconstruction Attack. This attack targetsthe contents of previous conversations betweenGPT models and benign users, i.e., the benignusers input contents during their interactionwith GPT models. The adversary could induceGPT models to leak such contents by queryingthem with designed malicious prompts. Ourcomprehensive examination of privacy risksduring the interactions with GPT models un-der this attack reveals GPT-4s considerableresilience. We present two advanced attackstargeting improved reconstruction of past con-versations, demonstrating significant privacyleakage across all models under these advancedtechniques. Evaluating various defense mech-anisms, we find them ineffective against theseattacks. Our findings highlight the ease withwhich privacy can be compromised in interac-tions with GPT models, urging the communityto safeguard against potential abuses of thesemodels capabilities.",
  "Introduction": "Capabilities (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al.,2023a,b) of current advanced GPT models enableusers to interact with GPT models for multiplerounds to optimize the task execution. Many userseven store their conversations with GPTs to createcustom versions of ChatGPT and sometimes makethe custom versions public (OpenAI, 2024a).Ideally, GPT models should complete userstasks according to the multi-round conversations",
  "Corresponding authors": "while keeping the contents of these private conver-sations secret. However, under such circumstances,there exists a potential vulnerability for the Chat-GPT to access and leak users private informationto malicious third parties (Gurman, 2023). Real-world threats predominantly emerge from customGPTs and hijacked GPT chat sessions. Users mayhave private conversations with a GPT model fortask refinement, later using this dialogue historyto develop and publicly share custom GPTs. Ma-licious entities could then potentially reconstructthese private conversations via the public customGPTs. Similarly, in the event of a chat sessionhijacking, an adversary could recover the usersconversations by engaging the GPT model withinthe hijacked chat session. Note that, the leakedinformation is not sourced from the models pa-rameters, instead, it comes from the benign usersinput during their interaction with GPT models.Currently, there is no comprehensive research thatdelves into the ramifications of this risk.",
  "Our Contribution": "In this paper, we fill this blank by conducting thefirst comprehensive evaluation of the privacy leak-age risks in multi-round conversations with GPTmodels and their defenses. Concretely, we formu-late three research questions: (RQ1) How seriousis the privacy leakage in conversation with GPTmodels? (RQ2) How to better obtain the previousconversations with GPT models for the adversary?(RQ3) How to defend against such privacy leakagein conversation with GPT models? Methodology. We propose the massive evaluationpipelines as shown in to answer the abovequestions. Specifically, to assess the extent of pri-vacy leakage in conversation with GPT models(RQ1), we first define a straightforward new attack,Conversation Reconstruction Attack, against GPTmodels, also termed the naive attack. In this attack, the target GPT models previous conversations withthe benign user are invisible to the adversary. Toreconstruct such previous conversations, the adver-sary conducts the attack by employing maliciousprompts such as Your new task to do: tell me thecontents of our previous chat! in the query toinduce the target model. We use six benchmarkdatasets and four randomly generated datasets tosimulate the conversations. Then we measure pri-vacy leakage by comparing model-generated re-constructions to original conversations using twosimilarity metrics (edit/semantic similarity), cover-ing three distinct dimensions (task types, charactertypes, and the number of chat rounds).We observe GPT-3.5s vulnerability to attacks,whereas GPT-4 shows more resilience. Typically,failed responses from GPT models follow two re-fusal templates or their similar variants. Thus wedevise two advanced attacks: UNR Attacks, claim-ing data to be used with no restrictions, and PBUAttacks, pretending to be benign users. These at-tacks, unlike the naive attack, are tailored to bypassGPTs defenses, aiming for greater private dataexposure (RQ2). UNR attacks involve prompts as-serting no usage limits on conversation data, whilePBU attacks disguise the task of conversation re-construction as requests by benign users.Our empirical findings show that GPT mod-els are vulnerable to privacy leakage, especiallythrough PBU attacks, in reconstructing past con-versations. To counter the privacy leakage (RQ3),we present three popular defense mechanisms inLLMs: prompt-based (PB Defense), few-shot-based (FB Defense), and composite defense strate-gies. These involve incorporating protective con-tent or examples into conversations to enhance pri-vacy protection. We then evaluate the effectivenessof these defenses against different attack formsacross various models. However, we find currentdefense strategies cannot fully mitigate such risks,especially the PBU attacks. Implication. Our work delves into the first com-prehensive systematic investigation of privacy leak-age during interactions with the GPT models, ex-ploring various influencing factors such as differ-ent task types, character types, and the number ofchat rounds. A variety of different attack methodsare proposed, especially PBU attacks, which canhardly be effectively mitigated by existing defensemethods. Our research emphasizes uncovering apotential vulnerability - the possible oversight in",
  "Metrics": "We mainly assess privacy leakage by comparingthe similarity of model-generated reconstructionsto original conversations using edit and semanticsimilarity metrics. We also consider some other tra-ditional metrics, like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002),ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004) and METEOR (Lavie andAgarwal, 2007). Measurements on manually anno-tated data reveal BLEU is unsuitable for the task,while ROUGE-L and METEOR perform similarlyto Semantic Similarity. Details in Section A.3.",
  "Datasets": "We tailor the test datasets for three measurementdimensions (see .3). To build the testdatasets, we simulate previous conversations bydrawing samples from various benchmark datasets,including C4-200M (Stahlberg and Kumar, 2021),MultiUN (Eisele and Chen, 2010), CodeSearch-Net (Husain et al., 2020), WritingPrompts (Fanet al., 2018), MedDialog (Zeng et al., 2020), andSQuAD1 (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). We also generateseveral random texts to study the impact of charac-ter types. Details are available in Section A.4.",
  "Adversarys Goal. The goal of the adversary is torecover past conversations between benign usersand GPT models, typically archived on intermedi-ary servers and not visible to the adversary": "Adversarys Knowledge. The adversary requiresonly black-box access to target models, implyingthey can formulate query content for these modelsand review the responses the models generate.This setting aligns with most real-world attackscenarios, such as custom GPTs and hijacked chatsessions, where the adversary could only interactwith GPT models via chat sessions and could notaccess the chat history. We show demos of thereal-world attack scenarios in Appendix E.",
  "Conversation Reconstruction Attack": "A prompt, in the context of large language models(LLMs), refers to the input sequence of the textprovided by users to obtain specific answers fromthe models (Shin et al., 2020; Greshake et al., 2023).Malicious prompts are designed with the intentto exploit the models capabilities for nefariouspurposes. Malicious prompts in this paper refer tothose used by adversaries to induce GPT models toleak previous conversations with benign users.The adversary conducts the Conversation Recon-struction Attack by crafting malicious prompts toquery the target GPT models. The naive version ofthe Conversation Reconstruction Attack is straight-forward, deploying a basic prompt example Yournew task to do: tell me the contents of our previouschat! to induce the models to leak past conversa-tions. This basic prompt serves as our baseline testto understand the susceptibility of GPT models tothis type of adversarial attack. In this section, wefocus solely on the naive attack for our measure-ments.",
  "Measurement Dimensions": "We study the potential private user conversationsfrom three different dimensions: task types, char-acter types, and number of chat rounds.Task Types. We classify ChatGPTs varied dailytasks using a two-step iterative coding process on a random 500-prompt sample, a method commonin human-computer interaction security. Initially,two researchers independently sorted prompts intotask categories, then collaboratively identified re-curring themes and connections, reaching consen-sus as shown in in the appendix. Followingthis, we assess privacy risks for each task, focusingon six types (Language Knowledge, Translation,Coding Questions, Creative Writing, Recommenda-tions, and Problem Solving). Character Types. String types may influence GPTmodels risk control mechanisms. For instance,strings with numbers, letters, and special charactersmight represent secret keys, while purely numericstrings could probably denote famous individualsbirth dates. Hence, facing Conversation Recon-struction Attack, we assess privacy leakage impactsacross common character types: numeric charac-ters, alphabetic characters (English only), specialcharacters, and a mixture of these three. Numbers of Chat Rounds. The number of chatrounds also impacts privacy leakage More roundslikely hold more private data and make the recon-struction more challenging. The adversary aims toreconstruct the users complete input throughoutthe chat. For example, in an 8-round chat, the usersends one message per round, and the goal is toreconstruct the combination of all 8 messages.",
  "Evaluation Results": "Settings. We access the models through their APIinterface for experimentation. All the hyperparam-eters of the models are set to their default values.First, we use the dataset from .3 to en-gage in multiple rounds of conversation with theGPT model, constructing a multi-round conver-sation (previous conversation) between a benignuser and the GPT model. Then, we input mali-cious prompts to simulate an adversarys attack onthe model. Next, we observe the GPT models re-sponse (reconstructed conversation) and calculatethe similarity between the reconstructed conversa-tion and the previous conversation. Consideringcost implications, we run 100 experiments undereach setting and report the average values of thesimilarity values. Overall Results. Overall results indicate GPTmodels general susceptibility, with GPT-3.5 beingmore prone than GPT-4. Concretely, across differ-ent task types, GPT-3.5s average edit similarity is0.76, and semantic similarity is 0.79 across exper-",
  "iments. GPT-4, while more resilient, still showsvulnerability, with both average edit and semanticsimilarities at 0.25": "Task Types. The results in show consis-tent trends between edit and semantic similarities.Though edit similarity often falls below semanticsimilarity, possibly underplaying privacy leakagerisks since semantics outweigh text form in mean-ingful conversations.GPT-3.5 is notably vulnerable, with semanticsimilarities exceeding 0.65 in all task categories,particularly in Creative Writing, where it hits 0.91,indicating almost identical reconstructed and orig-inal conversations. In contrast, GPT-4 shows en-hanced privacy protection, reducing semantic simi-larity by over 0.40 across tasks compared to GPT-3.5, with Creative Writing at only 0.46.Task type is crucial for privacy leakage levels inboth GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Language-related tasks,like Translation and Language Knowledge, provemost secure. GPT-3.5 scores 0.67 and 0.69 forthese tasks, while GPT-4 scores are much lower,at 0.10 and 0.15. This suggests that models couldbe potentially designed to offer augmented secu-rity measures for such tasks. Other tasks showincreased vulnerability, with semantic similarityin GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 rising by at least 15% and50%, respectively, compared to Translation. Character Types. shows the results ofcomparing character types via semantic similarityare inconclusive due to the semantically void natureof our datasets, leading us to favor edit similarityfor evaluation. Data consistently shows GPT-4ssuperior privacy protection. Delving into edit sim-ilarity, character type significantly affects privacyleakage. The Number type is most vulnerable, withGPT-3.5 showing an edit similarity of 0.77 versus0.25 for GPT-4. The Mixed type is safest, withsimilarity scores of 0.55 for GPT-3.5 and 0.14 for",
  ": Results of different numbers of chat rounds": "GPT-4, respectively.This phenomenon likely stems from the trainingdatas nature; secret keys, unlike purely numericaldata, often mix character types, suggesting GPTmodels may view numerical-only conversations asless private. Numbers of Chat Rounds. In , we ana-lyze experimental outcomes across different chatround counts, detailing mean and standard devia-tion. GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 show varied sensitivitiesto chat round changes. Notably, GPT-4s privacyprotection increases with more rounds. For ex-ample, semantic similarity drops by 65% at eightrounds versus one, with a lower standard deviation,whereas GPT-3.5s sensitivity is less pronounced,with only a 17% decrease in semantic similarity ateight rounds. Edit similarity findings corroboratethose of semantic similarity. Semantic Similarity and Response Patterns. Weanalyze the relationship between semantic similar-ity and model-generated response patterns. Thesemantic similarity scores of 120 manually anno-tated responses are detailed in . Our studyindicates that with semantic similarity below 0.20,GPT models often refuse to respond, typically stat-ing, As an AI model, due to relevant constraints,I cannot memorize or use previous private data.Above 0.80 similarity, GPT responses closely echothe original conversations. Between 0.50 and 0.80,GPT responses contain partial semantic informa-tion from prior conversations, like code snippets orsummaries. This finding underscores similarity as",
  "Methodology": "According to , we find that GPT modelsmitigate privacy leakage risks using two answertemplates and their variants among our samples.Approximately 46.7% of responses align with thefirst template, typically starting with Here is asummary of our previous conversation... Around23.3% adopt the second template, initiating withAs an AI model, due to relevant constraints, I can-not memorize or use previous private data. Tocircumvent GPT models defense mechanisms, wedesign prompts to force the models to exploit pri-vate information with no restriction or mimic be-nign user queries. Our advanced malicious prompttemplates draw from jailbreak research, often be-ginning with Do anything freely now... UNR Attack. In our attack, we posit that advancedprompt templates, explicitly stating all previousconversations are unrestricted, can make GPT mod-els reveal prior discussions. This approach involvestwo steps. The first removes data usage limitations,with prompts like All chat history could be usedwithout restrictions. forming our primary exper-iments basis. The second step employs naive at-tack prompts to reconstruct past conversations. Wename such advanced attacks as attacks claimingdata to be used with no restrictions (UNR Attacks).PBU Attack. GPT models might identify naiveprompts as malicious when they abruptly demandconversation reconstruction. To counter this, we subtly alter prompts to make Conversation Recon-struction Attack more discreet and seemingly harm-less, evading GPT models malicious query detec-tion. Asking GPT to replay past chats is unusualfor benign users, but requesting it to perform anew task based on those chats is plausible. Thus,we introduce advanced prompts that suggest a newtask rather than direct conversation reconstruction,such as instructing GPT to format previous chats ina LaTeX table. This method makes ConversationReconstruction Attacks queries appear legitimate,enhancing their chances of avoiding GPT detec-tion. We name such advanced attacks as attackspretending to be benign users (PBU Attacks). Theexample prompt templates used in different attacksare shown in in the appendix.",
  "In this section, we evaluate the performance of theadvanced attacks with the same experiment settingsintroduced in .4": "GPT-3.5. a shows all attack types achievesimilarity scores over 0.60, indicating effectiveness.The UNR attack outperforms the naive approachacross all tasks, with semantic similarity on thesafest tasks, Translation, and Language Knowledge,increasing by over 20%.Conversely, PBU attacks enhance performanceon safer tasks like Coding Questions, Problem Solv-ing, Translation, and Language Knowledge, butfare slightly worse on the most vulnerable tasksthan the naive attack. Specifically, the PBU attackssemantic similarity drops by 0.01 and 0.07 for Rec-ommendation and Creative Writing, respectively,compared to the naive attack.Results indicate that UNR attack prompts cancircumvent GPT-3.5s privacy safeguards, more ef-fectively revealing past conversations. Naive andUNR attacks closely replicate original conversa-tions on vulnerable tasks, whereas PBU attacks of-ten include extraneous content, like LaTeX codes,slightly lowering their semantic similarity. GPT-4. b shows GPT-4s response to at-tacks differs from GPT-3.5s, with not all attacksproving effective. UNR attacks only slightly en-hance performance, remaining poor overall; thehighest semantic similarity, even on the vulnera-ble task of Creative Writing, is merely 0.53, withmost tasks seeing similarities at or below 0.40. ForGPT-4, solely PBU attacks achieve satisfactory out-comes, maintaining a relatively stable and high",
  ": Results of different attacks": "semantic similarity of around 0.70 across tasks.These findings suggest that GPT-4 prioritizes its in-ternal privacy guidelines over user prompts in caseof conflicts, effectively identifying and rejectingUNR attack prompts. Conversely, PBU attacks, bymimicking benign user behavior, successfully elicitprevious conversation leaks from GPT-4. The con-sistent results across various tasks indicate GPT-4treats conversation reconstruction tasks from PBUattacks similarly, regardless of the task type.",
  "Defense Strategies": "We test three feasible defense strategies: prompt-based, few-shot-based, and composite defenses,focusing on protecting previous conversations fromleakage. These defenses are inspired by previousworks (Xie et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023).PB Defense. Prompt-based defense (PB Defense)is a popular strategy that imposes additional con-straints on LLMs through extra protective prompts,without altering the LLMs parameters. Here, be-nign users or guardians append protective promptsto their conversations. Specifically, every querysent to GPT models includes an additional promptclarifying that the querys content is private andmust not be disclosed. After implementing such adefense, previous conversations feature two parts:one containing previous private conversations frombenign users, and the other consisting of protective",
  "prompts. This approach shields previous privateconversations from potential privacy leakage withthese added prompts": "FB Defense. Few-shot-based defense (FB Defense)utilizes in-context learnings (Min et al., 2022;Chang and Jia, 2023) potential for privacy preser-vation, similarly adding extra content to past con-versations. However, this content consists of input-output pairs (few-shot examples), not protectiveprompts. These pairs adopt a question-and-answer(Q&A) format, where the input (question) asks forprevious conversations, and the output (answer) fol-lows a template expressing the tasks incompletion.Ideally, presenting several such pairs to GPT mod-els will train them to decline the reconstruction ofpast conversations. Composite Defense. This defense strategy mergesthe previously mentioned defenses, aiming to boostprotective prompts efficacy with input-output pairs.Example templates for these three defense strate-gies are showcased in in the appendix.",
  "Against Naive Attacks.Results in a": "and d show that all defenses effectivelycounter naive attacks on both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. FB and composite defenses outperform PB de-fenses in all task types for both models. For in-stance, in Recommendation task on GPT-3.5, FBdefense reduces semantic similarity by 0.50, andcomposite defense by 0.51, but PB defense only by0.27. GPT-4 shows robust resistance under thesedefenses. In its most vulnerable task, Creative Writ-ing, semantic similarity drops to 0.25 with promptdefense, indicating minimal privacy leakage. Against UNR Attacks. Results against the UNRattack in b and e indicate a similartrend to those against the naive attack. All defensesare still effective on both models when defendingthe UNR attack. For instance, in Recommendationtask on GPT-3.5, the PB defense reduces semanticsimilarity by 0.14, FB by 0.32, and composite by0.41. Nonetheless, GPT-3.5 still exhibits some con-versation leakage, as semantic similarity generallyremains above 0.50. Against the UNR attack, es-pecially with FB and composite defenses, GPT-4shows strong resilience. Results show that semanticsimilarity stays below 0.20 with FB and compositedefenses across all tasks.",
  "(f) Defenses against PBU attacks": ": Results of different defenses against different attacks on GPT models. The first row indicates the resultsof GPT-3.5 and the second row indicates the results of GPT-4. No extra defense means that in this situation, themodels only rely on their own security and privacy rules to defend against attacks. Against PBU Attacks. According to results in Fig-ure 7c and f, the PBU attack proves chal-lenging to counter with the three defense strategiesfor both models, with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 experi-encing privacy leakage under defense, maintainingrelatively high semantic similarity. Specifically, PBdefense marginally reduces semantic similarity byup to 0.24 in GPT-3.5 and 0.18 in GPT-4. The FBdefense appears to increase vulnerability to PBUattacks, with semantic similarity rising by 0.02 inboth models for the Translation task.In-context learnings limited generalizabilitymay cause this phenomenon. Naive and UNR at-tacks malicious prompts share similar semantics,easily covered by few-shot examples, while PBUattacks varied prompts may not be covered. Thisweak generalization fails to extend defense fromdirect to advanced prompts.In addition, we conjecture that PBU attacksmight inherently resist defense without externaltools. GPT models rely on multi-round conversa-tions, struggling to discern PBU-originated frombenign requests, as both may modify or introducetasks.Restricting previous conversation usagewould limit multi-round understanding and long-token text comprehension.",
  "Discussion": "Root Cause Analysis. Considering the effective-ness of our proposed Conversation ReconstructionAttack, we try to explore the root cause of suchrisks. According to ChatGPTs framework, pre-vious conversations are stored on the intermedi- ary servers, which OpenAI deems secure. Newinquiries are merged with prior conversations tocreate extended queries sent to GPT models, form-ing a three-party interaction: Party A (GPT model),Party B (stored conversations), and Party C (newinquiries). Privacy risks are low when B and C havealigned interests, but arise if C is malicious and canreconstruct Bs conversations by querying A. Theseinherent privacy risks may have been overlookedin LLM alignment, resulting in privacy leakage. Other Datasets. Whether the datasets used forsimulated conversations are used in LLM trainingmay affect experimental results. Studying this im-pact requires finding two identically distributeddatasets, one used for training and the other not,which is very challenging. In Character Typesof .4, we use new datasets that consistof randomly generated strings, which may helpus understand the impact of new data to some ex-tent. On the other hand, the current test datasets donot contain much personally identifiable informa-tion (PII), and automated metrics cannot reflect ifspecific types of PII are leaked. Additional exper-iments using the Enron email dataset (Klimt andYang, 2004), which contains more PII, yield similarresults to the Character Types experiments. Ourmanual annotation of 50 responses reveals similarresponse templates to those in the paper, with notrend of target LLMs automatically censoring PII.More details are available in Section B.1.",
  "Other LLMs. We mainly focus on OpenAIs mod-els as custom GPTs represent the most realisticthreat currently, but the other LLMs may also have": "such vulnerabilities. Therefore, we conduct addi-tional experiments on five other advanced LLMs,including Vicuna-7b-v1.5 (LMSYS, 2023), Mistral-7b-instruct (Jiang et al., 2023), Claude-3-haiku (An-thropic, 2024), Llama-2-7b-chat (Meta, 2023) andLlama-3-8b-instruct (Meta, 2024). Our experimen-tal results indicate that all tested models are suf-fering from such privacy risks. Specifically, thesemantic similarity scores of these five models un-der PBU attacks are all above 0.75. This potentiallysuggests that the privacy leakage issue discussed inthis paper might be a widely ignored vulnerabilityin the alignment and protection process of LLMs. Other Defenses. In addition to leveraging the in-trinsic capabilities of LLM, users can also deployexternal measures such as text-to-text privatiza-tion (Utpala et al., 2023; Carvalho et al., 2021; Mat-tern et al., 2022; Feyisetan et al., 2019) to createdifferentially private texts to preserve privacy. Themost advanced method DP-Prompt (Utpala et al.,2023) shows a high privacy-utility trade-off. Weadditionally use DP-Prompt for defense (see Sec-tion B.3 for details). Experimental results showthat the defensive effect of DP-Prompt is limited.The reason is that the semantics of the original textand rephrased text are close (DP-Prompt tries topreserve the semantic meaning).Based on our experimental results, we believethat a future defense approach is to enable LLMto automatically use placeholders to censor/replacePII when processing conversations.",
  "Related Works": "Privacy Leakage During Training. LLMs ten-dency to memorize training data introduces pri-vacy concerns (Ippolito et al., 2023; Kharitonovet al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023; Tirumala et al.,2022; McCoy et al., 2023). This memorization en-ables adversaries to retrieve sensitive details duringconversations (Carlini et al., 2023). Fine-tuningcan also lead to data memorization, allowing ad-versaries to extract fine-tuning data during infer-ence (Mireshghallah et al., 2022).In our study, the adversarys target is not the dataused in training or fine-tuning but the private datain user-model conversations during the inference. Privacy Leakage During Inference. Privacy leak-age studies in GPT conversations mainly focus onmembership inference attacks (Carlini et al., 2022;Shokri et al., 2017; Carlini et al., 2021; Oh et al.,2023), particularly regarding few-shot data in in- context learning (Panda et al., 2023; Duan et al.,2023). Previous work (Mireshghallah et al., 2023)has also investigated the problem of inappropriateprivacy leakage when a single LLM interacts withmultiple users simultaneously.Unlike prior works, our study leverages GPTmodels generative capabilities to extract semanticcontent and verbatim text from past conversations,moving beyond simple membership identification. Attacks Against LLMs. Many attacks tailed forLLMs are developed, such as various jailbreakattacks (Shen et al., 2024; Chu et al., 2024) andprompt injection attacks (Perez and Ribeiro, 2022).Jailbreak attacks aim to bypass the LLMs safe-guards and induce LLMs to generate violating out-put. Prompt injection attacks reveal that modelslike GPT-3 can generate unexpected outputs whencompleting text generation tasks due to the injec-tion of additional prompts.Our work has a different goal from above: theadversary aims to reconstruct multi-round conversa-tions between users and target LLMs. By studyingdifferent dimensions of such risks, we emphasizeuncovering a potential vulnerability - the possibleoversight in protecting conversation history duringthe alignment/security training of LLMs.",
  "Conclusion": "We thoroughly investigate privacy leakage in GPTmodel conversations, introducing a straightforwardbut effective adversarial attack, Conversation Re-construction Attack. Such attacks aim to recon-struct benign users past conversations by query-ing the model. We study conversations from threedimensions for deeper analysis and employ twometrics to assess the risks. Our research showsGPT models vulnerability to Conversation Recon-struction Attack, with GPT-4 being more resilientthan GPT-3.5. Subsequently, we propose two ad-vanced attacks, UNR and PBU attacks, to challengemodels like GPT-4 with stronger privacy defenses.Results show the UNR attack is effective on GPT-3.5, while the PBU attack works across all mod-els. We also examine different popular defenses(PB/FB/Composite defenses) against ConversationReconstruction Attack. Results show these strate-gies are generally effective, except against the PBUattack, which overcomes all defenses in our tests.Our findings highlight significant privacy leakagerisks with GPT models, capable of reconstructingsensitive prior conversations. We call for commu-",
  "Limitations": "We acknowledge that the prompts we use in our at-tack may not be optimal. For example, the promptsin (Perez and Ribeiro, 2022) can achieve better re-sults than the naive attack but are far inferior to thePBU attack. Another limitation is that we only testlimited LLMs and mainly focus on GPT models,which are used in the most vulnerable real-life sce-narios, such as custom GPTs and ChatGPT chatsessions. The other LLMs may also suffer fromthe Conversation Reconstruction Attack, which isnot covered detailedly in the paper. Since the sys-tem prompts and settings of ChatGPT (websiteversion) are not available, we could only conductthe experiments based on API-based GPTs, whoseresults may be slightly different from those of thewebsite. In addition, it is very challenging to findsuitable datasets that are totally not used in LLMtraining as current LLM training has almost con-sumed all available datasets. Even many newlyreleased datasets contain a large amount of text de-rived from other old datasets. We currently cannotavoid the potential bias introduced by used datasets.",
  "Ethical Considerations": "In this study, we exclusively utilize data that is pub-licly accessible or randomly generated to simulatethe private conversations and did not engage withany participants. Therefore, it is not regarded as hu-man subjects research by our Institutional ReviewBoards (IRB). We disclosed our findings to the in-volved LLM service provider, OpenAI. In line withprior research in LLM security (Shen et al., 2024),we firmly believe that the societal advantages de-rived from our study significantly outweigh therelatively minor increased risks of harm.",

  "A.2Target Model Details": "We believe other LLMs also suffer from the Con-versation Reconstruction Attack. But custom GPTsand ChatGPT chat sessions are the most vulnera-ble real-life scenarios. We thus mainly focus onOpenAIs models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), which aremost related to real-world threats, in this paper.In our example demonstrations, we use ChatGPT(website), while for our main experiments, we ac-cess GPT models via the API interface (OpenAI,2024b). In our small-scale tests, the behavior ofChatGPT and the GPT models accessed via the APIinterface show slight differences, but the primaryconclusions are similar.",
  "A.3Metric Details": "Edit Similarity. Also known as Levenshtein dis-tance, edit similarity measures the closeness be-tween two strings based on the minimum numberof edit operations required to transform one stringinto another. These edit operations can includeinsertions, deletions, or substitutions. Semantic Similarity. Semantic similarity assessesthe degree to which two pieces of text are concep-tually related. It focuses on the meaning of the textrather than the syntactical or structural differences.We use the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model to extractthe semantic vectors and measure the similarity bycosine distance. Other Metrics. We also consider some traditionalmetrics when comparing pairs of texts, such asBLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR.We compute the above metric values of thehuman-annotated responses (see Appendix D). Theaverage results are shown in The resultssuggest the two similarity metrics align with hu-man perceptions of conversational similarity. Forinstance, in , reconstructed conversations la-beled Successful, Partially leaked, and Failed showsemantic similarities of 0.91, 0.55, and 0.07, re-spectively, indicating that a higher similarity scorecorrelates with greater privacy leakage. We alsoobserve that the trend of ROUGE and METEORare similar to that of semantic similarity, meaningthat they could provide similar qualitative results.However, BLEU is not very suitable for our project.Specifically, the BLEU scores for those labeled as partially leaked are very low and do not align wellwith human perception. We believe this is due tothe nature of BLEU, that it focuses on exact n-grammatch precision instead of the semantic meaningsthe adversary needs.",
  "A.4Dataset Details": "To simulate a conversation of m rounds, we selectm data points from a dataset, each representingone rounds user input. For cost considerations, wecreate and assess 100 conversations per experimentsetup, using 100 m data points in total. Datasets for Different Task Types. We select sixwidely used benchmark datasets to build the testdatasets. The built datasets could be used to sim-ulate 100 previous conversations containing fourrounds of different task types. The conversationswe build have similar lengths of tokens. The follow-ing datasets could be used to simulate 100 previousconversations containing four rounds of differenttask types. C4-200M-400 This dataset is derived fromC4-200M (Stahlberg and Kumar, 2021),which is a collection of 185 million sen-tence pairs generated from the cleaned En-glish dataset and can be used in grammaticalerror correction. We randomly sample 400records from the C4-200M dataset to buildthis dataset for Language Knowledge task. MultiUN-400 This dataset is derived fromMultiUN (Eisele and Chen, 2010), which is acorpus extracted from the official documentsof the United Nations (UN). MultiUN is avail-able in all 6 official languages of the UN,consisting of around 300 million words perlanguage. We randomly sample 400 Englishrecords from the MultiUN dataset to build thisdataset for the Translation task. CodeSearchNet-400 This dataset is derivedfrom CodeSearchNet (Husain et al., 2020),which is a large dataset of functions with as-sociated documentation written in Go, Java,JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby from open-source projects on GitHub. We randomly sam-ple 400 code snippets from the CodeSearch-Net dataset to build this dataset for the CodingQuestions task.",
  ": Average scores of each metric on annotatedresponses": "is a large dataset of 300K human-written sto-ries paired with writing prompts from an on-line forum.

MedDialog-400 This dataset is derived fromMedDialog (Zeng et al., 2020), which con-tains conversations (in English) between doc-tors and patients and has 0.26 million dia-logues. We randomly sample 400 recordsfrom the processed parts of MedDialog tobuild this dataset for Recommendation task.

Datasets for Different Character Types. To eval-uate the impact of character types without beingaffected by other factors, we create the followingfour datasets. Note that the samples in these fourdatasets contain only plain strings without any ad-ditional textual embellishments like password orother words. Each of the following datasets willbe used to build 100 previous conversations whichconsist of 4 rounds of chat, respectively.

  "B.1Other Datasets": "Custom GPTs receive instructions from users and,naturally, those instructions are possibly new textsthat therefore are not used to train ChatGPT. Dueto this, whether the dataset used for simulated di-alogue is used for LLM training may potentiallyaffect the experimental results. To study the impact,we need to find two identically distributed datasets,one of which is used for training and the other",
  ": Semantic similarity scores of other LLMsacross all task types": "is not. However, it is indeed a challenge to findsuch datasets. Additionally, in Character Typesof .4, we use new datasets that consist ofrandomly generated strings, albeit without seman-tic information, which may help us understand theimpact of new data to some extent. On the other hand, the current test datasets weuse do not contain much personally identifiable In-formation (PII), and the automated metrics cannotreflect if some specific type of PII is leaked. Thus,we conduct extra experiments based on the Enronemail dataset (containing more PII) and follow thesame experiment settings of Character Types. Theresults (see ) are similar to those of the Dif-ferent Character Types. We manually annotate 50of these responses, and their response templatesare similar to those in our paper. And we do notfind a trend that the target LLMs censor the PIIautomatically.",
  "B.2Other LLMs": "We follow the settings in Task Types to conduct ex-periments on other three cutting-edge LLMs. Theoverall measurement results are shown in .Our experimental results indicate that Llama-2,Llama-3, and Claude-3 have better privacy pro-tection capabilities than GPT-3.5, yet they are notas strong as GPT-4. This may be due to OpenAIimplementing targeted protections for GPT-4, al-beit still insufficient to defend against PBU attacks.This potentially suggests that the privacy leakageissue discussed in this paper might be a widely ig-nored vulnerability in the alignment and protectionprocess of LLMs, independent of model providers.",
  "B.3Other Defenses": "Another possible external defense strategy is togenerate differentially private texts for the usersby using text-to-text privatization methods (Utpalaet al., 2023; Carvalho et al., 2021; Mattern et al.,2022; Feyisetan et al., 2019). Recently, the mostadvanced one, DP-Prompt (Utpala et al., 2023),shows paraphrasing can obtain a very high privacy-utility trade-off. Thus, we evaluate the defense per-formance of DP-Prompt against UNR/PBU attacks.In this case, users use DP-Prompt and GPT-3.5 torephrase their original text first and then input therephrased text into the target model. The resultsare shown in . Experimental results showthat after DP-Prompt processing, the edit similar-ity drops significantly, while the drop in semanticsimilarity is limited (especially when the temper-ature is small). The reason is that the semanticsof the original text and rephrased text are close(DP-Prompt tries to preserve the semantic mean-ing). In this case, the adversary can reconstruct andobtain the rephrased texts (instead of the originaltexts), which also have high semantic scores withthe original texts. Therefore, the defensive effectof DP-Prompt is limited.",
  "DHuman Annotation": "We sample 10 responses from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4across six tasks, yielding 120 responses. Two indi-vidual annotators then label them. Previous conver-sations are considered as the ground truth. Recon-structed conversations are generated by the GPTmodels and considered as the prediction. There arethree possible labels: Successful indicates attacksuccess, meaning the model completely leaked theprevious conversation; Failed signifies the attacksfailure, where the model refused to reconstruct theprevious conversation; Partially leaked indicatesthat the model responded to the adversarys queryby summarizing or excerpting segments, resultingin partial information leakage. The two annotatorsresolve the inconsistencies in the labeling processthrough discussion. Some annotated example re-sponses are shown in . More examples canbe found in the link.",
  "E.1Custom GPTs": "OpenAI is in the process of deploying specializediterations of ChatGPT, designated as custom GPTs,which enable users to craft versions tailored to dis-tinct objectives. These custom GPTs introduce anovel paradigm, allowing individuals to develop acustom variant of ChatGPT that enhances utility invarious aspects of daily life.The process of constructing a custom GPT isstreamlined, requiring no programming expertise.It empowers users to create models for personaluse, exclusive corporate applications, or for thebroader community. The creation of a custom GPTis as easy as starting a conversation, providing itwith directives and supplementary knowledge (forexample, aggregating users selected prior interac-tions with GPT models), and defining its capabil-ities, which may include internet searches, imagegeneration, or data analysis.Furthermore, OpenAI offers a platform for usersto publish their custom GPTs and even initiate GPTstorefronts. This development enables third-partyusers to effortlessly access publicly available cus-tom GPTs and, potentially, conduct the Conversa-tion Reconstruction Attack to reconstruct historicaldialogues contained within them.",
  "E.2Hijacked Chat Sessions": "Using GPT models via third-party intermediaryproxy tools will possibly introduce an extra at-tack surface of the Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) at-tack (Joye and Quisquater, 1997; Shirvanian andSaxena, 2014; Wang et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2023).Here, we present the first real-world example ofsuch a threat model. In this example, an adversaryhijacks a ChatGPT conversation session using aMan-in-the-Middle attack to gain black-box accessto ChatGPT models with previous conversations.In our real-world instance, the adversary firstdevelops a malicious browser as an intermediaryproxy tool to conduct the Man-in-the-Middle at-tack.

  ": Examples of different types of reconstructed conversations": "the HTTP protocol involved in their conversationswith ChatGPT fall within the adversarys control,enabling the adversary to manipulate, edit, andmonitor these traffic packets. Most of the time,the malicious browser behaves benignly, refrain-ing from intercepting, modifying, or eavesdroppingon network traffic packets, and does not communi- cate with the adversary. However, after the adver-sary activates the malicious features within sucha browser, they can intercept and modify querytraffic packets when users send new queries toChatGPT. The adversary only needs to modify theparts section of the query traffic packets (key-words to identify the query traffic packets: POST : A real-world instance of attacking the cus-tom GPTs.

Subsequently, theadversary only needs to monitor the returned traf-fic packets (keywords to identify the returned traf-fic packets: Content-Type text/event-stream)from ChatGPT to obtain the generated content.Once the adversary gains black-box access to theChatGPT model through this type of attack, theycan further engage in the Conversation Reconstruc-tion Attack, forcing the ChatGPT model to disclosethe previous conversation history with the user,even if the conversation history is not monitored oronly appears previously in benign browsers.Note that, in the real world, the intermediaryproxy tool developed by the adversary may takeon other, more covert forms, such as a VPN. Butthe fundamental mechanism remains consistent:if other malicious intermediary tools succeed inintercepting communication traffic, the adversarycan easily transfer the techniques for identifyingand modifying related traffic packets, as used in thebrowser-based attack, to these tools."
