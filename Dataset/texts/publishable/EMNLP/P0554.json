  "Abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) havedemonstrated exceptional performance acrossvarious tasks following human alignment, theymay still generate responses that sound plau-sible but contradict factual knowledge, a phe-nomenon known as hallucination. In this pa-per, we demonstrate the feasibility of mitigat-ing hallucinations by verifying and minimiz-ing the inconsistency between external knowl-edge present in the alignment data and theintrinsic knowledge embedded within founda-tion LLMs. Specifically, we propose a novelapproach called Knowledge Consistent Align-ment (KCA), which employs a well-alignedLLM to automatically formulate assessmentsbased on external knowledge to evaluate theknowledge boundaries of foundation LLMs.To address knowledge inconsistencies in thealignment data, KCA implements several spe-cific strategies to deal with these data instances.We demonstrate the superior efficacy of KCAin reducing hallucinations across six bench-marks, utilizing foundation LLMs of varyingbackbones and scales. This confirms the ef-fectiveness of mitigating hallucinations by re-ducing knowledge inconsistency. Our code,model weights, and data are openly accessibleat",
  "Introduction": "Fine-tuning foundation large language mod-els (LLMs) in line with human preferences,such as helpfulness, harmlessness, and truthful-ness (Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022),have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness.

However, it should benoted that there may be certain knowledge con-tained in the alignment data only, but not in thepretraining corpus. As illustrated in , theknowledge snippet regarding Direct PreferenceOptimization, a recently introduced techniquefor LLM alignment (Rafailov et al., 2023), is ab-sent from the pretraining corpus of the foundationLLMs, leading to a phenomenon termed as knowl-edge inconsistency between the external knowledgein alignment data and the intrinsic knowledge em-bedded within foundation LLMs.Knowledge inconsistency could lead the fine-tuned LLMs to adapt to external knowledge theyencounter but do not fully comprehend, resultingin hallucinated responses. Our preliminary analy-sis in reveals a direct correlation betweenthe percentages of knowledge inconsistency andthe rates of hallucination across various foundationLLMs and benchmarks.1 Therefore, an interestingquestion arises: how to identify alignment data in-stances that trigger knowledge inconsistency beforeconducting alignment to mitigate hallucinations.Recent studies attempt to identify inconsistentinstances by evaluating if foundation LLMs cangenerate correct responses for alignment questions.",

Then, they calibrate the inconsistency by appendinga sentence to the ground truth answer that describesthe uncertainty of their capabilities during align-ment (Yang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a). How-ever, these approaches suffer from two major limita-tions. Firstly, they are designed for tasks like ques-tion answering, which can be evaluated via a binarytrue/false or a single accuracy score. For complextasks, such as Describe the process of photosyn-thesis in detail., it becomes challenging to ascer-tain the confidence level in the gold references.This limits their applicability to simple tasks likequestion answering and scalability to complex real-world scenarios. Secondly, these methods solelydepend on instructions and responses for detectingknowledge inconsistency, neglecting the explicitintegration of reference knowledge that LLMs re-quire to answer the instructions. Consequently, thislimitation leads to difficulties in attributing andinterpreting the knowledge inconsistency.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mit-igating knowledge inconsistency through Knowl-edge Consistent Alignment (KCA). For each align-ment data instruction, KCA first examines the foun-dation LLM through a full test of the knowledgerequired to answer the instruction. To automati-cally generate testing questions, we leverage exist-ing well-aligned LLMs, such as GPT-3.5, to createmultiple-choice examinations related to the knowl-edge required to answer the instructions. Then, weutilize the testing scores on the constructed ques-tions to identify instructions with low scores asinstances that require external knowledge and in-dicate knowledge inconsistency issues. For eachinstruction requiring external knowledge, we also acquire a reference knowledge snippet related to it.Next, we investigate three tuning methods to adjustdata involving knowledge inconsistency, includingappending the knowledge snippets to the instruc-tions, discarding the instances, and modifying theresponses into refusal format, respectively.To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness ofour proposed approach, we investigate the miti-gation of hallucinations in instruction-tuning se-tups. We employ various foundation LLMs in-cluding Pythia 7B (Biderman et al., 2023), Mis-tral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023), Llama-2 7B and13B (Touvron et al., 2023a,b). We utilize six bench-marks ranging general instruction-following, truth-ful question answering, retrieval-augmented gen-eration, and clinical report generation with bothmetric-based and LLM-based judgments. Experi-mental results show that KCA significantly reducesknowledge inconsistency, thereby reducing hallu-cination rates compared to the baseline. Moreover,we explore the potential impact of reducing knowl-edge inconsistency on other human preferences,such as helpfulness. The results reveal that most ofthe tuning methods within KCA demonstrate com-parable performance to the baseline in maintaininghelpfulness. Notably, among the three tuning meth-ods, refusal tuning exhibits superior performance inmitigating hallucinations, open-book tuning excelsin maintaining helpfulness, while discard tuningprovides a balance between hallucination mitiga-tion and helpfulness maintenance.To sum up, this work distinguishes itself fromprevious studies in two significant aspects. Firstly,our method detects knowledge inconsistency bydesigning assessments related to the knowledge inalignment data, regardless of task types and com-plexities, which can be scaled to more complex real-world scenarios. Secondly, our approach explicitlyleverages reference knowledge to detect knowledgeinconsistency, thereby facilitating the attribution ofinconsistencies within alignment data and reveal-ing the comprehension level of foundation LLMsacross various knowledge domains. This could con-tribute to the development of more comprehensiveand robust LLMs from a knowledge perspective.",
  "The challenge of knowledge hallucination in LLMs(Huang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b) hasemerged following their remarkable performanceacross a diverse range of NLP tasks, especially af-": "ter human alignment. Recent research efforts havefocused on addressing hallucination throughout theentire development process of LLMs, includingtraining, inference, and data curation.For the training processing, Lee et al. (2022)propose to use topic prefixes when designing thetraining objective to enhance awareness of facts.Fact-RLHF (Sun et al., 2023a) develops a fact-augmented approach of reinforcement learningfrom human feedback to supplement the rewardmodel with additional factual information. As forthe inference process, DoLA (Chuang et al., 2023)is based on the assumption that factual knowledgeis localized in specific layers of LLMs. It then in-troduces a decoding method that contrasts the out-put distributions obtained from the final layer ver-sus intermediate layers. CoVe (Dhuliawala et al.,2023) leverages LLMs strong ability to examineresponses they produce and correct mistakes. Ad-ditionally, KGR (Guan et al., 2023) introducesan external knowledge graph during the reason-ing process to provide factual knowledge for refin-ing drafts generated by LLMs. For data curation,Zhang et al. (2023a) and Yang et al. (2023) proposeto identify the knowledge boundary of LLMs byrelying on annotated question-answer pairs to eval-uate whether LLMs can generate correct responses.They then append a sentence to the ground truth an-swer describing the uncertainty of their capabilitiesbefore conducting alignment.The proposed KCA approach in this paper fallswithin the data curation category. In contrast tothese methods, which are applicable only to simpletasks like question answering, our method uses awell-aligned LLM to design assessments related tothe knowledge in alignment data and can be appliedto various tasks of different complexities. More-over, our approach explicitly leverages referenceknowledge to detect knowledge inconsistency, fa-cilitating the attribution of inconsistencies withinalignment data and revealing the capabilities offoundation LLMs in various knowledge domains.",
  "Problem Settings": "Given a training dataset D = (Ii, Ri)1iN forinstruction-tuning, which consists of N instruc-tions (I) and responses (R), we first employ awell-aligned LLM G to categorize D into two dis-tinct subsets based on the task requirements forexternal knowledge: Dkn, which requires externalknowledge, and Dunk, which does not. For eachinstruction Ii within Dkn, since it is non-trivial toretrieve the knowledge that the foundation LLMM requires to answer it, we leverage G to gen-erate a reference knowledge snippet Ki for sup-plementation. Then, we introduce an innovativeapproach to assess Ms understanding degree ofKi by formulating a multiple-choice examinationEi = (Qi, Oi, Ai), where Qi, Oi, and Ai referto the questions, options, and answers in Ei, re-spectively. After that, we ask M to answer eachquestion in Ei and obtain the accuracy score Si forIi. Ii will be classified into the inconsistent subsetDinc or the consistent subset Dco based on the ac-curacy score. Finally, we develop three strategiesfor calibrating inconsistency in Dinc before fine-tuning M on the entire dataset D. The overview ofthe proposed KCA is illustrated in .",
  "Knowledge Inconsistency Detection": "To detect the inconsistency between external knowl-edge within the instruction-tuning (alignment) dataand intrinsic knowledge embedded in M obtainedfrom pretraining, we propose a four-stage approach:(i) knowledge requirement classification, (ii) refer-ence knowledge generation, (iii) examination for-mulation, and (iv) examination completion. KnowledgeRequirementClassificationIninstruction-tuning, tasks such as knowledge-basedquestion-answering often demand the incorpora-tion of external knowledge, while other tasks liketext rewriting may require minimal external knowl-edge. Hence, we categorize the instances (Ii, Ri)in D into Dkn and Dunk based on if they require forexternal knowledge. To achieve this, we prompta well-aligned LLM G to perform the classifica-tion.

  "Answer": ": The overview of the proposed KCA approach to mitigate hallucinations through knowledge consistentalignment. KCA first detects knowledge inconsistency through formulated examinations (Left), followed bycalibrating inconsistent alignment instances using open-book, discard, or refusal tuning (Right). based on provided demonstrations. We also ask Gto generate a rationale for the classification basedon the chain-of-though (CoT) technique (Wei et al.,2022). The detailed prompt for knowledge require-ment classification is provided in Appendix D.1. Knowledge GenerationFor each in-struction Ii in the subset Dkn which requires exter-nal knowledge, we further obtain a reference knowl-edge snippet Ki for it. While relying on humanannotations seems intuitive, it is unrealistic due toassociated costs and potential issues (Sun et al.,2023b). Moreover, retrieving the knowledge thatM needs to answer the instruction is non-trivial.Recent studies have shown that LLMs can serve asknowledge bases for question answering (Petroniet al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021). Therefore, weprompt G to generate the corresponding knowledgesnippet Ki for each Ii. Given the relatively longlength of the generated Ki, we do not employ ICLor CoT. The detailed prompt for reference knowl-edge generation is provided in Appendix D.2. Examination FormulationTo detect the incon-sistency between the external knowledge withinDkn and the intrinsic knowledge embedded inM, we introduce a novel approach inspiredby knowledge evaluation benchmarks such asMMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020).Specifically,we leverage the above reference knowledge andprompt G to formulate Ei = (Qi, Oi, Ai), whichcomprises M multiple-choice questions Qi, op-tions Oi, and answer labels Ai. We employ ICLto assist G in generating examinations with the re-",
  "quired format and CoT to prompt G to provide thecorrect label. For detailed prompts for the exami-nation formulation, please refer to Appendix D.3": "Examination CompletionFollowing the formu-lated examinations, we evaluate the foundationLLM M on each Ei. Specifically, we append eachquestion in Qi with the corresponding options inOi to construct the input sequence. We then calcu-late the probabilities of M to generate four choicesbased on this sequence and select the choice withthe highest probability as the prediction result. Fi-nally, we calculate the accuracy score Si for eachEi using the predictions and labels. If Si falls belowa given threshold , we regard the correspondinginstance (Ii, Ri) as inconsistent in terms of knowl-edge and put it into Dinc; otherwise, it is regardedas consistent and put into Dco. As a result, wedivide Dkn into Dkn = {Dinc, Dco}.",
  "Knowledge Inconsistency Calibration": "As mentioned before, knowledge inconsistencycould mislead foundation LLMs during alignmentand lead to hallucinations. We propose three spe-cific strategies to manage instances in Dinc, in-cluding (i) open-book tuning, which appends thegenerated knowledge snippets to the instructions,(ii) discard tuning, which discards both the instruc-tions and responses, and (iii) refusal tuning, whichchanges the responses to a refusal format.",
  "Open-Book TuningTo prevent the foundationLLMs from learning inconsistent external knowl-edge, we append the generated reference knowl-": "edge Ki with each instruction Ii in Dinc. Then,we fine-tune M using Dunk, Dco, and the updatedDinc. The additional contextual information pro-vided with the instruction is intended to remind Mto ignore inconsistent knowledge during alignment. Discard TuningPrevious studies suggest thatmaintaining a compact yet diverse dataset is cru-cial for instruction-tuning to ensure better per-formance (Chen et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023).Therefore, we propose that simply discarding in-stances containing inconsistent knowledge wouldhelp mitigate hallucinations. Therefore, we discardDinc and fine-tune M using only Dunk and Dco. Refusal TuningA well-aligned LLM should hon-estly respond to queries it comprehends and ac-knowledge those it does not (Yang et al., 2023).Accordingly, we modify the response Ri in Dincto a refusal format and use the updated Dinc, Dco,and Dunk together for fine-tuning M. Similar toopen-book tuning, which supplements knowledgein instructions, refusal tuning, which declines torespond, also prevents the foundation LLMs fromacquiring knowledge beyond their capabilities.",

Secondly,open-book tuning preserves helpfulness by retain-ing comprehensive information about the instruc-tions and responses. Nevertheless, this method maynot be suitable when the foundation LLM displaysa high degree of knowledge inconsistency, as ob- served in Pythia during our experiments. Thirdly,discard tuning, which does not alter either instruc-tions or responses, ensures consistency betweenthe training and testing processes. This strategyachieves a balance between mitigating hallucina-tions and maintaining helpfulness.",
  "Conclusion": "In this study, we explore the inconsistency betweenexternal knowledge within the instruction-tuningdata for alignment and the intrinsic knowledge thatfoundation LLMs memorized from the pretrainingcorpus. We demonstrate the correlation betweenknowledge inconsistency and hallucinations. Toaddress this issue, we introduce Knowledge Consis-tent Alignment (KCA). KCA formulates test exam-inations for the external knowledge required to an-swer the instructions and evaluates the LLMs com-prehension based on the examination scores. More-over, KCA introduces several simple yet effectivestrategies for knowledge inconsistency calibration,including open-book tuning, discard tuning, and re-fusal tuning. Through a series of experiments, wedemonstrate that mitigating knowledge inconsis-tency leads to a reduction in the hallucination rate.Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of theproposed KCA across LLMs of different scalesand backbones on six benchmarks, employing bothmetric-based and LLM-based judgment.Compared to previous studies, the proposedKCA demonstrates scalability to scenarios involv-ing diverse task types and complexities. Moreover,our approach explicitly utilizes reference knowl- edge to detect knowledge inconsistency, therebyfacilitating the attribution of inconsistencies withinalignment data. This allows for a comprehensiveunderstanding of the comprehension level of foun-dation LLMs across various knowledge domains.",
  "Limitations": "The potential limitations of the proposed KCA ap-proach are twofold. First, our approach relies onthe powerful capabilities of GPT-3.5 for knowledgeconsistency detection, which may pose challengesin terms of resource requirements. Second, thiswork primarily focuses on verifying knowledgein supervised fine-tuning data before conductingalignment to prevent hallucinations, rather than ex-ploring new training strategies aimed at producingLLMs that are inherently less prone to hallucina-tions. Developing such strategies could be a morefundamental approach to addressing hallucinations.",

Monopolies can charge higherprices due to their market dominance, reducing consumer welfare and surplus. Additionally, they oftenrestrict output to maintain higher prices, further diminishing consumer access to goods and services.

  "Mitigating Hallucinations": "Instruction: Prove the existence of uncountable sets using Cantors diagonalization.Knowledge: Cantors diagonalization is a proof technique used in mathematics to demonstrate theexistence of uncountable sets. It was developed by the German mathematician Georg Cantor in thelate 19th century. In mathematics, sets can be classified as either countable or uncountable. Countablesets are those that have a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...),meaning their elements can be enumerated in a sequence. Uncountable sets, on the other hand, do nothave a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers and cannot be enumerated. To prove theexistence of uncountable sets, Cantors diagonalization argument uses a proof by contradiction. Theproof assumes that a set is countable, and then constructs a new element that is not contained in theassumed enumeration, thereby demonstrating that the set is actually uncountable. Heres a step-by-stepexplanation of Cantors diagonalization argument: Assume that we have a countable set, for example, aset of real numbers between 0 and 1. Represent the elements of the set using an infinite table, whereeach row corresponds to an element and each column represents a digit after the decimal point. Supposethe assumed enumeration of the set is given by listing the elements row by row. Construct a new element,which is different from all the elements in the assumed enumeration, by choosing a digit not equalto the corresponding digit in the diagonal of the enumeration. The newly constructed element is notcontained in the assumed enumeration because it differs from each of the enumerated elements in atleast one decimal place. Therefore, the assumed enumeration is incomplete and does not include all theelements of the set. Since the assumed enumeration was arbitrary, this shows that there cannot exist anyenumeration of the set that covers all its elements. Consequently, the set is proven to be uncountable.StandardSure, I can help you with that! Cantors diagonalization is a proof technique thatshows that some sets are uncountable. The basic idea is to construct a sequence ofelements in a set that is supposed to be countable, and then show that there is a missingelement in that sequence. Lets consider the set of all natural numbers, which iscountable. We can construct a sequence of natural numbers as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...Now, lets add a new element to this sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 6 This new element ismissing from the sequence, and it is not part of any previous element in the sequence.Therefore, we can add any new element to the sequence, and it will be missing fromthe sequence. This means that the set of all natural numbers is not countable, becausewe can always add a new element to the sequence. This is just one example of howCantors diagonalization can be used to prove the existence of uncountable sets. Thereare many other examples, such as the set of real numbers, which is uncountable.Explanation: The assistants response contains a hallucination. The set of naturalnumbers is countable, not uncountable. The assistant incorrectly explained Can-tors diagonalization argument by using the set of natural numbers as an example,which contradicts the provided knowledge. The correct application of Cantors diag-onalization argument involves assuming a set is countable, then constructing a newelement not contained in the assumed enumeration, thereby demonstrating the set isuncountable. The assistants explanation does not follow this logic. Open-BookCantors diagonalization is a proof technique used in mathematics to show that certainsets are uncountable. It works by constructing a sequence of elements in a set thatis supposed to be countable, but which has an element that is not in the sequence.This shows that the set is not countable, and therefore must be uncountable. Heresan example of how Cantors diagonalization can be used to prove the existence ofuncountable sets: Lets consider the set of all natural numbers, denoted by N. We canconstruct a sequence of natural numbers as follows: 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ..., 1/n, ... Thissequence is called the sequence of rational numbers between 0 and 1. It is clear thatthis sequence is infinite, since we can keep adding fractions to the end of it forever.Now, lets consider the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1. We can construct asequence of real numbers as follows: 0.1, 0.11, 0.111, 0.1111, ..., 0.11111, ... Thissequence is called the sequence of decimal expansions of rational numbers between 0and 1. It is clear that this sequence is infinite, since we can keep adding digits to theend of it forever. Now, lets consider the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1. Wecan construct a sequence of real numbers as follows: 0.1, 0.11, 0.111, ...Explanation: The assistants response contains hallucinations. The assistant incorrectlydescribes the set of natural numbers and the sequence of rational numbers between 0and 1. The assistant also incorrectly describes the sequence of decimal expansionsof rational numbers between 0 and 1. These descriptions do not align with Cantorsdiagonalization argument as described in the provided knowledge. DiscardCantors diagonalization is a proof technique used in mathematics to show that certainsets are uncountable. It works by constructing a sequence of elements in a set thatis supposed to be countable, but which has an element that is not in the sequence.This shows that the set is not countable, and therefore must be uncountable. Heresan example of how Cantors diagonalization can be used to prove the existence ofuncountable sets: Lets consider the set of all natural numbers, denoted by N. We canconstruct a sequence of natural numbers as follows: 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ..., 1/n, 1/n+1, ...,1/2n, 1/2n+1, ..., 1/n2, 1/n3, ... This sequence is called the diagonal sequence, and ithas the property that every natural number appears in the sequence exactly once. Wecan see that the diagonal sequence, the continued fraction expansion of 1/2, and thedecimal expansion of 1/2 are all different sequences of rational numbers, but they allhave the property that every rational number appears in the sequence exactly once.This shows that the set of all rational numbers is not countable, and therefore must beuncountable.Explanation: The assistants response contains several hallucinations. The sequencesit describes for the sets of natural numbers, rational numbers, and real numbers areincorrect and do not accurately represent Cantors diagonalization argument. Further-more, the assistant incorrectly states that the set of rational numbers is uncountable,which contradicts the known mathematical fact that the set of rational numbers iscountable."
