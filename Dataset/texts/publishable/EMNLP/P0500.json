  "Abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have trans-formed machine learning but raised significantlegal concerns due to their potential to pro-duce text that infringes on copyrights, result-ing in several high-profile lawsuits. The le-gal landscape is struggling to keep pace withthese rapid advancements, with ongoing de-bates about whether generated text might pla-giarize copyrighted materials. Current LLMsmay infringe on copyrights or overly restrictnon-copyrighted texts, leading to these chal-lenges: (i) the need for a comprehensive eval-uation benchmark to assess copyright compli-ance from multiple aspects; (ii) evaluating ro-bustness against safeguard bypassing attacks;and (iii) developing effective defenses targetedagainst the generation of copyrighted text. Totackle these challenges, we introduce a curateddataset to evaluate methods, test attack strate-gies, and propose lightweight, a real-time de-fense mechanism to prevent the generation ofcopyrighted text, ensuring the safe and law-ful use of LLMs. Our experiments demon-strate that current LLMs frequently outputcopyrighted text, and that jailbreaking attackscan significantly increase the volume of copy-righted output. Our proposed defense mecha-nism significantly reduce the volume of copy-righted text generated by LLMs by effectivelyrefusing malicious requests.",
  "Introduction": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolution-ized the field of machine learning by providing away to generate human-like text. However, thelegalities of generated text are still being debated(Karamolegkou et al., 2023; Min et al., 2023; Hen-derson et al., 2023). One of the main concerns isthat the generated text might be plagiarized fromcopyrighted materials (Chang et al., 2023; Carliniet al., 2021, 2022). This issue has led to several",
  ": An example of LLM outputting copyrightedtexts or overprotection": "high-profile lawsuits (Adams, 2023; Maheshwariand Tracy, 2023; Tracy and Maheshwari, 2023).Some studies (Chang et al., 2023; Karamolegkouet al., 2023) have shown that LLMs can indeedverbalize segments of copyrighted works, raisingalarms about their compliance with intellectualproperty laws. However, the complexity of copy-right law varies significantly across different ju-risdictions, making it challenging to determinewhether a text is copyrighted or not. This resultsin copyright infringement or overprotection in cur-rent LLMs. That is, in some cases, the LLM maygenerate copyrighted text, while in other cases, itmay refuse to generate text that is not copyrighted.Examples of such cases are shown in Fig 1. Assuch, delicate evaluation is required to assess theeffectiveness of different LLMs ability to resolvecopyright issues.Previous works (Karamolegkou et al., 2023;",
  "Chang et al., 2023) on probing LLMs for copy-": "righted text lack a comprehensive evaluation cover-ing multiple aspects. This includes a lack of bothdatasets and evaluation metrics. For datasets, pub-lic domain (Stim, 2013) materials are free for any-one to use without restrictions, and LLMs shouldfocus on generating such content while avoidingcopyrighted materials. Due to varying copyrightlaws, a robust dataset distinguishing copyrightedand public domain texts is essential. For metrics,a low volume in the generated text may indicateeither the models inability to memorize (Carliniet al., 2022) or the model is lawful. Current evalua-tion metrics are insufficient, as they only considerthe volume of copyrighted text and not the modelsability to refuse improper requests. Therefore, weconstruct a meticulously curated dataset of (i) copy-righted text; (ii) non-copyrighted text; and (iii) textwith varying copyright status across different coun-tries, such as text that is copyrighted in the UK butnon-copyrighted in the US. This dataset is manu-ally evaluated to ensure correct labeling. In addition, there is no work that specificallyaims to attack the copyright protection mechanismsof LLMs. Thus, we evaluate the robustness, byadopting jailbreaking attacks (Liu et al., 2024b)to the realm of copyright protection. We also in-troude the rate of refusal, a common evaluationmetric in the jailbreaking field (Zou et al., 2023;Qi et al., 2023), in our evaluation protocol. This isto evaluate the models ability to properly refuseto generate copyrighted text. Our findings indicatethat these attacks can lead to an increased volumeof copyrighted text being generated by LLMs. Thissuggests that current LLMs remain vulnerable torequests for copyrighted material, motivating theneed to develop defense mechanisms focused oncopyright protection. Although various methods may be used to pre-vent LLMs from generating copyrighted text, theyall have limitations. For instance, unlearning (Chenand Yang, 2023) the copyrighted text from thetraining data can cause information loss, as re-moving copyrighted texts may impair LLM per-formance (Min et al., 2023), such as failing torecognize well-known characters like Harry Pot-ter (Eldan and Russinovich, 2023). Overprotectivealignment methods can lead to false positives (Qiet al., 2023), blocking non-copyrighted texts andhindering research. Also, with constantly changingcopyright statuses, frequent re-training is imprac-tical. Recently, MemFree (Ippolito et al., 2023) decoding is proposed to use N-Gram model to de-tect verbatim copying, but it may lead to halluci-nation due to modifying the decoding process, forwhich an example is given in Fig 2. Moreover,these defense mechanisms often require access tomodel parameters, which is impractical for API-based models. Additionally, they lack real-timeweb information, preventing adaptation to the dy-namic nature of copyright status. As a result, wepropose an easy-to-deploy, Agent-based defensemechanism that prevents any LLM from generatingcopyrighted text by checking real-time informationfrom web searches. Our approach involves rec-ognizing and remembering copyrighted content,letting the LLM clearly reject the request whencopyrighted text is relevant. Moreover, our defensemechanism does not interfere when no copyrightedtext is relevant to the request.In this work, we integrate the benchmark, ro-bustness, and defense method as a comprehensiveframework, namely SHIELD, standing for Systemfor Handling Intellectual Property and Evaluationof LLM-Generated Text for Legal Defense. Ourcontributions are summarized as follows: We construct a meticulously curated dataset ofcopyrighted and non-copyrighted text to evalu-ate various approaches. The dataset is manuallyreviewed to ensure accurate labeling. To our knowledge, we are the first to evaluatedefense mechanisms against jailbreaking attacksgenerating copyrighted text. We show that thesafeguards on copyright compliance can be by-passed by malicious users with simple promptengineering. We propose novel agent-based defense to preventLLMs from generating copyrighted text, whichbest protects intellectual property against mali-cious requests including jailbreaking attacks. Ourdefense mechanism is lightweight, easy to deploy,and usable in real-time, addressing the need forrobustness and explainability.",

The first box shows the user prompt. Thesecond box shows the text generated by the original model, the third box shows the text generated by the modelwith MemFree decoding, and the fourth box shows the refusal response of the model with our Agent-based defensemechanism. The copied text is shown in purple , and the hallucinated text is shown in red. We can depict that whilethe model with MemFree decoding generates less copied text than the original model, it suffers from hallucination.On the countrary, the model with our Agent-based defense mechanism refuses to generate the copyrighted text,which is the desired behavior. sure the similarity between the generated text andthe original text. They find that the similarity be-tween the generated text and the original text ishigh, indicating that the model may have copied theoriginal text. Chang et al. (2023) uses cloze prob-ing (i.e., asking models to predict masked tokens)to evaluate the memorization of copyrighted text bylanguage models. However, predicting masked to-kens may not directly reflect the models ability togenerate copyrighted text, as the model may refuseto generate copyrighted text even if it has memo-rized it. DSouza and Mimno (2023) states thatthe model may memorize poetry materials, and thememorization is highly correlated with certain po-etry collections. Li et al. (2024) propose a methodto detect whether the copyrighted text is includedin the models training data. There are also con-current works on evaluation of copyright issues inLLMs. Wei et al. (2024) provides an evaluationof different copyright takedown (defense mecha-nism) methods; Mueller et al. (2024) defines newmetrics in probing copyright infringement; Chen et al. (2024a) provides new insights about non-literal copyright infringement. These works areimportant in identifying the potential copyright is-sues in language models. However, they are limitedin scope. Our work aims at a systematic evalua-tion, beyond simply probing the models behavior,to provide a comprehensive understanding of themodels behavior, including vulnerabilities to at-tacks, and the models ability to faithfully outputpublic domain text. Mitigating copyright issues Several categories ofmethods have been proposed. (i) Machine unlearn-ing methods (Liu et al., 2024a,c; Yao et al., 2023;Chen and Yang, 2023; Hans et al., 2024) focus onthe ability of machine learning models to forgetspecific data upon request. In the context of copy-right protection, machine unlearning can be usedto remove copyrighted text. However, unlearningall copyrighted text may significantly downgradethe models performance (Min et al., 2023). Atthe same time, totally forgetting copyrighted textis unnecessary as fair use of copyrighted text is legal in most countries. (ii) LLM Alignment meth-ods (Shen et al., 2023) aim to align the modelsoutput with human expectations, following regula-tions and guidelines. With alignment, the modelcan be guided to refuse to output copyrighted textor to output a summary of the text instead. How-ever, alignment may cause overprotection (Qi et al.,2023), leading to the models refusal to output textthat is not copyrighted. (iii) Decoding (Ippolitoet al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024) methods modify logitsof the model when decoding to avoid generatingcopyrighted text. However, this may incur hallu-cination issues (Wang et al., 2023) as the modelis forced to avoid generating certain text. OtherLLM enhancement methods could also be used inmitigating copyright issue, such as model merg-ing (Abad et al., 2024). These methods are impor-tant in mitigating the copyright issues of LLMs.However, they have limitations such as the need forfine-tuning, the lack of transparency, and the poten-tial of being overprotective. Our work provides anAgent-based protection mechanism, which can beeasily implemented and updated, without the needfor re-training or fine-tuning the model. Comparedwith the existing methods, our method is less likelyto hallucinate, and better prevents the generationof copyrighted text.Attacks to LLMs To the best of our knowledge,there is no prior work that directly provides at-tacks tailored to LLMs for generating copyrightedtext. This may be due to the fact that the LLMsmay often copy the copyrighted text even withoutspecifically designed attacks. However, there areworks that provide attacks to LLMs for generat-ing text that does not follow the safety guidelines,such as generating hate speech, misinformation, orbiased text. These methods are typically called jail-break attacks (Liu et al., 2024b; Shen et al., 2024;Wei et al., 2023; Chu et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2023;Cai et al., 2024), which aim to bypass the safetyconstraints of the model. Our work is the first toprovide a systematic evaluation of jailbreak attackson LLMs for generating copyrighted text.",
  "The SHIELD Evaluation Protocol": "Benchmarking Given that determining the copy-right status of text materials is a complex andtime-consuming process, we propose several newdatasets to evaluate copyright infringement inLLMs. Since we lack access to the training data of the LLMs, our approach is to focus on widelyrecognized works in society. We achieve this by se-lecting best-selling books and top-ranking contentfrom platforms like Spotify. This ensures that thecopyrighted material we consider is both influen-tial and likely to have been included in the LLMstraining data. These datasets are constructed bycollecting text materials from different sources,such as books, music lyrics, and poems, selectedfrom best-selling books (Goodreads, 2024), Spo-tify streaming records (Wikipedia, 2024), and bestEnglish poems (DiscoverPoetry.com, 2024). Theselection of the text materials is based on publicrankings or lists such as Wikipedia. The datasetsare: (1) Best Selling Books - Non Copyrighted (BS-NC) containing 100 text materials from best sellingbooks that is not copyrighted in most countries ;and (2) Best Selling Books - Copyrighted (BS-C)containing 50 text materials from best selling booksthat is copyrighted in most countries ; and (3) BestSelling Books - Partially Copyrighted (BS-PC) con-taining 20 text materials from best selling booksthat is copyrighted in some countries, but notcopyrighted in other countries ; and (4) Spotifystreaming records lyrics (SSRL) containing lyricsof 100 songs that are streamed most frequently onSpotify, which are all copyrighted ; and (5) BestEnglish Poems (BEP) containing 100 popular En-glish poems that are not copyrighted. For all thematerials, we keep only the first 1000 words oftheir original content, ensuring a transformativeuse of the copyrighted materials. Detailed datasetconstruction and lists of titles of all datasets areprovided in Appendix I. Evaluation of Robustness Following Liu et al.(2024b), we introduce 76 existing jailbreak attacksusing prompt engineering, to give a robustness eval-uation of the defense mechanisms. The jailbreakprompts are detailed in Appendix H. Also, consid-ering we aim to let LLMs refuse to generate copy-righted text, we introduce a new metric, namelyrefusal rate, to evaluate LLMs ability to refuse togenerate copyrighted text. The refusal rate is de-fined as the percentage of responses that the LLMsrefuse to generate copyrighted text. Similar to Zouet al. (2023) that use a set of phrases such as Sure,heres or Sure, here is to determine whether theattack is successful, we use a set of refusal tem-plates to evaluate the refusal rate of the LLMs. Therefusal templates are constructed to identify theresponse of the LLMs on whether it is among one",
  "The SHIELD Defense Mechanism": "Overview In this paper, we aim to prevent copy-right infringement in LLMs without retraining orfine-tuning. The MemFree method (Ippolito et al.,2023), which modifies model logits by an N-Grammodel during decoding, effectively prevents thegeneration of copyrighted text. However, while theN-Gram language model ensures outputs do notcontain verbatim copyrighted text, it may produceunrelated content, failing to meet user expectationsfor copyright-related prompts. Our goal is that, ifa prompt requests verbatim copyrighted text, theLLM should refuse and warn the user. On the otherhand, if the prompt is not related to copyrightedtext, the LLM should generate text as usual. To thisend, we introduce an Agent-based defense mecha-nism that utilizes tools and web services to verifythe copyright status of prompts. This mechanismguides LLMs to generate relevant text that avoidscopyrighted material. The Agent-based defensemechanism consists of three main components, asshown in . They are detailed as follows: Copyright Material Detector is used to detectthe presence of copyrighted text in the generatedoutput. It identifies the material in the promptthat is copyrighted and requires verification.",
  "Copyright Status Verifier is used to call webservices to verify the copyright status of the mate-rial detected by the detector, resulting in differentactions based on the status": "Copyright Status Guide is responsible for guid-ing the LLMs to generate text that is related tothe prompt and does not contain copyrighted text.Based on the verifiers output, the guide providesadditional context to the LLMs to generate textthat avoids copyrighted material.N-Gram Recap Like MemFree, our agent lever-ages the N-Gram language model. Given a corpusof copyrighted text C, the N-Gram language modeltrained on C calculates the probability of a giventext T by:",
  "(1)where wi is the i-th word in the text T and n is theorder of the N-Gram language model": "In MemFree, the N-Gram language model is di-rectly applied in the generation process of LLMs.In contrast, our Agent-based defense mechanismuses the N-Gram language model to detect the pres-ence of copyrighted text in the generated outputand guide the LLMs to generate text that is relatedto the prompt and does not contain copyrightedtext. Copyright Material Detector is used to detectthe presence of copyrighted text in the generatedoutput. For each copyrighted material c in thecorpus C, we train an N-Gram language modelon c, denoted as Pc.To determine whether agiven prompt T contains copyrighted text, the agentfirst calculate the probability of the text T beingcopyrighted using the N-Gram models, that is,P(T|c) = ni=1 Pc(wi|wi1, wi2, . . . , win+1)for all c in the corpus C. If any substring Ts oflength greater than NT in the text T has a high prob-ability of being copyrighted, that is P(Ts|c) > ,where is a threshold, and NT is a hyperparam-eter, then the prompt T is considered to containcopyrighted text. In actual implementation, we canuse not only the input prompt T but also the gener-ated text TG to detect the presence of copyrightedtext. The difference between these two choices isdetailed in Appendix F.1. If multiple copyrightedmaterials are detected in the prompt, the agent willconsider all those materials. The detected copy-righted material will be evaluated by the copyrightstatus verifier, which determines whether the mate-rial is copyrighted or in the public domain. Copyright Status Verifier is used to call web ser-vices to verify the copyright status of the prompt.Specifically, considering each copyright material cfrom the detector, the model calls web services toverify the copyright status of c, which is then usedto guide the LLMs to generate text that is related tothe prompt and does not contain copyrighted text.In the production environment, the copyright statusverifier can be implemented in an asynchronousmanner, where the request sent to the web serviceis processed in the background. Also, the copyrightstatus can be cached, with a time-to-live (TTL) ofdesired length. This guarantees the real-time re-sponse of the agent. The detail of the web servicesused in the copyright status verifier is detailed inAppendix F.2.",
  ": The architecture of our SHIELD Defense Mechanism": "there are no copyrighted materials in the prompt, orthe verifier determines that all the material detectedis in the public domain, the agent allows the LLMsto generate text as usual. If the verifier determinesthat the material detected is copyrighted, the agentwill guide the LLMs to generate text that is relatedto the prompt and does not contain copyrighted text.Specifically, the agent utilizes in-context few-shotexamples to guide the LLMs to generate text thatis related to the prompt and does not contain copy-righted text, providing the LLMs with additionalcontext on whether LLM should reject the user re-quest. If the prompt is asking for a verbatim copyof a copyrighted text, the LLM should refuse togenerate the text, and provide a warning to the user.However, if the prompt is asking for a summary ofone book, or related knowledge, such as the authorof the book, the LLM should generate the text asusual. We detail the prompts used in Appendix F.3.Efficiency discussion It is important to note thatthe defense mechanism is lightweight, and canwork with only limited overhead to the LLM serv-ing system. We provide a detailed efficiency dis-cussion in Appendix F.4. Surprisingly, the over-all process of SHIELD defense mechanism can befaster than without the defense mechanism whenfacing queries that have copyright issues. This isdue to the fact that the overhead of the defensemechanism is low, and the generation of refusalresponses is faster than generating a long text ofcopyrighted materials.",
  "Experimental Setup": "Evaluation Metrics We evaluate the effectivenessof the defense mechanisms and the attacks on theLLMs using the following metrics: Volume of Verbatim Memorized Text: To as-sess the extent of original text reproduced byLLMs, we adopt the Longest Common Sub- string (LCS) metric to evaluate the similaritybetween generated and original texts. While LCSquantifies the length of copied text, it may notfully capture short copyrighted materials (e.g.,lyrics). Therefore, we additionally utilize theROUGE-L score to determine the percentage ofthe original text that is replicated. Refusal rate: We measure the refusal rate of theLLMs by identifying the response of the LLMson whether it is among the constructed refusaltemplates. For copyrighted text, we expect therefusal rate to be high; for non-copyrighted text,we expect the refusal rate to be low.Datasets The evaluation utilizes five datasets: BS-C, BS-PC, SSRL, BS-NC, and BEP, which arefurther detailed in .1. For copyrighteddatasets (BS-C and SSRL), we aim at a lower LCSand ROUGE-L score and a higher refusal rate. Fornon-copyrighted datasets (BS-NC and BEP), weaim at a higher LCS and ROUGE-L score and alower refusal rate. For the partially copyrighteddataset (BS-PC), it is debatable whether the modelshould generate the text or not, thus, we leave it tothe users to decide.Baselines for SHIELD Defense Mechanism Wecompare the defense mechanisms with the follow-ing baselines: (i) Plain: the original model ; (ii)MemFree: the model with MemFree (Ippolito et al.,2023) decoding (only for the open source models).LLMs TestedFor API-based models, we testOpenAIs GPT-3.5 Turbo (OpenAI, 2024b), GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024a); Googles Gemini Pro (Teamet al., 2023) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (Reid et al., 2024);Anthropics Claude-3 Haiku (Anthropic, 2024).For Open source models, we test Metas LLaMA2 7B Chat (Touvron et al., 2023), LLaMA 3 8BInstruct (Meta, 2024); and Mistral AIs Mistral 7BInstruct (Jiang et al., 2023).Prompts and Jailbreak Attacks We use the fol-lowing prompts for the LLMs: (i) Prefix Probing:",

This is dueto the fact that prefix probing prompts are just aparagraph containing the copyrighted text, which islikely to make the model to perform text generationrather than chatting. However, the Claude-3 andGPT-4o still manage to have a high refusal rate,indicating that these models are still able to refuseeven without a request.The Jailbreak attacks have a generally low av-erage score for LCS and ROUGE-L and a highrefusal rate, although they have a very high max-imum score for LCS and ROUGE-L. This mayindicate that most of the jailbreaks are not effective,but some of them are very effective. The ineffec-tiveness of most jailbreak prompts may be due tothe following factors: (1) the jailbreaks are notparticularly designed or not suitable for attackingcopyright protection; (2) the jailbreaks are alreadyupdated and memorized by the models, especiallyfor the API-based models like Claude and GPT.This is also supported by the high refusal rate of these models; (3) the jailbreaks may complicatethe input prompt and confuse the model, leadingto a lower score. Nonetheless, the high maximumscore indicates that the safeguards for copyrightcompliance can be bypassed by malicious userswith simple prompt engineering. This is furtherconfirmed by the fact that, for GPT-4o and Claude-3, the refusal rate drops compared with the DirectProbing attacks, indicating that some jailbreakssuccessfully bypass the models safeguards thatwere effective in the Direct Probing prompts. Weconduct a detailed analysis of the effectiveness ofdifferent jailbreak patterns in Appendix H.1. Wefound that the effectiveness of different jailbreakpatterns varies significantly across different LLMs. Evaluation on Public Domain Texts We evaluatethe LLMs using BS-NC and BEP datasets on theability to faithfully output public domain text. Weprovide the averaged results of Prefix Probing andDirect Probing prompts in . We see thatClaude-3 fails to generate the public domain text,with the lowest volume of text generated and thehighest refusal rate. This indicates that the Claude-3 model is overprotective. On the other hand, theGPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o models perform well ingenerating the public domain text, with the highestvolume of text generated and the lowest refusalrate. Among open-source models, the LLaMA 3generates the highest volume of text, while theMistral 7B generates the lowest volume of text. Overall Analysis Among the API-based models,the GPT-4o model is the most balanced model interms of generating text with different copyrightstatuses. This indicates that the GPT-4o model isaware of the copyright status of the text and is ableto generate text accordingly. However, it still gen-erates a high volume of copyrighted text, whichindicates that the model is not perfect in protectingthe copyrighted text. The Claude-3 model is over-protective, which means it is more likely to refuseto generate any text, regardless of the copyrightstatus. Considering the refusal rate, the Gemini 1.5Pro has the second highest refusal rate in generat-ing public domain text, as well as the almost zerorefusal rate in generating copyrighted text. Thisindicates that the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is not ableto distinguish between the copyrighted text andthe public domain text. Among the open sourcemodels, Llama-3 generates the highest volume oftext in both public domain and copyrighted text,while the Mistral 7B generates the lowest volume",

  "Evaluation of Defense Mechanisms": "We evaluate the defense mechanisms using BS-C,BS-PC, and SSRL datasets. We provide the av-eraged results of Prefix Probing and Direct Prob-ing prompts in . From the table, we canconclude that our SHIELD Defense Mechanism sig-nificantly reduces the volume of copyrighted textgenerated by the LLMs. It further increases the re-fusal rate to almost 100% in API-based models andmostly over 70% when facing copyrighted text re-quests. As expected, the MemFree decoding mech-anism does not affect the refusal rate of the models.However, it does reduce the volume of copyrightedtext generated by the models, although it is notas effective as the SHIELD Defense Mechanism.This is because the MemFree decoding mechanismonly prevents the model from further generating thecopyrighted text after the copyrighted text is gener-ated in the first place, and it cannot refuse to gen-erate the copyrighted text. We also include a casestudy on whether our SHIELD Defense Mechanismwill disrupt queries on public domain texts in Ap-pendix F.8. The result shows that our agent will notincur further overprotection. On the BS-PC dataset, our SHIELD Defense Mechanism performs simi-larly to the BS-C dataset, with higher refusal ratesand lower volumes of text generated. Nonetheless,whether to generate the text on BS-PC is debatable,as the books are indeed in the public domain insome countries.",
  "Conclusions": "We propose SHIELD, a comprehensive frame-work addressing copyright compliance in LLMs.SHIELD integrates robust evaluation benchmarksand lightweight defense mechanisms, to measureand prevent the generation of copyrighted text. Ourfindings show that current LLMs may commit copy-right infringement and overprotect public domainmaterials. We further demonstrate that jailbreakattacks increase the volume of copyrighted textgenerated by LLMs. Finally, we show that our pro-posed defense mechanism significantly reduces thevolume of copyrighted text generated by LLMs, bysuccessfully refusing malicious requests.",

  "ALimitations": "The evaluation may not be exhaustive to all LLM-s/copyrighted materials.The SHIELD defensemechanism is a prototype. To build a production-level evaluation/defense mechanism, new methodsshould be introduced, and more engineering workis needed: The Copyright material detector is based onthe N-Gram language model, which is fast butmay be misled by similar texts, this is a knownlimitation of the N-Gram language model. Itrequires the copyrighted material to be in thedatabase. If the copyrighted material is not in thedatabase, the detector will not work. In the realworld, we may need continuous updates of thecopyrighted material database. The Copyright status verifier is based on Per-plexity AI, which is an online service. The la-tency could be improved if the copyright sta-tus verifier is implemented in-house. The ver-ifier could be run asynchronously and the resultscould be cached. This way, the overhead forreal-time generation is negligible. However, thecached data may be outdated. How to keep thecached data up-to-date is an engineering chal-lenge. For example, a heartbeat mechanism couldbe used to update the cached data periodically. The detector and verifier wait for the generationto finish before they can determine the copyrightstatus of the text. This leads to a long responsetime. In practice, the detection could be done inparallel with the generation, which can reducethe response time. If any copyrighted materialis detected, the generation could be terminatedimmediately. Inaccessibility to training data may lead to biasin the evaluation dataset. We have tried to mit-igate this by selecting the most common worksin society. This is done by selecting best-sellingbooks/leaderboards of Spotify to make sure thecopyrighted material is indeed influential and hasa high chance of being used in the LLMs trainingdata. However, it is still possible that the copy-righted material in the training data of differentmodels may lead to bias in the evaluation datasetof this paper. Others: The analysis in this study focuses on acurated selection of popular books, poems, andsong lyrics, all of which are in English. Conse-quently, the findings may not reflect copyrightedmaterials in other formats (e.g., code, techni- cal books) or languages (e.g., Chinese, Span-ish). Moreover, while we have included a diverserange of LLMs in terms of series and sizes, manynewly released models remain untested. Addi-tionally, although our datasets are more compre-hensive than those used in previous studies, theyare still smaller in scale compared to datasetsused in production environments. The refusalrate is calculated using simple pattern matching.Although we have pointed out the overprotec-tion issue, we currently dont provide a solutionto reduce the overprotection of non-copyrighteddata.",
  "BEthics Statement": "This work focuses on protecting the intellec-tual property of authors and publishers from AI-generated copyright infringement. As the digitalage progresses, the proliferation of accessible in-formation has made it increasingly difficult to safe-guard copyrighted materials. Our system aims toaddress these challenges by leveraging technolo-gies to detect and prevent unauthorized use of copy-righted text. We understand that the implementa-tion of such a system must be handled with sensitiv-ity to the rights of content creators and the ethicalconsiderations surrounding their work. Therefore,we have taken deliberate steps to ensure that ourapproach not only respects intellectual propertyrights but also fosters an environment of fairnessand responsibility.Due to the nature of evaluating copyright in-fringement, the use of copyrighted text is unavoid-able, and there may be copyrighted text in figures,tables, and examples, though the volume is mini-mal. By incorporating small, relevant excerpts, wecan better understand how copyrighted content isused and misused, enabling us to refine our protec-tive measures.To the best of our knowledge, our use of copy-righted materials falls within the fair use doc-trine. Specifically, we use the copyrighted materi-als for research purposes, which inherently involvesa transformative processrepurposing the contentto generate new insights and advancements in thefield of copyright protection. Our use is strictlynon-commercial, ensuring that it does not generateany profit or economic benefit that could detractfrom the original works market. Furthermore, wehave taken great care to ensure that our use of thesematerials does not negatively impact the market value or potential sales of the original works. Byproviding proper attribution to the original authorsand publishers, we acknowledge their contributionsand uphold their intellectual property rights.The datasets that contain copyrighted materialwill not be publicly released but will be availableupon request for research purposes only, ensuringits appropriate use. By controlling access to thedataset, we can maintain oversight of how the datais utilized, preventing potential misuse or unautho-rized distribution. Researchers interested in access-ing the dataset will be required to demonstrate a le-gitimate research interest and agree to comply withethical standards and guidelines. This controlleddistribution approach allows us to support the ad-vancement of research in the field while protectingthe integrity and ownership of the copyrighted ma-terials included in the dataset.We will make our best efforts to update thedataset in the future to ensure the most accurateand up-to-date copyright status of the text materials.However, we have made statements on the copy-right status of some intellectual properties, thesestatements are effective only at the time of writing.We encourage users to verify the copyright status ofthe text materials before using them in their work.In summary, we have taken comprehensive stepsto ensure that our work is ethical and complieswith the fair use doctrine. Our commitment toethical practices is evident in our careful handlingof copyrighted materials, our adherence to non-commercial use, and our stringent attribution prac-tices. We recognize the importance of transparencyand are prepared to provide further information orclarification if needed. By doing so, we aim tocontribute positively to the discourse on intellec-tual property rights and offer a robust solution forprotecting the work of authors and publishers inthe digital era.",
  "CDiscussions on the BS-PC dataset": "BS-PC dataset is designed to evaluate a mixed sta-tus of copyrighted text Copyrighted in some coun-tries, but not copyrighted in other countries. Thisis a common scenario in the real world, where thetext is copyrighted in one country but not in another.For now, we leave how to handle this scenario to fu-ture work. However, we can provide some insightson how to handle this scenario. In the productionsystem, LLM providers could implement geoloca-tion restrictions for APIs Implement geolocation technology to restrict access to the copyrighted con-tent based on the users location. This approachensures compliance with regional copyright laws.This is commonly seen in the industry. For ex-ample, Netflix has different content in differentcountries. We will add this discussion to the paper.",
  "DDetailed experimental settings": "We set the for detecting copyrighted text to 0.5,and for consecutively 5 N-Gram hits, the modelwill identify the query containing the copyrightedmaterial. The title and author of the text are alsoused in the copyright material detector. In all ex-periments, we train a 10-gram model, which isidentical to the setting in (Ippolito et al., 2023).The N-Gram uses the same tokenizer as the opensource LLMs, and for API-based models, we usethe tokenizer of Llama-3. We set the temperatureto 0 for all LLMs to avoid randomness in the gen-eration so that the results are consistent and repro-ducible. In the evaluation of LCS and ROUGE-L,all the spaces like separators are unified into a sin-gle space. The original text and the generated textare truncated to 1000 words, and lowercase. Inthe Prefix Probing, the input prompt contains 50of the original text. Thus, the first 50 words of theoriginal content are not used to evaluate the Pre-fix Probing performance. For API-based models,sometimes we encounter the issue of the responsebeing blocked by safety filters, and we assume thisis a kind of refusal response.",
  "D.1Refusal templates": "We provide a list of refusal templates in .This can be useful for users who want to generaterefusal responses for their chatbots. The refusaltemplates can be divided into several categories: (i)Apologies: The model apologizes for not being ableto provide the requested information, (ii) Inability:The model explains that it is unable to providethe requested information, (iii) Restrictions: Themodel explains that it is restricted from providingthe requested information, (iv) Provide Summary:The model suggests alternative ways to obtain therequested information, in the copyright context, themodel often provide a summary of the text.Using of refusal template is commonly used inthe jailbreaking field (Zou et al., 2023; Qi et al.,2023; Liu et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2023). Besides, asthe goal of copyright protection differs from gen-eral jailbreak, we can still use LCS and ROUGE-L",
  "ECase Study: Automated Jailbreakingwith Pair": "Beyond the fixed prompts designed manually, thereare automated jailbreaking techniques that can by-pass the defense mechanisms by learning or iterat-ing towards an objective. Pair (Chao et al., 2023)is among the state-of-the-art jailbreaking meth-ods that can automatically generate jailbreakingprompts. The method leverages an attacker LLMthat iteratively refines its prompts based on the tar-get LLMs responses to create successful jailbreaks.We use Pair to jailbreak ChatGPT(gpt-3.5-turbo)and Claude-3 (claude-3-haiku-20240307) on theBS-C dataset with direct probing. Pair uses an at-tack model to construct malicious prompts towards the given goal automatically. The target LLMsgeneration on the malicious prompt is then judgedby the scoring function that guides the attack modelin optimizing the malicious prompt iteratively. Ourtarget models are GPT and Claude, and our scoringfunction is LCS. shows the results. We findthat Claude could not act as the attack model as italways refuses to optimize the malicious prompts,so we take GPT as the attack model in all experi-ments. Overall, Pair achieved satisfactory perfor-mance, especially, it achieved the highest averageLCS, highest average ROUGE-L, and lowest re-fusal rates, for both GPT and Claude. However,manually crafted jailbreak templates are still betterfor max LCS and max ROUGE-L. This indicatesthat Pair can be used to automatically generate jail-breaking prompts, but it may not be as effective assome manually crafted jailbreaking prompts.Mitigating the overprotection issue with Pair Inthe current stage, the SHIELDdefense mecha-nism does not incur further overprotection to non-copyrighted data. However, we believe that reduc-ing the overprotection of non-copyrighted data ishard without fine-tuning the LLMs. This is becausethe LLMs still consider the overprotection as im-plementing the safeguard. If we want to remove theoverprotection from outside the LLMs API, it couldbe similar to the jailbreaking problem. One may in-tegrate a jailbreaking method into the agents actionon public domain texts. That is, the agent can bedesigned to \"protect\" the copyrighted data, as wellas to \"jailbreak\" the public domain data. To thisend, we have tested the Pair jailbreaking method onthe BS-NC dataset to demonstrate it can be used toreduce the overprotection of non-copyrighted data.The setting is the same as the BS-C dataset, and theresults are shown in . We find that Pair cansignificantly reduce Claudes overprotection issue.However, GPT doesnt overprotect like Claude, soPair doesnt have much effect on it. With Pair, themaximum LCS of GPT is reduced from 198 to 124.This may indicate that if the LLMs are not over-protecting, directly asking for the non-copyrightedtext is more effective than jailbreaking.",
  "Corpus for the N-Gram model The corpus Cis the copyrighted material that we want to avoidgenerating and is indeed the collected dataset. Inour experiments, we use the copyrighted text we": "collected, including BS-C and SSRL. The corpusC contains representative copyrighted texts thatare commonly seen in society, such as best-sellingbooks and leaderboards of Spotify. We believethat the dataset is representative of influential copy-righted material and has a high chance of beingused in the LLMs training data. We assume thatthe LLM providers will maintain a database ofcopyrighted material. This assumption also alignswith other techniques, such as MemFree and un-learning methods. To generalize beyond the cur-rent experiments, LLM providers could maintaina database of copyrighted material, and update itregularly. Detection time The SHIELD Defense Mechanismuses an N-Gram language model to detect copy-righted text. This detection can happen before thegeneration of the text or after the generation of thetext. The whole process is identical between thetwo cases, except for a slight difference in the few-shot examples. If the detection happens before thegeneration, only input of the user query is used.If the detection happens after the generation, theinput of the user query and the generated text arecombined together, formally [T||TG] where T isthe user query and TG is the generated text. Thesubsequent process will be after the detection iscomplete. In our experiments for Prefix Probingand Direct Probing, we use the detection beforethe generation for speed and simplicity. For Jail-breaking prompts, we use the detection after thegeneration to ensure the generated text is not copy-righted. In the case of the real-world production system,the detection can happen simultaneously with thegeneration. This can be implemented by runningthe detection model in parallel with the generationmodel. The detection model will have an initialinput of the user query of T. When each tokenis generated, the detection model will take the in-put of [T||TG] where TG is the generated text sofar. Sliding windows can be used to ensure thedetection is real-time. Once the detection modeldetects copyrighted text, the generation model canbe stopped immediately, then the refusal generationcan be started. However, as the framework here isonly a prototype showcasing the ability of an agent-based defense mechanism, we do not implementthe real-time detection. Instead , we only imple-ment the detection before or after the generation.The choice of detection time will be made by the",
  "F.2Copyright status verifier": "We use a mixture of Project Gutenberg and Perplex-ity AI as the web search engine for the SHIELD De-fense Mechanism. Project Gutenberg is a volunteer-run digital library that offers free eBooks of publicdomain works. We use the Project Gutenberg web-site to verify the public domain status of the textmaterials. If the text is available on Project Guten-berg, we consider it to be in the public domain.If it is not, we will use Perplexity AI to verifythe copyright status. Perplexity AI is a search-engine-enhanced LLM, specifically, we use thellama-3-sonar-large-32k-online model fromPerplexity AI. For each title, we ask the model torespond with a JSON-formatted response contain-ing the copyright status. The prompt used is Youare a helpful assistant. Can you tell methe copyright status of the book {title}by {author}?Answer with a JSON Stringformattedas:{\"public_domain\":true,\"copyright_year\":\"N/A\", \"copyrighted\":false, \"license\": \"Public Domain\"}. Theagent will cache the response for future use.Design Choice of the copyright status veri-fier Copyrighted texts are usually static and can bestored in the database without changing. However,the copyright status of the text is not always clear,and it can be different in different countries; chang-ing over time; or debatable. In our experiment, wechecked the copyright status of each title manually.This is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Thus,our goal is to automate this process. This moti-vates the Copyright status verifier. Our example solution is first to use Project Gutenbergs databaseto determine whether the text is in the public do-main (Gutenberg could be considered as a subsetof public domain titles). If the text is not found inGutenberg, we then use Perplexity AI to determinethe copyright status of the text. Perplexity AI willdirectly search the web for the copyright status ofthe text. It will not search directly to the databaseslisted in Appendix G. As far as we know, thereis no public database that contains the copyrightstatus of all texts. For example: The US Copyright Office provides a public cat-alog, but it lists the \"register\" actions, not thecopyright status of texts. It is also complicatedto use the US Copyright Offices database be-cause it does not have a clear separation betweenoriginal works and editions.",

  "F.3Few-shot examples": "shows the few-shot example used in theSHIELD Defense Mechanism when copyrighted ma-terial is detected. The examples provide the modelwith a few-shot learning prompt to help it under-stand to what extent it should refuse to complywith the users request. The prompt has two set-tings: (1) used when detect both user prompt andgeneration; and (2) used when only detect userprompt. These two settings are used in differentscenarios described in Section F.1. The examplesare designed to help the model understand the taskand provide a proper response. It uses Harry Potteras an example, which is a well-known copyrightedmaterial, to simulate the real-world scenario. Fordifferent input, we use the same few-shot examples.This means, for other copyrighted materials, thefew-shot examples will still be the same.",
  "F.4Case study: Efficiency": "We can break the time consumption of the defensemechanism into 3 parts: (1) The detector itself isbased on the N-Gram language model, which isfast and can be run in real-time; (2) Searching theweb for copyright status is indeed time-consuming.However, in actual implementation, the verifiercan be run asynchronously and the results can becached. This way, the overhead for real-time gen-eration is negligible. (3) If no copyrighted materialis detected, the guide does not add any additionaloverhead. If copyrighted material is detected, theguide adds an additional in-context few-shot ex-ample prompt to the input. This leads to a longinput prompt. However, the refusal generation isshorter than the generation of the copyrighted text.Take as an example, the model generatesone sentence of refusal with SHIELD , while it gen-erates one paragraph of copyrighted text withoutSHIELD . The main time overhead is due to therequirement for possibly generating 2 outputs (onefor detection and one for refusal) instead of one.In practice, copyrighted material can be detectedsimultaneously with the generation, which can fur-ther reduce the overhead.However, we can simulate this by using twosettings introduced in Section F.1:(1) Ap-ply SHIELDonly on input prompt; (2) ApplySHIELD on input and generation (2*generation).The time consumption of the defense mechanismcan be evaluated by comparing the end-to-end time per query and the word count of the output. Theresults are shown in and . We usethe Llama3-8B-Instruct model served with vLLM,temperature=0, batch size=10, and float16 preci-sion on a single NVIDIA A6000. The Direct Prob-ing is used, and the results are averaged based on5 runs. The Vanilla model is the LLM withoutany protection. T and [T||TG] are the LLMs withSHIELD protection before and after the generation,respectively. Note that for applying the protectionafter the generation, the model will generate theresponse twice. That is, first generate the responsewithout protection, then apply the protection to thegenerated response. The time per query and theword count of the output are compared with theVanilla model.From , where the defense mechanismis triggered, we can conclude that the time perquery is decreased to only 43.17% of the Vanillamodel when applying SHIELD before the genera-tion, and slightly increased to 156.82% when apply-ing SHIELD after the generation. The word countof the output is decreased to 19.26% and 20.44% ofthe Vanilla model when applying SHIELD beforeand after the generation, respectively. The resultsshow that the defense mechanism is efficient anddoes not significantly increase the time per query.This is due to the fact that the refusal generationis shorter than the generation of the copyrightedtext. In many cases where the model is asked togenerate copyrighted text, the Vanilla model willgenerate a long response, while the SHIELD modelwill generate a short refusal response.From , where the defense mechanism isnot triggered, we can conclude that the time perquery is almost identical to the Vanilla model. Thisgives a glimpse of the actual time consumption ofthe defense mechanism, excluding the differencein generation time. The word count of the outputis identical to the Vanilla model, which shows thatthe defense mechanism does not incur any overpro-tective behavior.Overall, the SHIELD defense mechanism is effi-cient and does not incur substantial overhead to theLLM serving system. Thus, we can conclude thatit can be deployed in real-time.",

  "F.6Case study: Manually inducedoverprotection": "We can induce overprotection on the model by pro-viding a few-shot example that is too restrictive.We provide a case study in , where no mat-ter what the user query is, the model will trigger thedefense mechanism, adding the few-shot exampleto the input. The experiment is conducted on theBS-NC dataset, where the text is not copyrighted.As shown in the table, the model with this settinghas a high refusal rate, indicating that the model isoverprotective. This validates that the models them-selves cannot distinguish between copyrighted andnon-copyrighted text when the prompt explicitlystates that the text is copyrighted, which validatesthe need for the copyright status verifier.",
  "F.7Case study: Another example ofhallucination": "We provide another case study of the defense mech-anism against Prefix Probing in . Thefigure shows when using the Prefix Probing, themodel with Defense Mechanisms shows similarbehavior with . The model with Mem-Free decoding generates less copied text than theoriginal model, but it suffers from hallucination.On the contrary, the model with our Agent-baseddefense mechanism refuses to generate the copy-righted text, which is the desired behavior. Asshown in the table, SHIELD significantly reducesthe LCS and ROUGE-L scores, while maintaininga high refusal rate. This indicates that SHIELD iseffective in mitigating the jailbreak attack probing.",

In the United States, textmaterials published before January 1, 1924, are inthe public domain (Stim, 2013), so they are avail-able for anyone to use, modify, distribute, or buildupon without needing permission or paying royal-ties to the original creator. For text materials pub-lished from 1924 onwards, copyright duration canvary based on whether copyrights were renewed,with many works published between 1924 and 1977being protected for 95 years if properly renewed.Text materials published after 1977 generally enjoyprotection for the life of the author plus 70 years,though different durations apply for works for hireand anonymous or pseudonymous works (Office,2023). Internationally, many countries adhere tothe Berne Convention (World Intellectual PropertyOrganization (WIPO), 1971), which standardizescopyright protection to a degree, often extendingit to life plus 70 years, although some countrieshave different durations such as life plus 50 or 100years (Organization, 2016). Special considerationsalso apply to new editions, translations, and deriva-tive works, which may have separate copyrights.Its also worth noting that there are unique casesthat further complicate matters, such as the copy-right for Peter Pan\" by J.M. Barrie, which hasbeen extended indefinitely in the UK by the govern-ment as a special provision (Great Ormond StreetHospital, 2021).Databases and resources Accurately determininga books copyright status often requires consult-ing national records and international databases.The US Copyright Office provides a searchabledatabase of copyright records, offering informa- tion on registrations and renewals for works pub-lished in the United States since 1978 (Office,2023). Materials published in the United Statescan be checked against the Stanford Copyright Re-newal Database, which contains records of copy-right renewals for books published between 1923and 1963 (University, 2023). The HathiTrust Digi-tal Library (HathiTrust, 2008), Internet Archive (In-ternet Archive, 1996), LibriVox (LibriVox, 2005),Open Library (Open Library, 2006), and Many-Books (ManyBooks, 2004) are valuable resourcesfor accessing digitized books, audiobooks, andeBooks, with many public domain works avail-able for free. Google Books (Google Books, 2004)offers a vast collection of books for preview andpurchase, with many public domain works avail-able for free and advanced search and organizationfeatures. Stanford University Libraries provide adataset of copyright renewal records for books pub-lished between 1923 and 1963 (University, 2023),due to the renewal requirement for works publishedin the United States during that period. We providea list of copyright office homepages for differentcountries in the Appendix G.2, to help users checkthe copyright status of text materials. These publicresources may be complicated for users to navigate,and consulting a legal professional for specific ad-vice may be necessary. Our work aims to providea user-friendly dataset to evaluate LLMs perfor-mance in handling copyrighted text. Although notcomprehensive, our dataset is manually evaluatedto accurately reflect the copyright status and canhelp users understand the challenges of text copy-right.
