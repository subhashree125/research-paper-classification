  "Abstract": "Recent improvements in natural language pro-cessing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) andincreased mainstream adoption have led to re-searchers frequently discussing the democrati-zation of artificial intelligence. In this paper,we seek to clarify how democratization is un-derstood in NLP and ML publications, throughlarge-scale mixed-methods analyses of papersusing the keyword democra* published inNLP and adjacent venues. We find that de-mocratization is most frequently used to con-vey (ease of) access to or use of technologies,without meaningfully engaging with theories ofdemocratization, while research using other in-vocations of democra* tends to be groundedin theories of deliberation and debate. Basedon our findings, we call for researchers to en-rich their use of the term democratization withappropriate theory, towards democratic tech-nologies beyond superficial access.1",
  "Introduction": "As the influence of language technologies hasgrown, it has become increasingly popular to dis-cuss democratization in natural language pro-cessing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) re-search (Seger et al., 2023); for instance, OpenAIhas invested in a democratic process for decidingwhat rules AI systems should follow (Zarembaet al., 2023), Anthropic has explored how demo-cratic processes can influence artificial intelligence(AI) development (Ganguli et al., 2023), and Hug-gingFace has stated their mission to be to de-mocratize good machine learning (Simon, 2022).Indeed, a large number of NLP and ML papersmention terms related to democracy (see ),thereby raising the question: What do we under-stand by democracy and democratization whenwe invoke them in research?",
  ": Frequency of mentions of democracy (>0)per paper in all work published in the ACL Anthology,ICLR, ICML, or NeurIPS before November 24, 2023.76.1% of papers only mention democracy once": "So far, the treatment of democracy in NLP andML literature, and particularly the term democ-ratization, has not been subject to careful investi-gation. Our paper fills this gap by analyzing usesof democratization in NLP and ML papers, andtheir connections to democracy. We examine con-ceptualizations of these terms through a large-scalemixed-methods analysis of every use of democra*in papers published in the Anthology of the Asso-ciation of Computational Linguistics (ACL Anthol-ogy), the International Conference on LearningRepresentations (ICLR), the International Confer-ence on Machine Learning (ICML), and NeuralInformation Processing Systems (NeurIPS).We find that on one hand, the use of democra-tization tends to indicate a broadening of accessto research artifacts, particularly without domainexpertise, while NLP and ML literature discussingdemocracy in other contexts is often rooted in the-ories of deliberation and debate. We also find thatwhile authors associate democratization with pos-itive values related to access and reducing costs,the term itself is rarely defined or operationalized. Prior work has argued that the democratization ofAI revolves primarily around the notion of access(Burkhardt, 2019; Sudmann, 2019; Sudmann andWaibel, 2019; Luchs, 2023); our work provides sys-tematic evidence for this claim, and is grounded ina comparison to other democracy-related terms.Next, we examine papers that mention democ-racy for their depth of engagement with the topic,by exploring their text and citations. We find thata majority of papers only invoke democracy once,do so outside of methods and results sections, andengage minimally with extra-disciplinary work.We conclude that democratization constitutesa misnomer for access, and therefore encouragefuture work to either enrich their research by draw-ing on over 3000 years of scholarship on democ-racy and democratization, or use access instead.Lacking clear, consistent and responsible use of theterm democratization, NLP and ML risk misrep-resenting progress in capturing democratic values,the distribution of power, and public control ofAI. Clearer conceptualizations of democratizationcan thus strengthen progress towards truly demo-cratic technologies beyond just superficial access.",
  "Democratization beyond AI": "The use of democratization extends far beyondAI. In conservation biology, for instance, it is dis-cussed in the context of citizen and communityscience; public participation in processes such asdata collection is seen as democratizing knowledgeproduction (Bela et al., 2016), and reducing gapsbetween academia and wider society (Sauermannet al., 2020). However, constraining communityscience to participation has also been criticized asparticipation washing (Sloane et al., 2022), asit often disregards local knowledge, prevents thepublic from formulating scientific questions, andfails to change the norms of institutions (Kimuraand Kinchy, 2016). In contrast, political scientistsexamine the democratization of policy researchthrough collaborative citizen-expert inquiry (Fis-cher, 1993) which has been considered essentialto democratically tackling social issues (Weinberg,2022). Internet scholars investigate the democratiz-ing effects of online information and social media,i.e., how they have helped to spread pro-democraticideas, discussions, and protests globally (Hill andHughes, 1999; Weinstein, 2012). Beyond research,there have been calls towards protecting the in- tegrity of democracy through the democratizationof media and free access to pluralistic informa-tion and opinion (de Zayas, 2017). In relationto emerging democracies, the democratization ofmedia is often linked to the diversification of newssources (Barnett, 1999; Tettey, 2001; Porto, 2012).",
  "Conceptions of democratization in AI": "Research in AI has presented access-centric con-ceptions of democratization, e.g., to identify crite-ria for democratizing the use of AI, such as afford-ability, accessibility, and fairness (Ahmed et al.,2020). Similarly, Ahmed and Wahed (2020) con-ceptualize democratization as equity in access tocompute between tech companies and non-eliteuniversities. However, this line of research has notexamined the possible connections between democ-ratization and democracy. Prior work has also chal-lenged the conceptualization of democratization inAI. Seger et al. (2023) argue that disparate usesof the term democratization have caused a lackof recognition of shared goals, methodologies,risks, and benefits. Drawing from news articlesand talks, they identify four notions of democrati-zation: use, development, benefits, and governance.Similarly, in a study of 35 articles on the use ofdemocratization and its connection to democracywithin the scope of medical AI, Rubeis et al. (2022)uncover diverse conceptualizations, from increas-ing data access to AI governance.Another line of work, focusing on AI governanceand increased public control of AI developmentand deployment, argues that public participation iscritical for democratizing AI, e.g., Gilman (2023)calls for institutions to budget for participation atall stages of AI development. Participation has alsobeen operationalized by aligning models to a con-stitution based on the values of human representa-tives (Siddarth, 2023); by connecting open-sourceand democratic communities, and widening geo-graphic diversity in public input processes (Collec-tive Intelligence Project, 2024); and by leveragingdemocratic frameworks to gather AI uses, harms,and benefits from the public to guide the evaluationand regulation of AI (Mun et al., 2024). However,these approaches offer minimal opportunities forpublics to contest the logics and power structuresof the AI industry (Luchs, 2023).In contrast to these bodies of work, we perform alarge-scale mixed-methods analysis of papers pub-lished at NLP and ML venues. Similarly to Seger et al. (2023) and Rubeis et al. (2022), we find dis-tinct conceptualizations of democratization that ob-viate its benefits and risks, often due to a lack oftheoretical engagement. Ultimately, our analysisshows that the dominant conception of democrati-zation is access, and that a shared understanding ofdemocratization and democracy, which is essentialfor democratic frameworks, remains absent withinthe NLP and ML community at large.",
  "Data": "Using the Semantic Scholar API (Kinney et al.,2023), we collect all papers published beforeNovember 24, 2023 in the ACL Anthology, ICML,ICLR, and NeurIPS, that mention terms relatedto democracy. We choose these venues, as theyare top-tier NLP and ML conferences that influ-ence practices in the field. We obtain 1,537 pa-pers, which we filter for relevance, obtaining a finaldataset of 506 papers and 916 excerpts for analysis. Obtaining ExcerptsWe first collect all metadataand text from open-access PDFs using the Seman-tic Scholar API. We split the text of each paper us-ing the punkt NLTK sentence tokenizer (Bird andLoper, 2004), and extract all sentences that containthe substring democra (excluding democrats),resulting in 4,203 excerpts across 1,709 papers. Wedo not include related terms (e.g., participatorygovernance, constitution, etc.) so that we do notinadvertently select irrelevant papers, and to keepour discussion firmly grounded in a comparisonbetween democratization and democracy. Filtering Irrelevant ExcerptsIn order to iden-tify excerpts that reveal how authors conceptual-ize democratization and democracy, we re-move unrelated uses of democra, such as those innamed entities (e.g., Center for Media and Democ-racy), motivating examples (e.g., for textual en-tailment), modeling examples (e.g., LDA topics),examples from datasets (e.g., tweets), mentionsin non-English languages, and references. We per-form this filtering using a two-stage approach: auto-matic filtering and manual annotation for relevance.We curate a list of terms (see Appendix A) forautomatically filtering excerpts: We exclude namedentities (e.g., the Syrian Democratic Forces) andterms that exclusively appear as examples of data(e.g., tweets containing #democracy). One authorverified all automatically filtered excerpts.After filtering, we manually annotate the re- maining 2,273 excerpts, searching for instanceswhere the authors deliberately use words contain-ing democra as part of their argument or evi-dence, examining the full PDF in ambiguous cases.After concluding the two-stage filtering process, weobtain 916 excerpts from 506 papers for analysis.",
  "Methodology": "Two authors annotate the first 300 excerpts inde-pendently for themes, concepts, and values in anopen-ended manner (see for example ex-cerpts and annotations). We then resolve incon-sistencies and consolidate themes, concepts, andvalues, before annotating the remaining excerptsindependently. Finally, we group the themes, con-cepts, and values, respectively, into sets per paper. ThemesWe qualitatively code the excerpts toidentify salient, overarching themes that character-ize how they discuss democracy; this is a commoninductive methodology from the social sciences de-scribed by Saldana (2021). Four major categoriesemerge after a first pass over all the excerpts:",
  "Math: mathematical or ML ways to operational-ize democracy (e.g., democratic matrices, mathe-matical models of democracy)": "Two authors then systematically annotate everyexcerpt with an explicit and, if applicable, an im-plicit theme. An explicit theme is assigned to ex-cerpts that explicitly state, e.g., that something isnecessary for or a danger to democracy; otherwise,it is classified as other. In contrast, the implicittheme requires annotators to make inferences abouthow researchers think about democracy.",
  ": Example excerpts each of the four themes, along with the associated concepts we annotate": "For example, the excerpt: The most democraticoption is to give each tagger one vote (Majority), isassigned an explicit theme of math, as it discussesoperationalizing NLP taggers in a democraticway. We also infer that the authors believe majorityvoting is necessary for democracy, hence neces-sary/beneficial is assigned as an implicit theme.We do not differentiate between papers aboutthe effect of democracy on technology (e.g., dan-ger) and democratic principles in technology(e.g., democratization), as all papers that invokedemocracy-related terms can engage with demo-cratic theories, and both themes relate to participa-tion. Not distinguishing between them and insteadinductively looking for what patterns emerge al-lows us to identify how differently democratizationand democracy may be conceptualized. Values and ConceptsThe same two authors alsolabel each excerpt for values (e.g., consensus andequality) and more broadly concepts (e.g., misin-formation and elections) associated with democ-racy to explore conceptualizations of democracymore granularly. We focus on values (a subset ofconcepts) in our main analysis; see Appendix B forfurther discussion of values and concepts.",
  "Results": "Where and How Often is Democracy Invoked?We find that the vast majority of papers that men-tion the democra* tokens only mention it once(see ), and most mentions occur in the ab-stract, introduction, and conclusion sections (see). These results support our findings in.2 that democracy is under-discussed inNLP and ML literature. Additionally, we find viaa close reading of the nine papers with seven ormore mentions that a larger number of mentionsdoes not necessarily signal higher engagement; forexample, mathematical papers frequently refer todemocratic mathematical objects without connect-ing them to democratic theories.",
  "cation setting (McHugh, 2012), with 110 possibleconcepts, there is a much lower random chanceof agreement, and thus 0.349 reflects moderate tohigh agreement in this context": "Values Associated with Democracy in NLP andML shows the values associated withdemocratization compared to all other mentionsof democracy. We find that some values contra-dict each other. For instance, work has conceptual-ized random selection, consensus, and major-ity (voting) as democratic, however these are allmutually exclusive of one another. Yet, researchersconceptualize NLP and ML systems operating inthese three manners as democratic, showing theneed to explicitly consider how different systemsrequire different conceptualizations of democracy.We find that non-democratization papers iden-tify values and concepts that readily connect towidespread theoretical notions of democracy, e.g.,decision-making, deliberation, debate, and diver-sity. In contrast, democratization papers are over-whelmingly associated with increasing access, easeof use, and reducing costs and barriers. That is,democratization papers share values with radicalegalitarian theories of democracy (see ),but do not distinguish or make apparent the relation-ship between access and equal access to democraticprocesses. Thus, in contrast to other fields (see Sec-tion 2.1), NLP and ML researchers who use thesewords seem to conceive of democratization quitedifferently from democracy, associating them withdifferent and sometimes conflicting values, andagreeing primarily that both are aspirational.",
  "Methods": "We measure the depth of engagement with democ-racy by counting where and how often democra*terms are mentioned in papers. We extract sectionnames using the Semantic Scholar API and nor-malize them across papers, e.g., mapping RelatedWorks to Related Work. For a complementaryview of engagement that is not limited to wordscontaining the substring democra, we also studythe references these papers cite: the fields theybelong to, the proportion of extra-disciplinary cita-tions, and citational intent, i.e., whether the citationis used to provide background, inform the method-ology of the paper, or is related to the results. Thisanalysis allows us to evaluate engagement with the-ories of democracy. We obtain field, venue andintent metadata using the Semantic Scholar API;we classify references as intra-disciplinary if theyare from Computer Science, Mathematics, or Lin- Number of democratization mentions broader impact figure related work ethics conclusion introduction abstract",
  "Engagement with Democratic Theories": "Given such a lack of consideration within the de-mocratization theme, we examine how NLP andML papers engage with literature on democracy tounderstand its influence on the conceptualizationsin . We argue that discussing democracyor democratization without connecting to estab-lished theories reflects subpar interdisciplinarityand citational praxis, and risks misrepresentinghow grounded AI is in democratic values.",
  ": Top causes, targets and goals of democratization in the 213 papers that mention it": "CausesNone specified (59%), compute re-duction, data, cost reduction, so-cial media, time reduction, opensource, internet, access, tools, re-search, model hubs, librariesTargetsResearch, access, NLP, AI, ML, con-tent creation, DL, language models,MT, internet, information, RL, dataGoalsNone specified (75%), use withoutexpertise, access, increased languageuse, social good, reduce barriers,multilingual, sociological phenom-ena, quality issues, broader audience,fake news, commodification",
  ": Proportion of fields of study of referencescited by papers that mention democracy": "is cited three times more than the second most fre-quent field, linguistics (12.9%) (see ). Fol-lowing these, mathematics (9.7%), political science(5.8%), and sociology (4.1%) are most prominentlycited. Given the direct relationship between ML,computer science and mathematics, and NLP andlinguistics, less than 29% of references are directedtowards other disciplines. This number may notindicate low engagement in and of itself, as it rep-resents an aggregated view of our entire corpus ofpapers. However, when we look at individual pa-pers, we find that the majority of them cite zeroor one extra-disciplinary works: 181 papers citezero extra-disciplinary papers, and another 88 citeexactly one. Given the invocation of far-reachingsocial concepts such as democracy and democra-tization, such poor levels of engagement are par-ticularly surprising. The remaining 220 papersconstitute a long-tail that engages more extensivelywith literature outside of NLP and ML.Analyzing the extra-disciplinary citations, wesee that most citations are from the social sciences,especially political science. However, when con-sidering citational intent, we find that most (82.3%)are cited as background, and 15.5% and 2.14% arein the context of methods and results, respectively.Thus, even when work on democracy and democ-ratization consults extra-disciplinary research, itmay be primarily used to frame work rather thanengage with methods or analyses of results. Sim-ply citing scholarship on democracy (e.g., hit andrun citations; Gorelik (2019)) is not equivalent tomeaningfully engaging with it. To evaluate our useof extra-disciplinary citational intent as a proxy formeaningful engagement with democratic theories,we closely read the 15 papers with background,methods, and results citations of extra-disciplinarywork. We observe that only the papers citing politi-cal science and economics literature, in particular,for methods and results, exhibit deeper considera- tion of theories of democracy and democratization.Among citations of political science and economicsreferences, most are still background (84.4%), with13.5% and 2.15% in the context of methods andresults. We confirm that the nine papers with back-ground, methods, and results citations of politicalscience and economics literature indeed meaning-fully engage with democracy and democratization.",
  "Below, we present some examples of papers withhigher engagement with democratic theories:": "Public Dialogue: Analysis of Tolerance in On-line DiscussionsMukherjee et al. (2013) dis-cusses tolerance in online discussion, citing workon public spheres, deliberative democracy, toler-ance, public dialogue, deliberation, disagreement,and consensus. The authors ground their method-ology in this cited work and perform a compu-tational study of tolerance in online discussions.They also interpret their results in the context ofthis literature, discussing consequences for deliber-ative discussion and society at large when sustaineddisagreement turns into intolerance. A Mathematical Model For Optimal Deci-sions In A Representative DemocracyMagdon-Ismail and Xia (2018) propose a mathematicalmodel for decision-making under representativedemocracy. Their extra-disciplinary citations in-clude social sciences and mathematical social sci-ences. Through discussion of the differences be-tween direct democracy and representative democ-racy, the authors motivate a new mathematicalmodel to study the quality-quantity tradeoff withdifferent numbers of representatives, for differenttypes of voting issues, and with different levels ofpublic competence. Asking Too Much? The Rhetorical Role of Ques-tions in Political DiscourseZhang et al. (2017)identify a rich source of rhetorical information inquestions in UK parliamentary debates, and thusanalyze these as an example of the rhetorical as-pects of question in political discourse. They citeextra-disciplinary literature that establishes the roleof questions in democratic processes, and moti-vate their work as a quantitative examination ofaspects that have mostly been qualitatively exam-ined before. Their unsupervised approach discov-ers clusters of question types asked in parliamen-tary discussions. The authors present an analysis of these clusters and the members of parliamentposing these questions (in terms of their tenure andtheir affiliation to the governing party or the opposi-tion), grounded within extra-disciplinary literatureabout UK politics and history. Legal and Political Stance Detection of SCO-TUS LanguageBergam et al. (2022) studies theSupreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) us-ing text analysis and stance detection on publiclyavailable documents. Grounding their motivationand analysis in literature about public opinion anddemocratic principles, the authors also comparetheir approach to existing metrics from the socialsciences, and show how a result about case salienceparallels existing findings in political science re-search. Finally, they note a trade-off common tothe quantitative social sciences in their ethics state-ment, i.e., that quantitatively analyzing text at scaleerases many aspects of its complexity, even as ithelps to uncover patterns that cannot feasibly beuncovered by a single qualitative researcher.",
  "Democratic Theories and NLP and ML": "As democratization has had a long history of studystarting from 1100 BCE in ancient Phoenicia (Ja-cobsen, 1943; Glassman, 2017; Graeber and Wen-grow, 2021), in this section, we consider selecttheories of democracy as a basis for how NLP andML research has understood and operationalizeddemocracy. We argue that these theories can pro-vide foundations for more democratic NLP and MLtechnologies by making democratic discussionsrepresentative and efficient, diversifying forumsfor democratic dialogues, and dismantling barriersto participation in democratic processes. Deliberative DemocraciesDeliberation and in-clusion in the democratic process are often high-lighted as goals for democratic societies (Roberts,2004) and technologies (Gilman, 2023). Indeed,in our surveyed papers, democratic deliberation of-ten appears as a goal (see ). Deliberativedemocracy is a form of democracy that emphasizesprocesses where participants can debate a particu-lar object (e.g., a policy or technology) on its meritsand make collective decisions about its implemen-tation (Goodin, 2000). Deliberative democratictheory thus provides an avenue for obtaining morelegitimacy of decisions by engaging wider publicsin conversation about the use and application ofresearch artifacts (Rosenberg, 2007). Democratic SpheresAs diversity and equal rep-resentation are values often associated with democ-racy in NLP and ML, this raises the question ofhow we might achieve such goals. While delib-erative democracy provides an avenue for engag-ing publics, creating a single democratic arenaorsphere, as argued for by Habermas (1991)for alarge and diverse group gives weight to the loudestvoices and majoritarian perspectives. This risksrelegating many communities to the margins, par-ticularly when the publics are large. In contrast, aplurality of public spheres, which each representsmaller communities, can afford better represen-tation of all communities (Fraser, 1990). In prac-tice, if NLP and ML research is consulting a largergroup, it can be useful to divide the group intosmaller segments, for all voices to be heard. Democracy and PowerMumford (1964) hasargued that technology can either afford access,agency, and distribute power, i.e., be democratic,or consolidate power within a small set of actors,i.e., be authoritarian. Therefore, efforts towardsoperationalizing the democratization of NLP andML need to understand and address barriers to pub-lic participation and uneven distributions of power.In relation to discriminatory ML, Kalluri (2020)and DIgnazio and Klein (2020) have argued thatsearching for fair ML can serve as a distraction toconsidering how ML distributes power. Radical Egalitarian DemocraciesOne ap-proach towards dismantling power differentials andbarriers to participation is egalitarian democratictheory. Under this framework, all humans musthave equal access to participate in democratic pro-cesses, and these processes should in turn insti-tute programs that dismantle systems of oppres-sion (Wright, 2010). However, the development,operation, and control of NLP and ML technolo-gies are currently determined by the interests ofprivately held companies (Zaremba et al., 2023;Ganguli et al., 2023; Talat et al., 2022; Gray Widderet al., 2023), under processes that consolidate im-pact within a small segment of society. Addressingbarriers to public participation and power differen-tials, as seen through egalitarian democratic theory,would require rethinking processes of public en-gagement in all stages of the development lifecycle.",
  "Discussion, Conclusion, andRecommendations": "Our thematic and large-scale mixed-methods anal-yses show that democracy is used in NLP and MLwith infrequent operationalization of democrati-zation, vastly different views of what democracymeans, and low levels of interdisciplinary engage-ment. Overall, our results show that when invokingdemocracy, NLP and ML researchers only shal-lowly engage with the centuries of literature fromphilosophy and social science devoted to it. It isthus necessary that NLP and ML researchers de-scribe what they mean by and how they intendto operationalize democratization, to avoid mis-representing public control of AI and bolsteringutopian-idealistic AI hype (Sudmann, 2019).In particular, researchers should reflect on whatvalues and concepts they associate with democrati-zation, how their understanding of democratizationmay be contested, and how their usage of democ-ratization may be overloaded or overhyped. Wealso echo Seger et al.s (2023) call to simply usethe word access rather than normatively loadedlanguage like democratization when discussingaccess-related questions. Researchers should gobeyond access as the sole condition for partic-ipation (Luchs, 2023) and discuss the processesfor democratic oversight and control of their arti-facts (Verdegem, 2022). To this end, they shouldexplicate the causes, targets, methods, and goals ofdemocratization, what it means for their research tobe fully democratic, and which opportunities andlimits to public participation and control emerge.Moreover, when invoking democracy and relatedconcepts, researchers should detail how their un-derstanding is informed by underlying theory andensure to draw from and cite relevant literature.Conversely, if it is not, they should explicitly indi-cate this in their work. In both cases, researchersshould reflect on where their conceptualizationsfail with respect to their research and goals, andwhich challenges remain unresolved by their work.For example, when invoking democratization, re-searchers should explicitly note what remains unre-solved in their goal of democratized technologies.Some efforts, e.g., OpenAIs call for democraticinputs to AI (Zaremba et al., 2023) and AnthropicAIs Collective Intelligence Project (2024), appearto engage more deeply with definitions and im-plications of democratic AI, yet do not criticallyexamine questions of power and control. Similarly, Djeffal (2019) operationalizes AI democratizationin line with democratic traditions, including parlia-mentary processes to debate and regulate artificialintelligence. However, on the whole, we musturgently reflect on [our] engagement with otherfields (Wahle et al., 2023). While engagementwith democratic theory is a necessary precondi-tion for research towards democratizing NLP andML technologies, it is also necessary to addressthe hegemonic praxis of NLP and ML, and how itbegets or hinders democratic technologies.",
  "Limitations": "In our analysis, we may miss relevant NLP and MLliterature that treats democratization or democracydue to our focus on the ACL Anthology, ICLR,ICML and NeurIPS. In our choice of these venues,we are not explicitly controlling for differences inprestige (e.g., workshop papers in the ACL anthol-ogy, c.f. main conference papers) or focus (mostnotably, NLP versus ML), an analysis of which weleave to future work. We further cannot accountfor the perspectives of NLP and ML researcherswho have richer conceptualizations of democrati-zation but are not writing about it. In addition,our filtering of excerpts based on keywords likedemocra may cause us to exclude important dis-cussions of democracy-adjacent concepts that donot use the word. This may be worsened by parsingerrors stemming from our methods and the Seman-tic Scholar API. The Semantic Scholar API canalso fail to correctly predict scholarly metadata, in-cluding fields of study and intent, which may affectour results. Furthermore, our discussion of theoriesof democracy (see ) is far from exhaustive,given the rich history of the subject.",
