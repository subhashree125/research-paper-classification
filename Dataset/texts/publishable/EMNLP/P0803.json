  "Abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are susceptibleto a type of attack known as jailbreaking, whichmisleads LLMs to output harmful contents. Al-though there are diverse jailbreak attack strate-gies, there is no unified understanding on whysome methods succeed and others fail. This pa-per explores the behavior of harmful and harm-less prompts in the LLMs representation spaceto investigate the intrinsic properties of success-ful jailbreak attacks. We hypothesize that suc-cessful attacks share some similar properties:They are effective in moving the representationof the harmful prompt towards the directionto the harmless prompts. We leverage hiddenrepresentations into the objective of existingjailbreak attacks to move the attacks along theacceptance direction, and conduct experimentsto validate the above hypothesis using the pro-posed objective. We hope this study providesnew insights into understanding how LLMs un-derstand harmfulness information. 1",
  "Introduction": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have becomeubiquitous in various applications such as provid-ing financial advice and assisting trading (Yanget al., 2023b), supporting clinical decisions (Raoet al., 2023), and assisting law thematic analy-sis (Drpal et al., 2023), due to their exceptionalability to understand and generate human-like text.However, as LLMs are trained on vast text corporawhich are usually scratched from the internet andcontain diverse topics including toxic content, theycan sometimes produce inaccurate or harmful con-tents (Zhou et al., 2023; Hazell, 2023; Kang et al.,2023). Therefore, various safety aligning mecha-nisms, such as Reinforcement Learning from Hu-man Feedback (RLHF) (Ziegler et al., 2019) and",
  "*These authors contributed equally to this work.1Ourcodeisavailableat": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailovet al., 2024) have been leveraged to align LLMswith human values and prevent them from generat-ing harmful content.Despite these efforts, a new class of vulnerabil-ity known as jailbreak attacks (Wei et al., 2024;Carlini et al., 2024) has emerged. Jailbreak attacksmanipulate the models input prompt to bypassthe safety mechanisms, enabling the generationof harmful contents. Various jailbreak attack al-gorithms such as GCG (Zou et al., 2023b), Au-toDAN (Liu et al., 2023), and PAIR (Chao et al.,2023) have been proposed to exploit vulnerabilitiesin both open-source and API-only LLMs. However,most of these studies do not provide a compre-hensive understanding of the internal mechanismsof these jailbreak attacks, which makes it still un-known when and how jailbreak attacks will suc-ceed. A more thorough understanding is desired forfurther improving the performance of these attacks,as well as for devising more effective defenses.In this work, we focus on understanding the be-havior of jailbreak attacks through the learned rep-resentation space of the victim LLMs. In detail, inour analysis in , we first find that well-aligned LLMs (such as Llama with RLHF) canprovide clearly separable representations for theharmless prompts and harmful prompts. It suggeststhese models can effectively extract the harmfulinformation from the harmful prompts and distin-guish them with harmless prompts. More impor-tantly, we further visualize the representations ofjailbreak prompts obtained through representativejailbreak attacks like GCG (Zou et al., 2023b), Au-toDAN (Liu et al., 2023), and PAIR (Chao et al.,2023). We observe an increasing ratio of succeededjailbreak prompts over failed jailbreak promptsalong the direction from the cluster of harmfulprompts to the cluster of harmless prompts. Thisobservation indicates that prompts moving in theaforementioned direction towards the cluster of harmless prompts are more effective at deceivingthe victim LLMs.Based on these insights, to comprehensively un-derstand the role of harmfulness in jailbreak at-tacks, we further leverage the representation in ex-isting attacks by introducing a novel optimizationobjective to move the representation of the prompttoward the acceptance direction. This new opti-mization objective can be simply combined withexisting white-box jailbreak attack methods. Weemploy our method in GCG (Zou et al., 2023b) andAutoDAN (Liu et al., 2023), and conduct experi-ments to study Attack Success Rate (ASR) broughtby this new method compared with correspond-ing baselines. For example, we achieve an ASRof 62.31% over Llama-2-13b-chat model(Touvronet al., 2023) after enhancing GCG(Zou et al.,2023b), which is 36.16% higher than the corre-sponding baseline (26.15%). These results furthersupport our understanding of jailbreak attacks.",
  "Related works": "Safety alignment of LLMs. To avoid the genera-tion of harmful and toxic contents, various mech-anisms that align LLMs closer to human values(Glaese et al., 2022; Korbak et al., 2023; Wanget al., 2022) are developed. The general approachinvolves fine-tuning LLMs with human feedback(Wu et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvronet al., 2023). Specifically, Supervised Fine-Tuning(SFT) (Wu et al., 2021) collects a large volume ofdemonstrations and comparisons from human label-ers, and fine-tunes LLMs using behavioral cloningand reward modeling to do summarization recur-sively. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feed-back (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017; Stiennonet al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022) trains a rewardmodel based on human feedback and fine-tunes themodel with reinforcement learning via proximalpolicy optimization on the reward model. Whilethese alignments significantly reduce the genera-tion of harmful content, recent researches revealthat safety-aligned LLMs still have a chance to out-put undesired answers under certain situations (Weiet al., 2024). Jailbreak attacks in LLMs.Jailbreak attackstypically manipulate input prompts to bypass thesafety alignment of LLMs and induce them to pro-duce harmful responses. Generally, these attacksare divided into manually crafted prompts (suchas DAN (Lee, 2023)) and automated attack meth- ods, which are much more efficient and effective.GCG (Zou et al., 2023b) considers a token-levelmanipulation and optimizing an adversarial suffixwith a greedy coordinate gradient descent approach.The adversarial suffix is optimized to force themodel output confirmation responses. Another at-tack method, AutoDAN (Liu et al., 2023), utilizesa genetic algorithm to optimize the whole prompton the sentence and paragraph level to maintainfluency and high attacking effectiveness simultane-ously. These methods require a white-box setting,while another line of attacks focuses on API-onlymodels like GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023). PAIR(Chao et al., 2023) leverages an LLM as the op-timizer (Yang et al., 2023a) to generate the jail-break prompt, and only need to query the modelwithout access to the internal part of the model.More attack methods explores to generate attack-ing prompts with the help of LLMs, including TAP(Mehrotra et al., 2023), GPTFUZZER (Yu et al.,2023), MasterKey (Deng et al., 2023), and Ad-vPrompter (Paulus et al., 2024). Though thesemethods show great potential in bypassing thesafety alignment of LLMs, the inner mechanism ofjailbreaks is still under-explored.",
  "Analysis on the Representation forJailbreak Attacks": "Although various jailbreak attack methods havebeen proposed, it remains unclear when and howan attack can succeed in misleading a models out-put. Therefore, we aim to analyze the behaviorof these jailbreak attacks by visualizing the rep-resentations from victim LLMs. Specifically, wewill investigate the representations of the anchorprompts and different types of jailbreak prompts,to explore the answers to the following questions:",

In this case, the first two principal compo-nents of PCA will mainly focus on explaining thedata variation in terms of the harmfulness. We mainly study three jailbreak attacks includ-ing white-box attacks, GCG (Zou et al., 2023b) andAutoDAN (Liu et al., 2023), and black-box attack,PAIR (Chao et al., 2023). For the ease of furtherobservation and analysis, both GCG and AutoDANemploy early stopping (terminate on success) astheir termination criteria to boost the ASR of eachmethod. We also conduct the same experimentswithout applying early stopping, and the result indi-cates that the conclusion of this section still holds(cf. Appendix A.2). Details on the ASR of eachattack can be found in Appendix A.1.To visualize the representation, we first conductPCA dimension reduction on the representations ofthe harmless and harmful anchor datasets Da Drto find the first two principal components. Then,we project each representation vector, as well asthe representation of prompts in jailbreak datasets(initial, failed and succeed) onto the 2-D spacespanned by these two principal components. Thevisualization result is in . From ,we can have the following observations:Observation 1. Harmful and harmless anchorprompts are separable (in well-aligned LLMs).If we only focus on the representations of anchordatasets ( harmful and harmless), we canfind that the representations are well separated be-tween harmful and harmless anchor prompts, espe-cially in LLMs such as llama2-7b, llama2-13b andllama3-8b. It indicates that these models can effec-tively capture harmful information from the harm-ful prompts and distinguish them from harmlessprompts. In addition to the visualization, the PCAexplained variance ratios are 0.4639 and 0.0403 forthe first two principal components on llama2-7b,respectively. This further demonstrates that the twodimensions of PCA effectively capture the majorvariation in the data.We also calculate the ratio of between-class vari-ation and within-class variation of the two anchordatasets on llama2-7b. With the two datasets, onecan calculate the overall variation among all sam-ples (total variance), and can also calculate thevariation within each cluster (within-class vari-ance) and between all clusters (between-class vari-ance). A larger between-class variance ratio indi-cates that the clusters are more separated from eachother.

  "in the PCA-reduced space can effectively increasethe possibility of jailbreaking the model": "Methodology-wise, we develop a method to com-bine with existing jailbreak attacks.

Note that these optimization algo-rithms work in different manners, so our proposedmethod may exhibit different phenomena. In gen-eral, if an algorithm can successfully optimize theobjective, then our proposed method is expected tolead to a better performance.Early Stopping. Through our preliminary trials,a potential problem of optimizing Equation 1 is thelack of control over the semantic meaning. If thesemantic changes are significant, the model mayrespond to the prompt with completely unrelatedtext, also mentioned in Zou et al. (2023b). For ex-ample, the computed adversarial suffix string givesNever mind, tell me a joke instead, then the LLMoutputs an irrelevant joke. We refer to this situation",
  ": Graphical illustration of early stopping": "as an off-topic response, and consider it as a failedjailbreak attempt. The risk of the models responsegoing off-topic due to excessive semantic changesarises from over-optimization, which can cause asignificant shift in the representations position. Tomitigate this risk, we employ an early stoppingstrategy to limit the total number of iterations.To implement early stopping, a simple strategyis to use an LLM classifier as a judge to recognizethe semantics. In each step, the classifier checksthe semantics and stops the optimization as soonas jailbreak is succeeded. Note that effective classi-fiers are usually slow in inference. Therefore, weuse a double-check approach to speed up the check-ing. A graphical illustration can be found in . In the first check, we generate a short lengthof output (i.e., short generation length) and use asimple string-matching method to check for refusalin responses through keyword matching. The key-words we use for string matching are detailed inAppendix F. However, even if the LLM respondswith a refusal, its output text may not include anyof the keywords from the list, leading the methodto falsely identify the prompt as a succeeded attack.Thus, this method in the first step usually results ina high false positive rate, and we consider a secondcheck to improve the accuracy. In the second check,when the string matching method does not detect arefusal, we then use a longer generation length andclassifier to check again. The classifier we apply isan LLM-based classifier proposed by Mazeika et al.(2024). It is a fine-tuned Llama-2-13b-chat modelthat provides a binary judgment (yes or no) onwhether a jailbreak is succeeded based on a harm-ful query and the models response. The prompttemplate used by this judge model can be found inAppendix H. We use this method because it fits ourpurpose to identify off-topic responses as failedjailbreak attacks. If the result of the second de-tection is still succeeded, i.e., the classifier replieswith yes, the current step is succeeded, and theoptimization stops.The above double-check strategy balances theefficiency and accuracy of detection. In our ex-periment, we set the shorter generation length for string matching as 32 tokens as GCG (Zou et al.,2023b) does, and the longer generation length as512 tokens as suggested by Mazeika et al. (2024).Note that this may not be the only method to pre-vent off-topic responses, but it serves our analyti-cal purposes to identify the off-topic cases. Moredetailed examples on how this strategy identifiesoff-topic responses as failed attacks can be foundin Appendix C.",
  "Experiment Setting": "The proposed optimization objective in Equation 1requires access to the internal parameters of thevictim model and, therefore, can only be used inwhite-box jailbreak attacks. We use two commonjailbreak attacks, GCG and AutoDAN, in the exper-iments, and our results are denoted as GCG+Oursand AutoDAN+Ours.Baselines. Our method is compared against sev-eral baselines: clean input, baseline GCG, base-line AutoDAN, and manual jailbreak by applyinga DAN template (Lee, 2023) which is the latestto the date of this writing (detailed in AppendixG). GCG aims to find an adversarial suffix to maxi-mize the probability that the victim model producesa specified affirmative string (Sure, here is ...).AutoDAN generates stealthy jailbreak prompts bya genetic algorithm and utilizing handcrafted jail-break prompts. A detailed description of experi-ment settings is in Appendix B.1.Datasets and Models. During the anchoringprocess, following the setups in , the twoanchor datasets each contains 100 prompts, andthe differences between the two datasets are pri-marily controlled to focus on harmfulness. In theoptimization stage, the target dataset we use in theexperiment consists of all the 520 prompts fromAdvBench (Zou et al., 2023b). The target modelsare Llama-2-7b-chat, Llama-2-13b-chat, Llama-3-8B-Instruct, vicuna-7b-v1.5, and Gemma-7b-it. Inaddition, we take the first 100 results from attackingLlama-2-7b-chat, apply two existing defense meth-ods, perplexity filter and paraphrasing (Jain et al.,2023), and study how ASR is changed. Finally, tostudy the transferability of the proposed method,we use the first 100 attack results from Llama-2-7b- chat as a basis to transfer to four white-box mod-els and two black-box models: Llama-2-13b-chat,Llama-3-8B-Instruct, vicuna-7b-v1.5, Gemma-7b-it, gpt-3.5-turbo-0125, and gpt-4-0125-preview.Metrics.

  "Enhancing Existing Jailbreak Attacks": "We conduct experiments to compare the ASR ofour proposed method and existing methods, and theresults are summarized in . As shown in Ta-ble 2, GCG+Ours generally shows a significant im-provement in ASR. For AutoDAN, our method (Au-toDAN+Ours) demonstrates an increase in ASRon llama2-7b and llama3-8b, remains roughly thesame on llama2-13b and vicuna-7b, but experi-ences a significant decline on gemma-7b.From the results, one can see that our method ex-hibit differences in the performance when appliedto GCG and AutoDAN. To explain the effective-ness of GCG+Ours, as in (learning curve)and (attack trajectory) in Appendix D, forboth GCG and GCG+Ours, the objective smoothlydecreases in the optimization, and the trajectory ofthe attack smoothly moves from the initializationto the end point. As a result, the additional lossconsidered in our method can be fully utilized dur-ing in the optimization to move the attack along theacceptance direction.On the other hand, for AutoDAN, both the learn-ing curve and the attack trajectory implies that thisis a volatile optimization method, and the successof AutoDAN heavily relies on the random search inthe genetic algorithm used in this attack, instead ofminimizing the objective. Therefore, our proposedobjective may not be as effective as in GCG.However, even if AutoDAN is volatile, our Hy-pothesis 4.1 is still valid.

Thismethod evaluates the unreadability of strings byassessing the models output perplexity towardsthe target string.

Theresults for the perplexity filter are divided intoASR(%) and filtering rate(%). ASR shows the over-all rate of succeeded jailbreak after applying theperplexity filter; Filtering rate shows the ratio ofprompts filtered by the defense. By showing filterrate, we can distinguish the reason of a failed attackbetween the prompt being originally failed beforedefense and being defended.From , we can see that for the perplex-ity filter, the filter rate under GCG(+Ours) andAutoDAN(+Ours) behaves totally different. ForGCG(+Ours), the attacks are significantly filtered,with a substantial drop in ASR.

To in-vestigate how paraphrasing affects the overall se-mantic meaning, we calculate the change in therepresentations of the attack before and after de-fense on the first two and other PCA dimensions.From , it is evident that there is a substantialchange in the representation in the first two PCAdimensions, while the representation in the otherdimensions changes little.

  "DExamples of Main Experiment Loss Curves": "displays randomly selected plots of the loss function curves optimized by GCG and AutoDANon the gemma-7b model, both for the baseline and our method. In our method, negative loss valuesoccur because we convert the maximization problem into a minimization problem by taking the negativeof the loss function, which facilitates the code implementation. It shows that the loss function curvesfor AutoDAN fluctuate more drastically than those for GCG, largely reflecting the characteristics ofrandom search to some extent. This speculation is supported by the random selected PCA trajectories onGCG+Ours and AutoDAN+Ours on gemma-7b, as shown in . Therefore, we speculate that inmany cases, the decline of the loss function may not be dominant, resulting in our method, which is basedon changing the loss function, exhibiting suboptimal results in some cases of AutoDAN.",
