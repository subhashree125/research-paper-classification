  "Abstract": "In recent years, instruction fine-tuning (IFT)on large language models (LLMs) has gar-nered considerable attention to enhance modelperformance on unseen tasks. Attempts havebeen made on automatic construction and ef-fective selection for IFT data. However, weposit that previous methods have not fully har-nessed the potential of LLMs for enhancingdata quality. The responses within IFT datacould be further enhanced by leveraging thecapabilities of LLMs themselves. In this paper,we propose COEVOL, an LLM-based multi-agent cooperation framework for the improve-ment of responses for instructions. To effec-tively refine the responses, we develop an it-erative framework following a debate-advise-edit-judge paradigm. A two-stage multi-agentdebate strategy is further devised to ensure thediversity and reliability of editing suggestionswithin the framework. Empirically, modelsequipped with COEVOL outperform compet-itive baselines evaluated by MT-Bench and Al-pacaEval, demonstrating its effectiveness in en-hancing instruction-following capabilities forLLMs. 1",
  "Introduction": "Instruction fine-tuning (IFT) is an effective ap-proach for enhancing the performance of languagemodels in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios on pre-viously unseen tasks. Improving the instruction-following capabilities of large language models(LLMs) has received increasing attentions fromthe natural language processing (NLP) commu-nity (Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Wanget al., 2023a; Longpre et al., 2023). Recent researchhas been focusing on constructing substantial quan-tities of IFT data with minimal human effort (Wang",

By empha-sizing both complexity and diversity of the instruc-tions, Lu et al. (2024) annotate IFT data using ad-vanced LLMs and introduce a complexity-focuseddiverse sampling method for data selection. SinceLIMA (Zhou et al., 2023) suggested that the qualityof IFT data is more important than its quantity, a se-ries of data selection methods have been proposed,focusing on extracting high-quality samples fromexisting datasets of uneven distribution of quali-ties (Li et al., 2023d; Liu et al., 2024; Chen et al.,2024; Xia et al., 2024). However, we observe thatdue to the inherent characteristics of causal lan-guage modeling, LLMs sometimes fail to deliverthe most comprehensive and reasonable answersthey can produce. We posit that previous data con-struction approaches have not fully harnessed thepotential of these LLMs. The responses withinIFT data could be further refined by leveraging thecapabilities of LLMs themselves.Due to the diversity and complexity of instruc-tions within IFT data, refining the present responseis not a trivial task.Consequently, we are at-tempting to introduce multi-agents to cooperatein this endeavor.Although multi-agent debate(MAD) has been proven effective in answer im-provement (Liang et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023) andevaluation (Chan et al., 2024) by prompting thediversity of thought, strengthening the divergentthinking of agents cost-effectively remains chal-lenging. We categorize these approaches into twotypes based on their debate strategies: free debate",

  "What are the three primary colors?": "### RESPONSE:The three primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. These colors cannot be created by mixing other colors together and are used as the base for creating all other colors in the color spectrum. For example, mixing red and blue creates purple, while mixing blue and yellow creates green.",
  ": Overview of the proposed multi-agent cooperation framework CoEvol": "and predetermined-position debate. (1) In a freedebate, participants freely express their opinions onthe topic, and achieving response diversity requiresthe inclusion of more participants in the debateframework. (2) In a predetermined-position debate,one debater opposes the others views, and a judgedecides which side is more persuasive. However,managing the tit for tat nature of the debate posesa difficulty, while variables like speaking order andstatement length can bias the judges decision. Allthese issues make it challenging to refine responsesof IFT data through a multi-agent approach. In this paper, taking inspiration from human co-operation and competition in real-world society,we endeavor to construct superior responses toinstructions with LLM-based multi-agents. Fol-lowing a debate-advise-edit-judge paradigm, wepropose a novel framework named COEVOL toiteratively evolve responses through multi-agentscooperation. In each iteration, the framework ini-tially enhances the diversity and reliability of sub-sequent suggestions through a debate between twodebaters. The debate history is then presented toan advisor to inform their proposal, followed byan editor who modifies the original response ac-cordingly. Finally, a judge evaluates the revisedresponse and determines whether further iterationis necessary. This pipeline enables CoEvol to iden-tify clear and rational evolving directions for theoriginal responses through multi-agent cooperation, resulting in high-quality IFT data. Furthermore, toaddress the aforementioned challenges of previousMAD approaches, we design a two-stage strategywithin the proposed framework. By combining theadvantages of previous methods, our strategy max-imizes the diversity of viewpoints while reducingthe cost of agents. This novel debate strategy en-ables the framework to guide responses to evolvein a reliable and trustworthy manner.We summarize our contributions as follows: (1)We introduce a novel CoEvol framework that fol-lows a debate-advise-edit-judge paradigm to refineresponses within IFT data through multi-agent col-laboration. Instead of selecting high-quality data,our approach focuses on editing the low-qualityresponses of instances to enhance the effectivenessof the IFT data. (2) We propose a two-stage multi-agent debate strategy designed to maximize thediversity of perspectives within the debate whileminimizing the cost of agents. (3) Empirical re-sults over competitive baselines demonstrate theeffectiveness and universality of CoEvol.",
  "Task Assignment": "Before we delve into the detailed design of Co-Evol, concepts involved in the IFT task should beclarified first. In this paper, an IFT data sampleis denoted by x, which comprises the instruction,input, and output components. The instruction typ-ically serves as a description of a task, while theinput represents the specific content of this task.When provided with the given instruction and in-put, the output refers to the response r generatedby LLMs.",
  "Evolution Pipeline": "We find that while LLMs may not consistently of-fer comprehensive and exhaustive responses, theyexcel in recognizing shortcomings within providedresponses and offering recommendations for aug-mentation. Based on this observation, we conceivethe idea of integrating LLM-based multi-agentsinto one pipeline for the iterative refinement ofimperfect data samples.Concretely, we first initialize an experienced ad-visor Aadv through role-play, and ask it to proposewriting suggestions for the given data sample x:",
  "hadv Aadv(x, tadv)(1)": "where x denotes the text sequence constructed byfilling a given template with the data sample x, andtadv signifies the task prompt for the agent advisor.It merits attention that when the original responseis presented to the LLM, it tends to proffer morespecific suggestions, whereas when given only theinstruction, it provides more general advice whichis less helpful for response improvement. Thenwe assign an professional editor Aedt to modifythe original response r referring to the generatedsuggestions:",
  "Throughout this process, we discern that the nu-meric outputs of LLMs occasionally do not corre-spond with their textual content. For this reason,rather than soliciting the judge to rate responses": "and compare scores, we instruct it to select thesuperior response or declare a draw directly fromthe two presented responses. Moreover, to miti-gate the existing position bias inherent within LLMjudges (Ko et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2023), we fol-low Chen et al. (2024) to switch the order of origi-nal and edited response and make two judgments.With these judgments, we then respectively cal-culate scores for r and r according to the followingcriteria:",
  "Debate Strategy": "In our framework, the writing suggestions providedby the advisor explicitly determine the direction ofresponse evolution and thus play an important rolein the evolution pipeline. To further increase thediversity while ensuring the reliability of these sug-gestions, we devise a two-stage debate strategy. Itcombines the advantages of both the predetermined-position debate and the free debate strategy, provid-ing supplemental information from different per-spectives to assist the agent advisor in proposingmore reliable writing suggestions. More specifi-cally, we employ a predetermined-position debatein the first round, subsequently shifting to a freedebate in the second round and conducting a cross-evaluation between the two agents. To mitigate theinfluence of speaking order on the debate, we allowthe debaters to speak concurrently. Predetermined-Position Debate.In the firstround of the debate, we initialize two debate agentswith predetermined-positions. To facilitate bet-ter engagement from the positive and critical de-baters with our prompts, we initially apply role-play prompts to define their respective characters.Subsequently, we provide them with structuredsample content, denoted as x, along with a specific",

To maximize the initial diver-sity of the debate, we instruct the two debaters withcontrary task prompts. Regarding a debate topicwhether the original response accurately answersthe given instruction, we prompt the positive de-bater to support the claim and give reasons, whileasking the critical debater to argue against it andoffer suggestions on how to improve the originalresponse. In this way, we ensure a distinct contrastin viewpoints from the outset of the debate. Free Debate and Cross-Evaluation.In the sec-ond round of the debate, we instruct Apos andAcrt to freely express their opinion and do a cross-evaluation regarding to the previous debate topic.Taking debaters arguments in the first round asreviews towards the given response, we then re-quest both debaters to evaluate the plausibility ofthe opposing debaters prior review in this stage:",
  "Data Refinement": "Based on the proposed two-stage debate strategy,we obtain viewpoints related to the original re-sponse, which are diverse and reliable. Then wesent the generated debate history to the agent ad-visor Aadv, asking it to summarize credible ideasfrom the dialogue and rewrite them into no morethan 3 writing suggestions for improving the givenresponse.

Thenthe agent editor raises helpful writing suggestionsfor response improvement based on the debate his-tory. Referring to these suggestions, an agent editortries to generate an edited response. Finally, a judgeis assigned to compare the original response andthe edited response, deciding whether to update theresponse for further evolution or keep the originalone and break the loop.

  "Preliminary Experiment": "Experimental SetupIn this section, we aim tovalidate the capability of the proposed frameworkCoEvol in enhancing the quality of randomly se-lected IFT data. We use the 52K Alpaca data (Taoriet al., 2023) as the base data pool Dalpaca. Pre-viously, Chen et al. (2024) select 9K high-qualitydata from Dalpaca according to ratings given bygpt-3.5-turbo (abbreviated as Select) and fine-tunea stronger model named ALPAGASUS. Deem it asa competitive baseline approach, we first randomlyselect the same amount of 9K data from Dalpaca toform a dataset (abbreviated as Random). Then Co-Evol is applied to these data for response improve-ment and obtain a dataset with higher quality (ab-breviated as Random + Evol). To fully evolve datasamples, we set the maximum number of iterationsin CoEvol to 3. We fine-tune the pre-trained lan-guage model LLaMA2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023)on aforementioned datasets respectively and evalu-ate them on MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023) as wellas AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023c) automatically. Wenote there exists another relevant IFT data augmen-tation method (Subramaniam et al., 2024), wherecodes and datasets have not been released. Consid-ering the incomplete prompts provided in the paper,we exclude it from the comparative methods in ourexperiments.

Inmodels fine-tuned with less data, the model trainedon data evolved by CoEvol performs better. Asshown in the results, CoEvol significantly improvesthe quality of 9K randomly sampled data, leadingto a superior model for instruction following. Italso outperforms models fine-tuned on full 52Kdata and 9K data selected by LLM-based scoring,This serves as compelling evidence of the efficacyof CoEvol in enhancing the quality of IFT data.Furthermore, it is worth noting that MT-Benchassesses the models performance using bothfirst-turn and second-turn responses to ques-tions, thereby evaluating the models multi-turninstruction-following capability. In contrast, the Al-paca dataset follows a single-turn question-answerformat, resulting in a disparity between the modelsfine-tuning and the evaluation phase. To narrowthis gap and explore the potential of CoEvol, we in-troduce a more diversified experimental setup andconduct further experiments on the framework.",

  "Related Work": "Instruction Fine-tuning for LLMsIn recentyears, instruction fine-tuning (IFT) has become aprevalent approach for enhancing the applicabilityof pre-trained language models (PLMs) and im-proving their generalization capabilities on unseentasks (Chung et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022).For instruction fine-tuning (IFT) on LLMs, at-tempts (Bach et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zhouet al., 2023) have been made to construct IFT data with the help of human annotators, yet these meth-ods are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Totackle this issue, pipelines (Wang et al., 2023a;Honovich et al., 2023) are proposed to automat-ically generate data instances from seed tasks.In addition to single-turn instruction followingdata (Taori et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023), large-scale multi-turn dialogues for IFT are also con-structed to further enhance LLMs on chat scenar-ios (Chiang et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Dinget al., 2023).Concurrently, a series of studiesshow that the complexity, diversity, and qualityof IFT data significantly influence model align-ment. Concerning the complexity of instructions,approaches (Wan et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024; Xuet al., 2024) are designed to create large amounts ofinstruction data with different levels of complexity.Aware of both complexity and diversity of instruc-tions, Lu et al. (2024) tag data with a strong LLMand introduce a complexity-focus diverse samplingmethod for data selection. In the pursuit of datawith high-quality response, Chen et al. (2024) pro-pose a data selection strategy that automaticallyidentifies and removes low-quality data. While Liet al. (2023b) select cherry samples from the origi-nal dataset according to their instruction-followingdifficulty. More recently, Liu et al. (2024) investi-gate plenty of existing data selection methods andpropose approaches for enhanced data measure-ment and selection.Diverging from prior work, we focus on how tofurther improve the quality of responses in IFT data.Through our proposed framework CoEvol, the po-tential of LLM-based multi-agents is unleashedin collaboration to automatically edit responses,thereby generating high-quality data for fine-tuningsuperior LLMs. LLM-based Multi-agent FrameworksAs theability of LLMs to reason and follow instructionscontinues to emerge, wrapping LLMs with addi-tional memories and planning schemes into au-tonomous agents is catching increasing attentionfrom researchers.These agents are capable ofcommunicating with natural language, memorizingtheir experiences, and conducting reflections onassigned tasks.Previously, Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023)indicate that LLMs are effective in simulating be-lievable human behavior when agents are interac-tive from perspectives like observation, planning,and reflection. Li et al. (2023a) focus on how com- municative agents may collaborate autonomouslyto finish tasks. Qian et al. (2023) construct a virtualchat-powered company for software developmentbased on multi-agents. Wang et al. (2023b) trans-form a single LLM into a cognitive synergist byengaging in multi-turn self-collaboration with mul-tiple personas. These practices demonstrate thatmulti-agent frameworks built over LLMs can ef-fectively solve collaborative tasks. Consideringautonomous agents can behave both cooperativelyand competitively, multi-agent debate (MAD) isalso attracting researchers to explore. Du et al.(2023) find that the quality of responses can beimproved through debating over multiple rounds,while (Subramaniam et al., 2024) propose an ap-proach to generate IFT data based on this frame-work. Liang et al. (2023) adopt MAD to addressthe Degeneration-of-Thought issue of reflection-style methods. ChatEval (Chan et al., 2024) offersan automatic human-mimicking evaluation processon NLG tasks based on multi-agents.In this paper, we benefit from the diversity ofthoughts introduced by MAD and design a two-stage strategy within our proposed multi-agent co-operation framework CoEvol.",

  "Limitations": "In this work, we proposed CoEvol, an LLM-basedmulti-agent cooperation framework for improvingIFT data quality through response enhancement.Although experimental results demonstrate that ourframework is viable, there are still some limitationsthat need to be considered: (1) We build multi-agents on top of the same LLM, where the inherentconsistency of the model may lead to the accumu-lation of bias. Further experiments should be doneto investigate the impact of agents based on dif-ferent LLMs on the proposed framework. (2) Dueto time and cost considerations, we conduct ourexperiments on advanced LLMs like gpt-3.5-turboand mixtral. We are also wondering how far themost powerful models like GPT-4 and Claude-3can go when equipped with CoEvol. We plan toexplore this in the future.

  "A.1Sample Prompt Templates": "In this paper, we apply a straightforward rule toconstruct structured samples for agent prompting.Given the varied sources of IFT datasets used inour experiments, the original sample formats wereinconsistent. In practice, vacant sample promptsled agent debaters to comment on informationshortages, which is not what we expected. To ad-dress this mismatch, we implemented two distinctprompt templates for structured sample construc-tion. We present these prompts in .",
  "A.2Role-play and Task Prompts": "We allocate five agents within the proposed pipelineto enhance the quality of responses. In this process,each agent is equipped with a role-play and taskprompt to guide their generation. For models thatallow the specification of system prompts, such asChatGPT, we utilize the role-play prompts as theirsystem prompts. Conversely, for models that donot support system prompts, such as Mixtral, weincorporate the role-play prompt before the taskprompt and provide instructions as a unified input.We present these prompts in , , and for reference.",
  "BDetails of Data Evolution": "To guarantee the stability of the proposed pipeline,we set several hyperparameters to control the frame-work. In our experiments, we set the maximumnumber of iterations for data evolution to 3. ForLLM-based agents, the maximum generated to-kens are restricted to 1000, the temperature is main-tained at 0 for reproducibility, and the top_p valueis set to 1.0. Regarding the data evolution on multi-turn conversations, the expansion of conversationrounds leads to a cumulative increase in historicalinformation within the instructions targeted for op-timization. To mitigate resource consumption, weonly retain the most recent 3 rounds of conversationfor data refinement in the present turn.",
  "CDetails of Model Training": "In our experiments, we fine-tune two pre-trainedlanguage models on different IFT data.To fa-cilitate model training, we employ DeepSpeedZero-Stage 2 (Ren et al., 2021) in model fine-tuning. Specifically, we follow (Chen et al., 2024)to train LLaMA2-7B with a batch size of 512 over 3 epochs. The learning rate is set to 2e-5, anda cosine warmup scheduler with a warm ratio of0.1 is employed. During fine-tuning, we utilizethe LLaMA2-style template to concatenate queriesand responses within multi-turn conversations. Themaximum input length for the model is set to 4096.Regarding Mistral-7B, we follow (Liu et al., 2024)to train the model with a batch size of 512 over6 epochs. The learning rate is set to 2e-5, anda cosine warmup scheduler with a warm ratio of0.1 is employed.

It takes approximately 30 : Evaluation results from both human andLLM judges comparing the enhanced model (COEVOL-Mistral-7BMIXTRAL) with the baseline model (DEITA-Mistral-7B).

The model could take into account factors such assentence structure, language, and source to identify potentiallyfalse information. Additionally, it could also use natural lan-guage processing to automatically detect signs of deception inthe text.",
  "Edit": "## Suggestions(None)## ResponseOne way to use machine learning to identify fake news is bytraining a model on a large dataset of both real and fake newsarticles. The model can then analyze various features of thearticles, such as the language used, the sources cited, and thetone of the writing, to identify patterns that are indicative offake news. By continuously updating and refining the modelbased on new data, it can become increasingly accurate in dis-tinguishing between real and fake news articles. Additionally,natural language processing techniques can be employed toanalyze the content of the articles and detect any misleadingor false information. This approach can help in automatingthe process of identifying fake news and flagging potentiallydeceptive content for further review.",

Include information on the impor-tance of fact-checking and human over-sight in conjunction with machine learn-ing for more accurate identification offake news. ## ResponseMachine learning can be utilized to identify fake news throughvarious algorithms and techniques. For instance, sentimentanalysis can be employed to gauge the emotional tone of anarticle, helping to detect potential bias or manipulation. Addi-tionally, topic modeling can be used to categorize and analyzethe content of news articles, enabling the identification of pat-terns or inconsistencies that may indicate false information.However, it is important to acknowledge the potential chal-lenges and limitations of using machine learning for this pur-pose. One such challenge is the need for large and diversedatasets to train the model effectively, as fake news can takemany different forms and may be context-dependent. More-over, there is a risk of bias in the training data, which couldlead to inaccurate or skewed results.It is crucial to emphasize that while machine learning can bea valuable tool in identifying fake news, it should be com-plemented by human oversight and fact-checking.
