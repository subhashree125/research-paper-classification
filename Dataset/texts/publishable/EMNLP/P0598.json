  "Abstract": "We present a framework for detecting and cat-egorizing noise in literary texts, demonstratedthrough its application to Danish and Norwe-gian literature from the late 19th century. Noise,understood as aberrant sonic behaviour, is notonly an auditory phenomenon but also a cul-tural construct tied to the processes of civiliza-tion and urbanization. We begin by utilizingtopic modeling techniques to identify noise-related documents, followed by fine-tuningBERT-based language models trained on Dan-ish and Norwegian texts to analyze a corpusof over 800 novels. We identify and track theprevalence of noise in these texts, offering in-sights into the literary perceptions of noise dur-ing the Scandinavian Modern Breakthroughperiod (1870-1899). Our contributions includethe development of a comprehensive datasetannotated for noise-related segments and theircategorization into human-made, non-human-made, and musical noises. This study illus-trates the frameworks potential for enhancingthe understanding of the relationship betweennoise and its literary representations, providinga deeper appreciation of the auditory elementsin literary works, including as sources for cul-tural history.",
  "Introduction": "Noise, understood as deviant sonic behaviour(Novak and Sakakeeny, 2015), is an auditory phe-nomenon, but also a cultural construct, closely tiedto processes of civilization and urbanization. Therepresentation of noise in literature provides in-sight into the social and cultural developments ofthe period(s) in which that literature was written.But can we trace how the past may havesounded? In studies of literature and sound, theempirical foundation is often a small selection oftexts, representing either canonical and/or avant-garde instances of 20th century modernism (e.g.,Toth, 2016; Lambrecht, 2017; Frattarola, 2018). In our investigations of the soundscapes in the litera-ture of the Scandinavian Modern Breakthrough(1870-1899), we broaden the empirical and culturalscope by reading at scale. For that, we develop aframework for the detection and categorization ofnoise in literary texts.We extract a series of noise-related topics froma corpus containing more than 800 Danish andNorwegian novels. By examining changes in thefrequency of these topics, we draw insight into howliterary perceptions of noise have evolved. Thefindings of this study contribute to a deeper un-derstanding of the relationship between noise andits various representations in literary contexts, andspecifically, how loud the literary past was. Contributions.Our contributions are: (1) the de-velopment of a robust and scalable framework fordetecting and categorizing noise in literary textsusing fine-tuned language models and topic mod-els; (2) the creation of an annotated dataset derivedfrom over 800 Danish and Norwegian novels fromthe late 19th century, with detailed classificationsof noise-related segments into human-made, non-human made, and musical noises; (3) the implemen-tation of analysis to track the evolution of noise per-ceptions in literature over time, reflecting the cul-tural and social changes in the soundscapes of theScandinavian Modern Breakthrough; and (4) ademonstration of the frameworks applicability andeffectiveness in literary studies, paving the way forfuture research in other linguistic and cultural con-texts.

  "Related Work": "Topic modeling on diachronic text.Variousmethods have been explored for topic modelingin digital humanities and computational literaryanalysis, specifically in diachronic analysis. Chal-lenges in analyzing diachronic data using topic models are discussed in Marjanen et al. (2020),which presents a method for applying topic mod-els to large and imbalanced collections. Heyeret al. (2017) explore detecting semantic changeand term evolution through three approaches andintroduce context volatility as a measure for de-tecting semantic change. The Draw My Topicstoolkit, presented by Dou et al. (2016), uses analgorithm based on Vector Space Model and Con-ditional Entropy to incorporate social scientistsinterests into standard topic modeling. Sirin andLippincott (2024) presented a unique mix of dy-namic embedded topic models and change-pointdetection to analyze the temporal shifts in lexicalsemantic modality in classical and early ChristianLatin texts, offering methods for pattern analysisand integration with traditional literary scholarship,while suggesting future improvements for adaptingto less curated materials. A dynamic embeddedtopic model (D-ETM) combines dynamic latentDirichlet allocation and word embeddings is intro-duced by Dieng et al. (2019) to capture evolvingword patterns over time, demonstrating superiorperformance in document completion tasks andtopic coherence across diverse datasets, with im-proved efficiency in model fitting. Haider (2019)use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for distantreading tasks on literary data, such as classifyingpoems by time periods and authorship attribution,while Tangherlini and Leonard (2013) show howLDA can be used as part of a search and discoverypipeline for literary study and the emergence of top-ics across domains. Finally, Roberts et al. (2013)sStructural Topic Models use metadata to generatetopic prevalence and have had a substantial impactin the social sciences. Noise/sound in literary texts.A strand of in-quiry close to our empirical approach focuses onthe representation of sounds and their associatedsoundscapes within historical and fictional worlds.Schafer (1993) pioneers this approach by exam-ining evolving soundscapes, both real-world andfictional, emphasizing the role of writers as ear-witnesses to past sonic environments.Recentstudies extend this exploration to fictional sound-scapes, exploring how descriptions of ambientsounds contribute to immersive storytelling experi-ences (Verma, 2019; Mildorf, 2019).Further investigations explore specific genres,such as Gothic fiction, to uncover how ambi-ent soundscapes shape narrative atmospheres and reader perceptions (Guhr and Algee-Hewitt, 2024).Fine-tuned BERT models successfully detect andanalyze word-level sound indicators across literarytexts. This interdisciplinary approach not only en-hances our understanding of sounds role in genreclassification but also sheds light on broader narra-tive techniques and reader engagement strategies.",
  "Scandinavian Literary Soundscapes": "Studies in sensory history, and particularly sound-scape studies, stress the importance of the sonicenvironments in which people live and operate.The importance of these soundscapes is based onthe premise that the sounds one hears in a givenplace are as distinctive and as important as thethings one sees there (Birdsall, 2012). 19th centuryurbanized settings presaged a sound revolution,where novel individual sounds and soundscapesrapidly emerged due to new industries, machinery,means of transportation, road surfaces, and the like(Parby, 2021). Simultaneously a fundamental shiftin peoples relationship with sound and noise tookplace, leading some scholars to characterize the19th and early 20th centuries as a particular auscul-tative agean era devoted to sonic experiences, toclose listening and to auscultation not only inthe medical sense initiated by the stethoscope [. . . ]and perfected by the microphone [...] but also inthe sense of careful listening to a world at large.(Picker, 2003).In a Scandinavian context, these sensory eventsare related to the modern breakthrough. Copen-hagen changed radically during this time, with anan explosion in its population, and the introductionof new technologies and infrastructures. As Parby(2021) has shown, these developments led to theemergence of new soundscapes, which were thenincorporated into contemporary fiction. Simultane-ously, authors developed new realist literary tech-niques to give a fuller account of the material worldand to represent it with verisimilitude and detail(Bjerring-Hansen and Wilkens, 2023).",
  "Defining Noise": "In Sound Studies, the definition and phenomeno-logical demarcation of noise has been a point ofconsiderable discussion. Etymologically, the wordnoise is rooted in Latin nausea that encompassesseasickness and nausea, and refers to sounds thatare perceived as excessive, incoherent, confused,or twisted. One of the founders of Sound Stud- ies, Raymond Murray Schafer, proposed a cleardichotomy between natural and man-made noisesfrom, for instance, industrial activity and traffic(Schafer, 1993). This position has later been criti-cized for being a far too normative and rigid divi-sion, where man-made noise almost by definitionis perceived as negative and natural sound eventssuch as thunder claps as positive (Kelman, 2010).Some more subject-sensitive, less normative and,not least, operational definitions, which we relyon, have been suggested by David Novak who de-fines noise as deviant sonic behaviour (Novakand Sakakeeny, 2015), and Peter Bailey who de-fines it as sound out of place paraphrasing anthro-pologist Mary Douglas classic definition of dirt asmatter out of place (Bailey, 1996).In order to develop an operational conceptualframework, we use a very basic definition of noiseas silence-breaking; this characterization meansthat noise can include moderate sounds such aswhispering or mumbling voices as long as they arenoted as sonic events in the text. It also means thatwe include neutral sonic phenomena, such as thisdescription of factory whistles:",
  "The steam pipes sounded from all the factories, itwas 8 oclock. And I had to leave. (transl.)": "The quote says nothing about whether the whis-tles are perceived as noise by the character or narra-tor. But, obviously, the sound distinctively breaksa silence.Based on our knowledge of industrialization andurbanization, as discussed in international SoundStudies research and reflected in literary sources,our hypothesis in the following is that during thelatter part 19th century the general noise levels in-creased, correlated with an increasing sensitivitytowards noise, in a development more and moredominated by non-human noise sources.",
  "Main Corpus": "For our main target data, we rely on the MeMocorpus (Bjerring-Hansen et al., 2022), comprising859 Danish and Norwegian novels spanning thelast 30 years of the 19th century, with more than64 million tokens. We refer to this corpus as the main corpus. The corpus is a rich and diverse col-lection of texts that provides valuable insights intothe representations of noise and sound during theperiod under investigation. shows statisti-cal information about the corpus. We segment thecorpus into paragraphs and split them into 50-wordsegments if they exceed 50 words.",
  "Noise Detection Dataset": "To construct a dataset of text segments annotatedfor whether they contain noise or not, we combinea selection of hand-picked segments by a histo-rian expert, with a topic-based search approach toenrich the dataset. Segments Extraction.We apply BERTopic(Grootendorst, 2022), a powerful topic modelingtechnique that enables us to cluster millions of textsegments from the MeMo corpus into a conciseset of topics. By doing so, we aim to distill vastamounts of textual data into manageable thematicclusters, facilitating subsequent analysis. Follow-ing the topic modeling phase, we filter the gener-ated topics, focusing our attention on those mostrelevant to the concept of noise. These selectedtopics serve as a foundation for further exploration,guiding us in identifying and annotating text seg-ments specifically related to noise. showsthe list of topics that are used to extract the textsegments from the main corpus. We remain with5,700 text segments related to noise topics, whichare then carefully annotated by experts. Annotation Guidelines.The annotation involvestwo of the authors, native Danish speakers, a his-torian with special interests in urban and socialhistory as well as a literary scholar familiar withthe social conditions of 19th century literature, whoclassified segments into two categories: noise andnon-noise. This differentiation is by no means triv-ial.With the conceptual distinctions and demarca-tions in 4 in mind, the annotation of noise and non-",
  ": List of selected topics with English translations": "noise text segments is carried out on the basis ofthe following, minimalist and pragmatic guidelines,respecting the principle that clear and simple in-structions are crucial for obtaining high-quality an-notations (Mohammad, 2016), while also acknowl-edging the intricacies that the analysis of literarytexts based on small fragmentary segments raises. 1. Based on our definition of noise, the text seg-ments are labeled either 1 (positive) or 0(negative). Our focal point is that we wouldrather narrow the focus later on (through addi-tional annotation of positive cases, metadata-filtering, or NLP measures) than exclude spe-cific types of noise. Along the way, our defi-nition becomes even richer, as we realize thatmusic should also be included, as music isoften interwoven with other types of sonicevents, as we see in this example:",
  "She felt engulfed by a buzzing electric cur-rent. (transl.)": "Annotation Results.Our hand-picked selectionof noise segments include 217 positive examples,manually curated from various 19th century sources(memoirs, essays and fictional works). As for thesegments obtained with the topic-based search, outof the pool of 5700 segments, 337 are deemednoise-related while the remaining segments are an-notated as non-noise.In our endeavor to encompass the entirety of thetarget corpus, we turn our attention to the remaining5,365 segments, considering them as non-noisesegments. To ensure the datasets comprehensive-ness and diversity, we supplement these non-noisesegments with an additional 5,000 segments ran-domly selected from various non-noise topics.We randomly sample 175 segments from thenoise-related topics to serve as our testing set, eachannotated independently by our two annotators, toevaluate annotation consistency and assess modelperformance. The resulting Cohens Kappa value,calculated to measure inter-annotator agreement,yielded a score of 0.85, indicating a high level ofagreement between the annotations.",
  "Noise Categorization Dataset": "Fine-grained categorization of noise-related seg-ments is essential in the context of classifying tex-tual noise extracted from literary texts. This ap-proach enables a nuanced understanding of the di-verse forms of noise present within the textual cor-pus, including but not limited to, linguistic anoma-lies, contextual inconsistencies, and stylistic irregu-larities. By classifying noise into categories suchas human noise, mechanical noise, and other typesof textual disturbances, one can distinguish specificsources of interference more accurately, reflectingthe intricacies inherent in literary compositions. Annotation Guidelines.To get closer to an un-derstanding of sound as a cultural phenomenonas reflected in literary works, we perform anotherround of annotation. Although we have severalspecific research interests related to sonic develop-ments in the 19th century, in order to (a) reduce thenumber of axes in the annotation, which might havenegative consequences for the predictive power ofthe model, and (b) produce a more broadly usefuldataset, we choose to prioritize one aspect of thenoise segments, namely the sound source. In do-ing so, we have disregarded features, which, in afuture, extended pipeline, may come into play, notleast time (traditional or modern sound?) and place(rural or urban sound?).For this round of annotation, we merge the noise-related segments from the previous dataset and ad-ditional segments from the MeMo corpus after theprediction of noise and non-noise classes for eachsegment in the corpus as shown in . Then,the (same two) annotators classified text segmentsinto the following categories: Non-human madenoise (T), Human-made noise (H), Undefined noise(N), and Music (M), following these criteria to en-sure an accurate and consistent categorization: 1. Non-human made noise encompasses anynoise not produced by humans, ranging frommachine-produced sonic events (such as steamengines, trams, telephones etc.) to naturalones (caused by wind, rain, animals etc.).",
  ". Often there is a mix of sound sources in theindividual text segments, as here (non-humanmade, human made, music):": "From time to time there were snatches of aloud violins dance tunes. Lonely cabs rum-bled through the street, with snow-dampedwheels and a few swishing whistles thatmade a couple of heads turn in the window.Every now and then a streetcar threw itsjingle of bells and chimes into the whispersand murmurs of conversation. (transl.)",
  "Here, non-human made noise dominates, sothe label is T. In other cases, the categoriza-tion of mixed segments is based on a moreuncertain basis and is open to interpretation": "Annotation Results.Following the annotationprocess, we have a total of 1,874 text segments an-notated by two independent annotators. Annotateddata statistics are presented in . The trainingset, encompassing 91% of the total annotations,consists of 1,699 segments, while the test set, com-prising 9%, consists of 175 segments. After theremoval of non-noise segments, the total numberof segments in the dataset is 1,244. Notably, bothannotators annotate all segments within the testset, ensuring comprehensive coverage and reliabil-ity. Our obtained Cohens Kappa value of 0.81demonstrates a substantial agreement level, surpass-ing chance expectations. They exchange opinionson the interpretation of borderline cases, especiallyregarding segments including a multitude of noisesources, in order to establish a common understand-ing of the different noise categories. As a resultof these initial considerations we also decided togive music its own category. This result under-scores the robust and accurate classification of thedata, reflecting strong and reliable consistency inthe annotations provided by both annotators. Notethat in the training set, each annotator individually",
  "Pre-trained Language Models": "In this subsection, we outline the models evaluatedin our noise detection and categorization classifi-cation experiments using supervised fine-tuningmethods.Importantly, all models are selectedbased on their performance evaluated on Danishand Norwegian literary benchmark datasets (Al-Laith et al., 2024) and ScandEval1 (Nielsen, 2023),even though these models had not been trainedprimarily on historical Danish or Norwegian. DanskBERT.DanskBERT2, a top-performingDanish language model noted for its success onthe ScandEval benchmark (Snbjarnarson et al.,2023), is based on the XLM-RoBERTa architec-ture and trained on the Danish Gigaword Corpus(Strmberg-Derczynski et al., 2021). It features 24layers, a hidden dimension of 1024, 16 attentionheads, and a subword vocabulary of 250,000. Themodel was trained with a batch size of 2,000 for500,000 steps on 16 V100 GPUs over two weeks. Danish Foundation Models sentence encoder.A sentence-transformers model (Enevoldsen et al.,2023) based on the BERT architecture, featuring24 layers, 16 attention heads, and a hidden size of1024. It incorporates a dropout rate of 0.1 for atten-tion probabilities and hidden states, using GELUactivation and supporting up to 512 position em-beddings. With a vocabulary size of 50,000 tokens,this model, referred to as DFM (Large), excels intasks such as Danish sentiment analysis and namedentity recognition.3 MeMo-BERT-03.Developed by continuing thepre-training of the Transformer PLM DanskBERT(Al-Laith et al., 2024).4 This foundation allowsMeMo-BERT-3 to leverage extensive linguisticknowledge for NLP tasks in historical literary Dan-ish including sentiment analysis and word sensedisambiguation. The model outperformed differ-ent models in sentiment analysis and word sensedisambiguation tasks (Al-Laith et al., 2024). NB-BERT-base.A general-purpose BERT-basemodel was developed using the extensive digitalcollection at the National Library of Norway (Kum-mervold et al., 2021).5 It follows the architectureof the BERT Cased multilingual model and hasbeen trained on a diverse range of Norwegian texts,encompassing both Bokml and Nynorsk from thepast 200 years. This comprehensive training al-lows the NB-BERT-base to effectively handle awide array of NLP tasks in Norwegian. The modelachieved the second-highest performance rankingin the Norwegian Named Entity Recognition taskcompared to other models listed on the ScandEvalbenchmark for Norwegian natural language under-standing.",
  "Experimental Setup": "In this section, we outline the experimental setupemployed for the supervised classification tasks fo-cused on both noise detection and noise categoriza-tion. Our experiments involve fine-tuning severalpre-trained language models on the fine-graineddatasets. All layers of the selected models were ac-tively trained to optimize performance. The detailsof the dataset and the models used are describedbelow. For the training procedure, the experimentsinvolve fine-tuning BERT models on the dataset us-ing a batch size of 32, training for 20 epochs withthe AdamW optimizer at a learning rate of 103.During training, we monitored both training andvalidation losses to assess model convergence andprevent overfitting. For evaluation, we employedthe F1-score metric due to its ability to balanceprecision and recall, particularly effective for taskswith imbalanced datasets like noise detection andcategorization. The performance of each modelwas evaluated on both validation and test sets, en-suring the robustness and generalizability of themodels across different datasets and epochs.",
  "Noise Detection Experiments": "It is important to note the deliberate imbalancewithin the dataset, where only 5% of the anno-tated segments are noise-related. By favoring ahigher representation of non-noise segments, weaim to bias our model toward accurately identify-ing and capturing instances of noise within the data.This approach is designed to enhance the modelssensitivity to noise while maintaining robustness inits classification capabilities.Fine-tuning the PLMs on the noise detection taskresults in notable performance variations ().DanskBERT achieves a validation accuracy of 0.89and a test accuracy of 0.83, indicating robust per-formance across unseen data. MeMo-BERT-03demonstrated the highest validation accuracy at0.90, although its test accuracy slightly decreasedto 0.80. In contrast, DFM (Large) exhibited a vali-dation accuracy of 0.81, dropping significantly to0.55 on the test set, suggesting potential overfit-ting or limited generalizability. NB-BERT-baseachieved consistent results with a validation accu-racy of 0.88 and a test accuracy of 0.76, indicatingreliable performance across both validation and testdatasets. These results highlight the effectivenessof fine-tuned BERT variants, especially MeMo-BERT-03 and DanskBERT, in accurately detectingnoise within textual data, while emphasizing theimportance of robust evaluation across multiplemodels and datasets. also shows a detailedof result of precision and recall of positive class.",
  "Noise Categorization Experiments": "The dataset comprises 1,244 text segments, dividedinto training, validation, and testing sets for modeldevelopment and evaluation. The training set in-cludes 961 examples, constituting 77% of thedataset, while the validation set, used for hyper-parameter selection, consists of 178 samples, rep-resenting 14% of the total. The testing set, forthe final model evaluation, contains 105 examples,or 9% of the dataset. Annotations for the train-ing and validation sets were made by a single ex-pert. For the testing set, only segments where bothexperts agreed on the annotations were retained,discarding those with conflicting annotations. Weuse the weighted average F1-score as the evalua-tion metric. Notably, MeMo-BERT-03 achievedthe highest F1-score of 83% on the validation set,while the DanskBERT model achieved the highestF1-score of 83% on the test set. showsdetailed results for each model.",
  "Diachronic Analysis of Noise Segments": "Having trained accurate noise detection and cate-gorization classifiers, we use the best ones (Dan-skBERT fine-tuned on the two tasks respectively) topredict labels for all segments in the entire MeMocorpus. We then quantify the frequency of the oc-currence of noise over time in the corpus, as wellas the distribution of the different categories.",
  "Noise Occurrences over Time": "After fine-tuning multiple pre-trained PLMs, Dan-skBERT emerged as the top performer among thefour models evaluated, and we selected it for pre-dicting noise and non-noise classes across all seg-ments in the main corpus. Notably, out of 1.9million segments in the corpus, 220,378 were pre-dicted with the noise class. shows theproportion of noise segments over the years.A trend of rising noise levels in the novels isclear: From the 1870s to the 1890s there is a morethan 50 % relative increase of noise (followed by aslight decline or a plateau by the end of the decade).",
  "Discussion": "Annotation nuances.Given the complex andslippery character of noise as a cultural phe-nomenon, we chose to disregard both spatial as-pects (where?) and historical aspects (when?) re-lated to it. For pragmatic reasons, we decided ona basic categorization by annotating noise classes(based on noise sources). There were challenges inmaking categorical decisions about specific noiseevents in the texts, for instance when there was amix of noise sources simultaneously at play and,not least, in relation to our crucial distinction be-tween non-human made and human made noise,according to which in the former category, it is hu-mans themselves who generate sound (with theirvoice or body), while in the latter, technology isperceived as an agent and humans as mere opera-tors (e.g. of a ringing church bell or a screechingstreetcar). Our categories proved to be operational,but they are by no means watertight. We havelearned more about noise as a historical concept,but also about its dynamic way of manifesting itselfin different contexts and literary representations.",
  "Model performance.Interestingly, while MeMo-BERT-03 achieved the highest validation scores,": "DanskBERT outperformed it on the test set forboth noise detection and categorization (),suggesting it is more capable at generalizing to un-seen segments. While the former is designed to bebetter attuned to nuances in the historical corpus,in some cases, the latter (which was trained on adiverse corpus consisting mostly of modern Dan-ish) might be better at detecting modernity signals,which are the focus of our annotation framework. Noise trends.Our results confirm our hypothesisthat in the last three decades of the 19th century arise of general noise levels as well as an increase inpreoccupation with noise are reflected in the novelsof the time. The upward trend is clear. It does, how-ever, flatten or fall by the end of the period. Thisis hardly due to less noise, but rather to the factthat the authors and their characters are less pre-occupied with it. Our hypothesis, which must besupported by close inspection and reading, is thatnoise is taken for granted or implied on the brink ofthe 20th century. In contrast to our initial hypothe-sis, human-made noise remains at a relatively highlevel throughout the period. This fits well with ob-servations from the larger European metropoliseslike Paris, London and Madrid, where the policingof human noise sources remain significant, whereasindustrial sounds tends to be evaluated positivelyand is not the focus of anti-noise campaigns untilthe early 20th century. The results from our noisecategorization do however call for further time- andplace-attentive investigation.",
  "Conclusion": "We presented a framework for detecting and cate-gorizing noise in literary texts and demonstratedits usefulness in the MeMo corpus. Using topicmodeling and fine-tuned BERT-based models, weextracted and analyzed relevant text segments, pro-viding new insights into the cultural and socialtransformations reflected in the soundscapes ofthe Scandinavian Modern Breakthrough period.Our study demonstrates that literary perceptions ofnoise can be effectively tracked and categorized,revealing significant patterns and trends. We havebeen able to add new perspectives on the interplaybetween literature and cultural history and to em-pirically underpin hypotheses of the 19th centuryas a particular auscultative era.Future work will extend this framework to ex-plore the impact of industrialization, examininghow technological advancements and urbanization influenced literary soundscapes. We will also inves-tigate the spatial dimensions of noise, contrastingrural and urban settings. Further, we would like todo comparative analysis on other datasets to situateour study in a broader context, such as contempo-rary civil complaints (as documented in the CityArchives), and/or a corpus of modern Danish nov-els (from The World Literature Data Collective).Additionally, we plan to analyze the lexical diver-sity in the terms used to portray noise, to get a betterunderstanding of the psychological and cognitiveaspects of the increased awareness of noise in theearly phases of urbanization and industrialization.",
  "Limitations": "Despite the strengths of our framework, there areseveral limitations to consider. First, the focus onDanish and Norwegian literature from a specifichistorical period may limit the generalizability ofour findings to other linguistic and cultural con-texts. Second, the accuracy of our noise detectionand categorization relies heavily on the quality ofthe annotations and the pre-trained language mod-els, which may not capture all nuances of noiserepresentation in literary texts. Third, our currentanalysis does not account for the broader contextualelements surrounding noise occurrences, such asnarrative structure or character perspectives, whichcould provide a deeper understanding of the literarysoundscapes. Finally, while our framework demon-strates promising results, further validation acrossdiverse datasets and more complex noise catego-rization schemes is necessary to fully establish itsrobustness and applicability.",
