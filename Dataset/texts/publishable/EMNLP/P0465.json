  "Abstract": "The utilization of Large Language Models(LLMs) in financial trading has primarily beenconcentrated within the stock market, aidingin economic and financial decisions. Yet, theunique opportunities presented by the cryp-tocurrency market, noted for its on-chain datastransparency and the critical influence of off-chain signals like news, remain largely un-tapped by LLMs. This work aims to bridgethe gap by developing an LLM-based trad-ing agent, CryptoTrade, which uniquely com-bines the analysis of on-chain and off-chaindata. This approach leverages the transparencyand immutability of on-chain data, as wellas the timeliness and influence of off-chainsignals, providing a comprehensive overviewof the cryptocurrency market. CryptoTradeincorporates a reflective mechanism specifi-cally engineered to refine its daily trading de-cisions by analyzing the outcomes of priortrading decisions. This research makes twosignificant contributions. Firstly, it broadensthe applicability of LLMs to the domain ofcryptocurrency trading.Secondly, it estab-lishes a benchmark for cryptocurrency trad-ing strategies. Through extensive experiments,CryptoTrade has demonstrated superior per-formance in maximizing returns compared totime-series baselines, but not compared to tra-ditional trading signals, across various cryp-tocurrencies and market conditions. Our codeand data are available at",
  "Introduction": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionizedfinancial decision-making and stock market predictionby excelling in tasks such as sentiment analysis (Lianget al., 2022) and explanation generation (Pu et al., 2023).Specialized models like FinGPT and BloombergGPT(Liu et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023) demonstrate this capa-bility. Recent research highlights their ability to inter-pret financial time-series and enhance cross-sequence",
  "Equal Contribution, Ordered Alphabetically": "reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2023; Zhang et al.,2023; Zhao et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024). Further-more, the development of LLM-based trading agentslike Sociodojo (Cheng and Chin, 2024) underscores thepotential for innovating investment strategies.However, the application of LLMs in the cryptocur-rency market remains underexplored, yet this field holdsgreat potential for future development for three main rea-sons. First, the cryptocurrency market is characterizedby high market value, volatility, and uncertainty, whichchallenge traditional trading signals (Drozdz et al., 2023;Wei et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024). Second, LLMs havedemonstrated their ability to understand and analyzefinancial markets by leveraging large volumes of multi-modal data, such as news and price information (Wuet al., 2023). Third, the cryptocurrency market includesopen-sourced on-chain data, such as gas prices and totaltransaction values, providing insights beyond just pricemovements (Feichtinger et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2023;Luo et al., 2023). To bridge this gap, we introduce Cryp-toTrade. By integrating on-chain data, including marketdata and transaction records, with off-chain informa-tion like financial news, CryptoTrade leverages bothdimensions to execute daily trading strategies, takingfull advantage of the transparency of on-chain data andthe immediacy of off-chain information. We detail thestructure of CryptoTrade in .CryptoTrade consists of a three-part framework. Ini-tially, we collect data where on-chain details such astransactions and broader market data are aggregatedalongside off-chain data from established financial newsoutlets like Bloomberg and Yahoo Finance. After datacollection, we perform statistical analyses to calculateindicators such as moving averages, and apply text pro-cessing techniques for news summarization using thesame GPT models that will later be employed for anal-ysis: GPT-3.5-turbo1, GPT-42, and GPT-4o3. Finally,we enhance day-to-day decision-making with special-ized analytical agents: market analyst agent evaluatesmarket trends, news analyst agent interprets recent newsimpacts, and trading agent deliberates on investment CryptoTrade makes day-to-day trading decisions.",
  "Agent": "Trading AgentReflection Agent Whats the market trend from statistics? Whats the market trend from news? Today, we buy/sell/hold BTC because Did we make profits? Why? On-chain Data Off-chain Data : CryptoTrade Framework. Our framework begins with the collection of various types of data, includingon-chain transactions, market data, and off-chain data from multiple financial news sources. We extract on-chainstatistics while summarizing off-chain news to provide comprehensive inputs for our agents analysis. We thendeploy several LLM-based agents to make day-to-day trading decisions, utilizing a reflective mechanism to maximizetotal returns over different time periods. actions. Concurrently, reflection agent reviews past per-formance, allowing CryptoTrade to refine its strategiesto maximize returns.Then, we conduct comprehensive experiments withCryptoTrade using GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4o,evaluating its proficiency in making daily trading deci-sions for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana(SOL). These three cryptocurrencies were selected fortheir prominence and market values of $134.14, $45.59,and $7.61 billion, respectively, as of June 2nd, 20244.CryptoTrade significantly outperforms time-series base-lines such as Informer (Zhou et al., 2021) and PatchTST(Nie et al., 2022), and achieves comparable performanceto trading signals like Moving Average Convergence Di-vergence (MACD) (Gencay, 1996) in both return andsharpe ratio across bull, sideways, and bear market con-ditions. Notably, CryptoTrade operates in a zero-shotmanner without fine-tuning based on validation sets,highlighting its potential for future applications. Forinstance, during the ETH bullish test period, the Buyand Hold strategy secured a 22.59% return, while Cryp-toTrade exceeded this by a remarkable 3%.To summarize, we make the following three contribu-tions:",
  "timized trading decisions specifically for the cryp-tocurrency market, setting a new benchmark in thisfield": "We develop a comprehensive framework for cryp-tocurrency trading agents that encompasses the col-lection of both on-chain and off-chain data, alongwith the integration of a self-reflective componentto enhance decision-making processes. This ap-proach aggregates diverse information sources andestablishes a new standard for data-driven tradingstrategies within the cryptocurrency domain. Through rigorous experiments, we present empir-ical evidence showcasing the efficacy of Crypto-Trade compared to other baselines. CryptoTradeadvances the frontier of cryptocurrency tradingtechnologies and offers valuable insights for finan-cial decision-making.",
  "The foundation of our methodology relies on a compre-hensive collection of data from on-chain and off-chain": "sources, which is essential for making informed trad-ing decisions in the cryptocurrency market. The datalicense is detailed in Appendix A. The data ethics areexplained in Appendix B. The data collection strategyis illustrated in (a) and further detailed below: On-chain Data: We leverage historical data fromCoinMarketCap5, which provides daily insightsinto prices, trading volumes, and market capitaliza-tion of various cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, SOL.This dataset forms the backbone of our markettrend analysis, enabling us to decipher long-termtrends and identify cycles in cryptocurrency valua-tions and investor behavior. Additionally, we incorporate detailed transac-tion statistics from on-chain activities.Allblockchain transactions are transparent, trace-able, and publicly accessible, achieved throughsecurely linked blocks using cryptographic tech-niques (Narayanan et al., 2016). As numerousprominent blockchain explorers provide tools foreasy access to blockchain transaction data, we re-trieve on-chain transaction data from the DuneDatabase6, a crypto analytics platform, and con-struct comprehensive statistics related to thesetransactions to include information on market dy-namics. This includes comprehensive metrics suchas daily number of transactions, number of activewallet, total value transferred, average gas price,and total gas consumed. These features are cru-cial for understanding the operational aspects ofblockchains, such as network congestion times andcost efficiency, which directly impact trading strate-gies. Our daily collection of these metrics facili-tates a nuanced analysis of market dynamics andliquidity, allowing for real-time adjustments to ourtrading algorithms based on current market condi-tions. Off-chain Data: We employ the Gnews API7 tosystematically gather news articles related to eachcryptocurrency. This tool enables us to access awide array of sources through Google News, pro-viding a comprehensive daily snapshot of mar-ket sentiment. Moreover, we particularly focuson filtering news from reputable financial andcryptocurrency-specific outlets such as Bloomberg,Yahoo Finance, and crypto.news8 to ensure the re-liability and relevance of the information. For eachday, relevant articles were searched using the nameof each cryptocurrency as a keyword to ensure allcollected news articles were directly related to thatcryptocurrency. This approach helped exclude alarge amount of unrelated news. In this way, onaverage, we collected 47.1 news articles related to Bitcoin, 42.6 news articles related to Ethereum,and 15.7 news articles related to Solana. Then,we filtered the news by their source to further en-hance relevance and reliability. Finally we willuse no more than 5 news every day for each cryp-tocurrency. The integration of analysis from thesearticles allows us to capture the markets sentimentand response to developments, which is often aprecursor to significant market movements. By merging both on-chain data and off-chain newsinsights, our methodology offers a holistic view of thecryptocurrency market. This integration not only en-hances our analytical capabilities but also significantlyimproves the precision of our trading decisions.",
  "Market and News Analyst Agents": "Upon collecting extensive on-chain and off-chain data,we analyze it through two key components of our Cryp-toTrade agent: (1) market analyst agent, (2) news an-alyst. By leveraging the capabilities of GPT models,these analysts provide deep insights into the crypto mar-ket, enabling informed and strategic trading decisions.Market Analyst Agent. The market analyst agentplays a crucial role in deciphering market dynam-ics through the statistical analysis of key trading sig-nals from on-chain data, such as MA (Gencay, 1996),MACD (Wang and Kim, 2018), and Bollinger Bands(Day et al., 2023). Details of these trading signals areprovided in Appendix E. Armed with this information,the market analyst agent compiles reports on the mar-kets direction and momentum. An example is shown in.News Analyst Agent. The news analyst agent istasked with extracting and analyzing critical informa-tion from the latest news to assess the potential marketimpact of off-chain social hype. By sourcing news sum-maries from various trusted sources, the news analystagent pinpoints relevant recent events and assesses thesignificance and implications of key topics, thus addingan extra dimension of insight. An example is providedin .",
  "Trading Agent": "Each day, the trading agent offers an investment sugges-tion based on reports from the market and news analystagents. After analyzing the reports, the trading agentprovides a concise rationale for its decisions. It also rec-ommends allocating a certain portion of remaining cashto purchase cryptocurrency (with a range from (0 to 1]),selling a certain portion of owned cryptocurrency (witha range from [1 to 0)), or holding (neither buying norselling). When a trading decision is made, a transactionfee is charged in proportion to the traded value. illustrates an example of our trading agents operations.",
  "Experiment Environments. We conduct all experi-ments using PyTorch on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX3090 GPU. More details are in Appendix C": "Datasets. To ensure our experiments are robust acrossdifferent cryptocurrencies and market conditions, webase our study on a dataset covering several months,detailed in . This dataset reflects the recent mar-ket performance of BTC, ETH, and SOL, presentingchallenges in capturing market trends and volatility. Wedivide the dataset into validation and test sets, using theformer to select model hyperparameters and the latterto evaluate model performance. We carefully select thetest period after September 2021, the GPT-3.5s knowl-edge cutoff date, to prevent data leakage. The datasetencompasses three market conditions: bull, sideways,and bear, allowing us to test the effectiveness of boththe baselines and our model (Baroiu et al., 2023; Cagan,2024), ensuring reliable and robust experimental results. Evaluation Scheme. We initialize the trading agentwith 1 million US dollars, split equally between cashand BTC/ETH/SOL, to enable potential profits fromboth buying and selling cryptocurrencies. At the endof the trading session, we use the following widely-accepted metrics: Return, Sharpe Ratio, Daily ReturnMean, and Daily Return Std. This evaluation schemeensures a rigorous and unbiased assessment of bothbaseline strategies and our CryptoTrade agent.(1) Return measures the overall performance ofthe trading strategy, calculated using the formulawendwstart",
  "wstart, where wstart and wend represent the start-ing and ending net worth, respectively.(2) Sharpe Ratio assesses the risk-adjusted return,using the formula rrf": ", where r is the mean of dailyreturns, is the standard deviation of daily returns, andrf is the risk-free return, set to 0 following SocioDojo(Cheng and Chin, 2024).(3) Daily Return Mean is the average of the dailyreturns over the trading period, providing insight intothe typical daily performance of the trading strategy.(4) Daily Return Std is the standard deviation of thedaily returns, indicating the volatility and risk associatedwith the daily performance of the trading strategy. Baseline Strategies. To benchmark the performance ofour CryptoTrade agent, we compare it against widelyrecognized baseline strategies in the trading domain.We present these baselines and hyperparameters in Ap-pendix E.",
  "Experimental Results": "The performance comparison presented in , Ta-ble 3, between various trading strategies and ourproposed CryptoTrade agent reveals significant insightsinto the efficacy of incorporating advanced data analysistechniques for cryptocurrency trading. The table high-lights the returns and Sharpe Ratios for each method,where our CryptoTrade agent performs with outstand-ing percentage return and Sharpe Ratio compared withtime-series baselines but not superior than traditionaltrading signals: Buy and Hold and SLMA. We outlinethe superiority of CryptoTrade in the following two keyaspects: Superior Performance under Different Market Con-ditions. Remarkably, even without fine-tuning, Crypto-Trade outperforms Transformer-based time-series base-lines in most bases, demonstrating the robust capabili-ties of LLMs. Additionally, its performance is compara-ble to traditional trading signals like Buy and Hold andMACD, further validating the potential of LLM-basedapproaches. For instance, CryptoTrade (GPT-4o) excelsin all metrics under ETHs bull market by 3% in totalreturn and sharpe ratio. While CryptoTrade (GPT-4o)may not always be the top performer in every scenario,it consistently surpasses more than half of the tradingsignals across different market conditions, even withoutfine-tuning. This highlights the effectiveness and ver-satility of CryptoTrade in leveraging LLMs to navigatethe complexities of the cryptocurrency market.Successful Trend Predictions. We draw todemonstrate the correlation between Ethereums open-ing prices and the positions held by the CryptoTradeagent, with the yellow and blue lines representing dailyopening prices and Ethereum positions, respectively.The observed fluctuations highlight the markets volatil-ity, while the alignment between position adjustmentsand price movements showcases the agents proficiencyin anticipating market trends. Unlike the static Buy andHold strategy, CryptoTrade adopts a dynamic approach,optimizing trades based on market analysispurchasingat lower prices and selling at peaks. This strategicadaptability, especially evident during shaded periodsof preemptive position changes in anticipation of priceshifts, underscores the agents capacity for risk manage-ment and its adeptness at leveraging market volatilityfor profit, marking a significant advancement over tradi-tional trading strategies.",

  "Case Study": "To assess the adaptability and responsiveness of theCryptoTrade agent, we conduct a case study focusingon its responsive actions in the context of the cryptocur-rency markets major events, illustrated in . Itreveals that CryptoTrades strategy aligns with the \"buythe rumor, sell the news\" principle, effectively capitaliz-ing on early signs of the Bitcoin ETF approval event, ascenario known to trigger market rallies due to specula-tive trading. By entering the market early, CryptoTradesecures positions at lower costs ahead of the rally.As the approval of the Bitcoin ETF becomes a reality,the sentiment reaches a crescendo, resulting in inflatedasset prices due to heightened demand. CryptoTrade,adhering to its strategic motivation, takes this peak asan optimal point to sell, which is validated in the subse-quent decline in the Ethereum price. This strategic exitallows CryptoTrade to realize gains before the marketadjusted to the new equilibrium, which results in a pricepullback as early speculators take profits and the marketsentiment normalizes.To sum up, CryptoTrades provident actions under-score the delicate balance between foresight and timingin trading strategies. This case study demonstrates thatan informed and timely response to market signals both rumors and confirmed news can yield advan-tageous outcomes. It also highlights the CryptoTradeagents understanding of market psychology and its abil-ity to translate this into profitable trading decisions.4Related Work",
  "LLMs for Economics and Financial Decisions Recentadvancements in LLMs have significantly influencedeconomics and financial decision-making. Specialized": "LLMs like FinGPT, BloombergGPT, FinMA (Liu et al.,2023; Wu et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023) are tailoredfor finance, handling tasks such as sentiment analysis,entity recognition, and question-answering. Anotherresearch direction uses LLMs for financial time-seriesforecasting. A notable contribution by (Yu et al., 2023)employed zero-shot or few-shot inference with GPT-4and instruction-based fine-tuning with LlaMA to en-hance cross-sequence reasoning and multi-modal signalintegration. Additionally, the development of LLM-based agents for financial trading has gained attention.Sociodojo (Cheng and Chin, 2024) created analyticalagents for stock portfolio management, showing the po-tential for generating \"hyperportfolios.\" Despite theseadvancements, the focus has largely been on the stockmarket (Koa et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023), leavinga gap in the exploration of the cryptocurrency marketwhere the on-chain data is approachable and with muchinformation. Our work aims to address this gap by lever-aging both on-chain and off-chain data to navigate thedynamic cryptocurrency market. Time-Series Forecasting for Financial MarketsTime-series forecasting has long been a cornerstoneof research in economics and financial markets. Earlystudies focused on predicting stock market prices us-ing methodologies such as machine learning (Leunget al., 2021; Patel and Yalamalle, 2014), reinforcementlearning (Lee, 2001), and traditional time-series mod-els (Herwartz, 2017). The Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) model has emerged as particularly influential(Sunny et al., 2020) for its capability to process andanalyze time-series data. With the rise of blockchaintechnology and cryptocurrencies, these techniques havebeen extended to crypto assets (Khedr et al., 2021). Re- cent research has evaluated the impact of various predic-tors on cryptocurrency pricing and returns, using bothon-chain datasuch as historical transactions and mar-ket volume (Ferdiansyah et al., 2019)and off-chainfactors like social media trends and news sentiment(Abraham et al., 2018; Pang et al., 2019). These stud-ies underscore the effectiveness of integrating diversedata sources for forecasting the volatile dynamics of thecryptocurrency market. Apart from above, Transformer-based models have shown particular promise in this area,with state-of-the-art models like Informer (Zhou et al.,2021), AutoFormer (Wu et al., 2021), PatchTST (Nieet al., 2022), and TimesNet (Wu et al., 2022) furtheradvancing time-series forecasting. Self-Reflective Language Agents The Self-Refineframework introduces an advanced approach for au-tonomous advancement through self-evaluation and iter-ative self-improvement (Madaan et al., 2024). Thisapproach, along with efforts to automatically refineprompts (Pryzant et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2024) and pro-vide automated feedback to enhance reasoning capa-bilities (Paul et al., 2023), marks significant progressin the field. Notably, the \"Reflexion\" framework by(Shinn et al., 2024) revolutionizes the reinforcement oflanguage agents by utilizing linguistic feedback and re-flective text within an episodic memory buffer, divergingfrom traditional weight update methods. These advance-ments highlight the potential for LLMs to learn fromtheir errors and evolve through self-reflection. Despitethese developments, there is still untapped potentialin applying self-reflective language agents to financialdecision-making, particularly in cryptocurrency mar-kets. This work aims to bridge that gap by investigatingthe application of self-reflective mechanisms to enhancefinancial decision-making processes in cryptocurrencytrading.",
  "Conclusion": "We propose the CryptoTrade agent, an innovative ap-proach to cryptocurrency trading that leverages ad-vanced data analysis and LLMs. By integrating bothon-chain and off-chain data, along with a self-reflectivecomponent, the CryptoTrade agent demonstrates asophisticated understanding of market dynamics andachieves relatively high returns in cryptocurrency trad-ing. Our comprehensive experiments comparing theCryptoTrade agent to traditional trading strategies andtime-series models reveal its superior ability to navigatethe volatile cryptocurrency market, consistently achiev-ing relatively high returns on investment under differentmarket conditions over time-series models while notsuperior than traditional trading signals: Buy and Holdand SLMA. This research underscores the significantpotential of LLM-driven strategies in enhancing tradingperformance and sets a new benchmark for cryptocur-rency trading with LLMs.",
  "Limitations": "One limitation of the current CryptoTrade frameworkis the reliance on a relatively limited dataset. To ad-dress this, we plan to enrich the dataset with additionaloff-chain data. Another limitation is the frequency oftrading actions, which is currently set to day-to-day. Weaim to refine this to hour-to-hour or minute-to-minuteintervals to further optimize returns in the cryptocur-rency market. Additionally, we have identified that thelack of fine-tuning for the LLMs using the validationset may be a significant factor behind the LLM-basedagents underperformance compared to traditional trad-ing signals. To improve the reliability of our forecasts,we intend to fine-tune the LLMs with the validation set.",

  "Based on the news articles provided, here is an analysis of the current market trend for Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency:": "1. Ethereum Is Turning Deflationary, But Price Remains Stagnant:- The Ethereum network has burned over half the coins issued since the merge, making it somewhat deflationary.- Despite the burns, ETH prices have not heavily responded, possibly due to less demand at the moment.- The end goal is for the burn rate to outpace the rate of issuing new coins, potentially making ETH truly deflationary.- Ethereum was trading at $1,833.89, down by 0.2% in the last 24 hours. 2. Lido adoption surges with 10,000 new stakers despite Ethereum's price struggles:- More than 10,000 new stakers joined Lido (LDO) in July, indicating continued adoption and growth.- Ethereum's price struggles have impacted Lido's Total Value Locked (TVL), but it remains a leading DeFi protocol.- Predictions suggest staked Ethereum via Lido will surpass eight million in August.- Despite challenges like the Curve Finance exploit, Lido's adoption and staked ETH continue to grow.",

Wisely select the useful information, conclude a clear market trend, pay more attention to long-term trends instead of short-term benefits, and avoid either being too conservative or changing strategies too rapidly. When the trend is upwards, it is profitable to buy ETH, and vice versa. Finally, suggest a 1-decimal float action in the range of . When the trend is bullish and upwards, you need to suggest a positive value to buy ETH. When the trend is bearish and downwards, you need to suggest a negative value to sell ETH. Your action is based on your prediction and confidence on the market trend, where a larger absolute value indicates a higher confidence on your trend prediction. Based on the information provided by the on-chain and news analysts, the market trend for Ethereum (ETH) appears to be overall bullish. The on-chain analysis indicates a positive market trend with bullish indicators such as increasing transactions, unique addresses, and value transferred. The technical indicators also suggest a \"buy\" sentiment, further supporting the bullish trend. Additionally, the news analysis highlights the deflationary nature of Ethereum due to coin burns, which could potentially lead to further price appreciation in the future. Despite some price struggles, the adoption of protocols like Lido continues to grow, indicating a strong interest in Ethereum. Considering the fluctuating but overall bullish market trend, I would recommend buying ETH with a confidence level of -0.8. This action aligns with the positive market sentiment and potential for further growth in the near future.",

Identify key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades. Also assess whether a more aggressive or conservative trading approach is warranted. Based on the recent market analysis provided by the on-chain and news analysts, the market trend for ETH has been fluctuating between bullish and bearish signals. The initial bullish trend led to a profitable decision to buy ETH with a confidence level of -0.7, resulting in a positive daily return. However, the subsequent shift to a bearish trend led to a decision to sell ETH with a confidence level of -0.8, resulting in a negative daily return. The following action of buying ETH with a confidence level of -0.6 also resulted in a negative daily return. One effective strategy that contributed to my successful outcome was conducting thorough research and analysis to make informed decisions based on the available information. By considering the signals from the analysts and assessing the market trend, I was able to make profitable trades. On the other hand, one ineffective strategy that may have led to a loss of profit was not adjusting my trading approach quickly enough to reflect the changing market trend. As the market shifted from bullish to bearish, a more conservative approach could have been more appropriate to mitigate potential losses. Looking ahead, key trends and indicators in the current cryptocurrency market that are likely to influence future trades include overall market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements in the Ethereum network.",
  ": A sample of the Reflection Analyst": "2. SMA (Gencay, 1996): SMA triggers buy or selldecisions based on the assets price relative to itsmoving average. We finetune the SMA period bytesting different window sizes .The optimal period is selected based on the bestperformance on the validation set. 3. SLMA (Wang and Kim, 2018): SLMA involvestwo moving averages of different lengths, withtrading signals generated at their crossover points.We use different combinations of short and longSMA periods, selecting the optimal ones based onvalidation set performance. 4. MACD (Wang and Kim, 2018): A strategy thatuses the MACD indicator to identify potential buyand sell opportunities based on the momentum ofthe asset. The MACD is calculated as the differ-ence between the 12-day EMA and the 26-dayEMA, with a 9-day EMA of the MACD line serv-ing as the signal line. EMA stands for ExponentialMoving Average. It is a type of moving averagethat places a greater weight and significance on themost recent data points. 5. Bollinger Bands (Day et al., 2023): This strat-egy generates trading signals based on price move-ments relative to the middle, lower, and upperBollinger Bands. Bollinger Bands are constructedusing a 20-day SMA and a multiplier (commonlyset to 2) for the standard deviation. We use therecommended period and multiplier settings forthis strategy. 6. LSTM (Ferdiansyah et al., 2019)): This strat-egy involves comparing todays price with thepredicted price for tomorrow to identify poten-tial buying and selling opportunities.We fine-tune the look-back window size using values in and select the parameters thatperform best on the validation set. 7. Informer (Zhou et al., 2021): Informer utilizesan efficient self-attention mechanism to capturedependencies among variables. We adopt the rec-ommended configuration for our experimental set-tings: a dropout rate of 0.05, two encoder layers,one decoder layer, a learning rate of 0.0001, and theAdam optimizer (Yi et al., 2024). The look-backwindow size is selected using the same procedureas for the LSTM. 8. AutoFormer (Wu et al., 2021): AutoFormer intro-duces a decomposition architecture by embeddingthe series decomposition block as an inner opera-tor, allowing for the progressive aggregation of thelong-term trend from intermediate predictions. Weuse the recommended configuration for our exper-imental settings (Yi et al., 2024). The look-backwindow size is selected using the same procedureas for the LSTM. 9. TimesNet (Wu et al., 2022): TimesNet providesa general framework for various time-series fore-casting tasks. We adopt the recommended config-urations for our experimental settings (Wu et al.,2022). The look-back window size is selected us-ing the same procedure as for the LSTM. 10. PatchTST (Nie et al., 2022): PatchTST proposesan effective design for Transformer-based modelsin time series forecasting by introducing two keycomponents: patching and a channel-independentstructure (Yi et al., 2024). The recommended con-figurations are used for our experimental settings.The look-back window size is selected using thesame procedure as for the LSTM.",
