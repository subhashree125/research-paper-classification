  "Abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demon-strated significant potential in handling com-plex reasoning tasks through step-by-step ratio-nale generation. However, recent studies haveraised concerns regarding the hallucination andflaws in their reasoning process. Substantialefforts are being made to improve the reliabil-ity and faithfulness of the generated rationales.Some approaches model reasoning as planning,while others focus on annotating for process su-pervision. Nevertheless, the planning-basedsearch process often results in high latencydue to the frequent assessment of intermediatereasoning states and the extensive explorationspace. Additionally, supervising the reasoningprocess with human annotation is costly andchallenging to scale for LLM training. To ad-dress these issues, in this paper, we propose aframework to learn planning-based reasoningthrough Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)on collected trajectories, which are ranked ac-cording to our synthesized process rewards.Our results on challenging logical reasoningbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness ofour learning framework, showing that our 7Bmodel can surpass the strong counterparts likeGPT-3.5-Turbo. 1",
  "Introduction": "Natural language reasoning has been a fundamentalelement in the advancement of artificial intelligence(AI), with its significant impact on a variety of ap-plications including planning and decision mak-ing (Huang and Chang, 2023). The goal of build-ing AI systems capable of replicating human-likereasoning remains a primary focus within the re-search community. Recent advancements in LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) have showcased theirability to perform complex reasoning tasks, creat-ing sequences of reasoning steps akin to human",

Chen and Shafiq Joty.1Code and trajectory data are released at SparkJiao/dpo-trajectory-reasoning": ": A solution generated by our fine-tuned modelbased on Llama-2-7B-chat (Touvron et al., 2023) for alogical reasoning problem in LogiQA-v2 dataset (Liuet al., 2022). It follow the ReAct (Yao et al., 2023b)format, where each step is marked with a dotted rectan-gle. The content highlighted in green summarizes someopinions in the context, and is omitted. The centralreasoning steps pivotal to arriving at the solution areemphasized in pink. The complete reasoning processcan be found in . thought processes (Wei et al., 2022; Zhou et al.,2023b). Despite these advancements, it is also con-cerning that LLMs are susceptible to generatingmisleading rationales (Bubeck et al., 2023; Lan-ham et al., 2023). Such inaccuracies are particu-larly pronounced in complex reasoning scenarios(Yu et al., 2022; Huang and Chang, 2023; Jiao et al.,2024; Wang et al., 2024), underscoring a significantchallenge.Tremendous efforts have been dedicated to im-prove the reliability and faithfulness of generatedrationales, including knowledge distillation (Hin-ton et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Yue et al., 2023) and self-correction (Shinn et al.,2023). Yet, these approaches predominantly relyon LLMs for identifying errors or providing supe-rior reasoning processes, which could be limitedby their capacity. An alternative is to consider hu-man process supervision (Uesato et al., 2022). Forinstance, Lightman et al. (2023a) propose to traina process reward model (PRM) using step-levelfeedbacks on model-generated solutions, which areannotated by human experts. This enables LLMs torefine their rationales based on the PRMs feedback.While human process supervision has proven effec-tive, it often incurs higher costs compared to merefinal outcome annotation as well as the automaticprocess annotation from a teacher LLM.In addition to the attempts on process supervi-sion, some research efforts have explored search-augmented reasoning for better reasoning trace byassessing the quality of future states. Hao et al.(2023) introduce a general framework of reasoning-as-planning (RAP), where the reasoning processis defined as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).Each step in the MDP comprises a state-action pair,whose particular implementation can vary with dif-ferent application scenarios. illustratesthis process in the context of logical reasoningusing the ReAct (Yao et al., 2023b) format. Ateach step the agent can Think (optionally) and Act,which involves selecting a group of facts and rulesto deduce a new conclusion.2 It can optionallymake an Observation to get an updated view ofthe state. During inference, each state-action pairis assigned a reward, either by an LLM or externalverifier. The planning process is then steered byMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Coulom, 2006)to maximize the expected total cumulative reward(or utility) obtained along the chosen path while ef-fectively narrowing the search space ((a)).Existing RAP frameworks often assume LLMsas the world model being able to assess the qualityof each reasoning step. As a result, the onlineplanning may introduce huge latency and cost dueto frequent assessments of intermediate states andthe large search space. Nevertheless, we find thatthe core idea behind planning-based reasoning isto employ online simulation by taking few forwardsteps to find the optimal path, and the evaluationbecomes more accurate when it has access to realoutcome feedback.In this paper, we explore offline simulation to",
  "Assessment": ": The overall comparison between search-basedinference (a) and our trajectory collection-based offlinetraining (b). In search-based inference, an LLM or anexternal verifier assesses each intermediate state andassigns a scalar value as feedback. The goal of infer-ence is find an optimal reasoning path with maximumexpected utility. In our method, the policy model willfirst explore multiple reasoning paths, with the processrewards calibrated by outcome supervision. And wethen optimize it using DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023) tomaximize the probability of the paths with higher cumu-lative reward. synthesize process supervision.We introduceground-truth outcome supervision that we back-propagate to intermediate states instead of relyingon LLMs for process assessment. We develop asimple and effective strategy based on partial tra-jectory exploration. We first collect some solutionsfrom LLMs as the seed trajectories, and then sam-ple several intermediate reasoning states from themas the non-leaf nodes in planning. After that, theLLMs are asked to retry to complete each of themmultiple times by taking the intermediate statesas new starting points of reasoning. We take thenumber of completions that have reached the cor-rect outcome as the estimate of expected returnsfor training PRM. Finally, we optimize the LLMsto learn a better policy for generating reliable ra-tionales through Direct Preference Optimization(Rafailov et al., 2023), where the contrastive tra-jectory pairs are annotated by the PRM. A generalcomparison between our method and search-basedapproaches is shown in . In a nutshell, ourcontribution can be summarized as follows:",
  "LLMs for Reasoning": "Compared with predicting only the final answer,chain-of-thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) serves asa more suitable way for LLMs considering the ra-tionale will derive more useful information to avoidpotential flaws. Following this, many promptingtechniques are proposed to enrich the generated ra-tionales (Zhou et al., 2023b; Hao et al., 2023). An-other group of work focuses on search-augmentedreasoning, where the decoding process is guided byheuristic search algorithms, like MCTS (Coulom,2006). Basically, each reasoning state is treatedas a node in a tree or graph, and assigned with avalue demonstrating the confidence or expected re-wards when reaching it. And LLMs themselvesoften serve as the evaluator to give feedback tointermediate states (Yao et al., 2023a; Hao et al.,2023).",
  "Improving LLMs via Sparse Feedback": "Since the success of reinforcement learning fromhuman feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017;Ouyang et al., 2022), employing RL algorithms,like PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), to optimizeLLMs from sparse feedback is becoming more im-portant. However, PPO training often demonstratesunstable process and high resource cost. Some al-ternative variants are then proposed, like rejectionsampling (Bai et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023)and direct preference modeling (DPO) (Rafailovet al., 2023). Towards the different types of feed-back, Lightman et al. (2023b) and Uesato et al.(2022) propose process supervision to assess theintermediate reasoning steps. Nevertheless, collect-ing step-wise feedback from human experts is oftentime-consuming and expensive. In this paper, wepropose a simple heuristic approach to estimate theprocess rewards of intermediate states.OurworkisconcurrenttoMATH-Shepherd (Wang et al., 2023).We sharesimilar methodology for process rewards estima-tion, but we have focused on different reasoning",

Besides,a reward model rt = r(at, st) R is employed toassess the feasibility and desirability of each state-action pair. In this paper, we focus on the taskswith annotated final labels, where the agent willreceive a positive reward when it finally reaches acorrect answer:",
  "Estimate Process Rewards via OfflineSimulation": "One of the main issues with LLMs is that theytend to hallucinate (Huang et al., 2023). A com-mon illusion with multi-step reasoning is that thederived conclusion may be correct but the LLMsmight reach there through unreasonable deduction Context:A college plans to select several of the six teachers from Mr. Liu, Mr. Zhang, Mr. Wang, Mr. Ma, Mr. Niuand Mr. Zhou to visit abroad. Due to , the selection shall meet the following conditions: (1) Mr. Liu is the reserve discipline leader of the college, This time we have to send out. (2) if we choose Mr. Liu, we should also choose Mr. Zhou, but we can't choose Mr. Zhang. (3) only if Mr. Niu can't choose, at least one of Mr. Wang and Mr. Ma can choose. (4) if we don't choose Mr. Wang, we don't choose Mr. Zhou either.Question: If the above statement is true, which of the followings must be true?Options:A. Mr. Niu didn't choose, but Mr. Zhou did.B. Mr. Liu was chose, but Mr. Ma didn't.C. Mr. Wang and Mr. Ma were chosen.D. Neither Mr. Wang nor Mr. Niu was elected.",
  "Policy Model !": "Thought 1: Who must be chosen or who must not be chosen according to the context by one-step reasoning?Action 1: Take condition (1).Observation 1: Mr. Liu must be chosen.Thought 2: Based on Observation 1, who must be chosen or who must not be chosen one step further?Action 2: Take condition (2).Observation 2: Mr. Zhou must be chosen, but Mr. Zhang must not be chosen. Observation 13: According to condition (4), if Mr. Wang was not chosen, Mr. Zhou must not be chosen. So Mr. Zhou was not chosen. This is contradictory to observation 2. So Option D is not true.Action 14: Finish[The answer is A.]",
  "where , (#), - (#)": ": The overall framework of our approach. (1) Collect samples with full solution trajectories. (2) Sampleintermediate reasoning states from the dataset, and ask the policy model to continuously explore based on theintermediate states. After the completed trajectory reaching the termination, we can collect the raw rewardsaccording to the outcome supervision as the approximation of expected returns for the intermediate reasoning states.(3) A process reward model is learned from the raw rewards to alleviate the dataset noise and reduce simulation cost.(4) Collect more full trajectories and annotate them with the trained process reward model. (5) Optimize the policymodel on the pairwise trajectory dataset assessed by our synthesised process rewards. processes. To address this, we aim at introduc-ing process supervision (Lightman et al., 2023a),which, however, is hard to obtain in most reason-ing cases. We propose a simulation based methodto estimate the expected value by starting from anintermediate point in a trajectory and exploringthe received rewards after reaching the terminalstates. The idea is based on a common observationthat if an intermediate reasoning state can reachthe correct answer more frequently, it has higherprobability to demonstrate some important factsor evidences towards the conclusion. Specifically,given an input x and an intermediate reasoning stept, we randomly sample K trajectories starting fromeither action at or state st. Taking at as example,the estimated expected value for it is formulated as:",
  "Synthesized Process Reward Model": "After collecting enough trajectories as well as theestimated expected values of intermediate steps,we can train a PRM to assign a reward to each in-termediate state/action, following Lightman et al.(2023b). The motivation behind training a processreward model instead of using the collected valuesas the rewards includes: (1) If we assess each inter-mediate step to estimate the value of the completetrajectory by only heuristic simulation, similar tothe weakness of MCTS, the time consumption andcost will be severe. (2) The simulation based es-timation will also introduce noise, since the com-pletion quality highly depends on the fundamentalcapability of the initial policy model. As a result,employing an extra reward model to approximatethe expected values can be more robust and effi-cient than heuristic algorithms.Specifically, following the method in .2",

This is to avoid that the potentialhallucinated rationales generated by the originalLLMs can affect the estimation of process rewards.Once we have the clear definition of the trajec-tory level reward based on the PRM, the policymodel can be optimized via reinforcement learning.Considering the instability of PPO (Schulman et al.,2017) training, we choose the algorithm of DirectPreference Optimization (DPO) instead.",
  "Direct Preference Optimization": "In this section,we will first introduce thevanilla DPO approach with only outcome su-pervision, which also servers as an strong base-line method. Specifically, given an original datasample (x(i), y(i)), and a group of trajectoriesT (i) = { (i)0 , (i)1 , , (i)n } sampled from the pol-icy model taking x(i) as input, we can simply con-struct a preference dataset:",

Sincewe have already defined a trajectory-level reward inEquation 7 involving the process rewards, we canfurther consider the pair-wise relationship amongthose trajectories with correct predictions:",
  "Datasets": "In this paper, we mainly focus on logical reason-ing and mathematical reasoning. For logical rea-soning, we choose ReClor (Yu et al., 2020) andLogiQA-v2 (Liu et al., 2022) for evaluation, whichare two challenging and widely used logical rea-soning benchmarks. Both datasets are formulatedas multiple choice question answering and thestatistics of the two datasets are shown in .For mathematical reasoning, we have employedthe test sets of GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) andMATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) for evaluation.",
  "Overall Results on Logical Reasoning": "The results on logical reasoning benchmarks areshown in , from where we can concludethat (1) DPO serves as a strong baseline, signifi-cantly boosting the performance of the SFT modeland outperforming the other baselines. Notably,the DPO-fine-tuned model on LogiQA-v2 recordsan in-domain improvement of 7.0%, and an 7.6% improvement on the ReClor dataset. The one fine-tuned on ReClor also demonstrates 2.5% in-domainand 3.0% out-of-domain improvements, respec-tively. Besides, on LogiQA-v2, Llama2-7B-DPOcan already surpass the other rejection samplingbased baselines with large margins, like RFT andReST-EM. This indicates DPOs efficacy in opti-mizing the policy model using outcome supervisionalone. (2) pDPO surpasses the vanilla DPO thatrelies solely on outcome supervision. For instance,by fine-tuning on LogiQA-v2, pDPO achieves abso-lute improvements of 2.4% and 1.3% on LogiQA-v2 and ReClor, respectively. Through training onReClor, pDPO also achieves 2.2% absolute in-domain improvements. Besides, pDPO trainedon LogiQA-v2 outperforms the strong foundationLLMs including Mixtral and GPT-3.5 Turbo, sug-gesting the superiority of our synthesized processsupervision. (4) The LogiQA-v2 dataset emergesas a more effective tool for learning explicit logi-cal reasoning processes compared to ReClor. Asshown in the Table, by fine-tuning on LogiQA-v2, the generalization performance of pDPO onReClor dataset is even better than the in-domainfine-tuned models. After diving into the dataset de-tails, we find that LogiQA-v2 comprises multiplecomplex logical reasoning abilities, like categori-cal reasoning and sufficient reasoning, while quitea few questions in ReClor require only one-stepreasoning to justify the entailment of each option.",
  "Improvements by Iterative Training": "We also performed iterative training by takingLlama2-7B-pDPO trained on LogiQA-v2 as thenew base model and fine-tuning it on the newly self-sampled solutions. In addition to DPO and pDPO,we have also explored the RL based approaches,including PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) and GroupRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al.,2024). For fair comparison with pDPO, PPO andGRPO also include both the process rewards fromour PRM, and the outcome rewards derived fromthe ground-truth labels. The implementation detailscan be found in Appendix A.From , we observe that all four ap-proaches demonstrate consistent in-domain im-provements. Notably, the pDPO approach, whichutilizes synthesized process supervision, surpassesthe conventional process PPO method. This im-provement may be attributed to the slightly noisynature of the synthesized process rewards, whichcomplicates the task for the critic model within the",

Conversely, GRPO achieves a significantperformance edge over PPO by sampling multiplesolutions for the same query and calculating advan-tages using the group-averaged rewards as baseline.Furthermore, it is important to highlight that DPO-based methods significantly reduce training costs,completing the training process in under 16 hourson four NVIDIA H100 GPUs, whereas PPO andGRPO require over 40 hours on the same hardware.",
  "Results on Mathematical Reasoning": "In addition to logical reasoning, we also conductedexperiments on mathematical reasoning to verifythe effectiveness of our proposed approach, andthe results are shown in . Specifically, werandomly sampled a subset of MetaMath (Yu et al.,2023) as the training set containing 25,000 ques-tions for Gemma-2B training. From the table wecan conclude that, on GSM8K, the synthesizedprocess rewards also effectively enhance the math-ematical reasoning capabilities. Moreover, by em-ploying DPO and pDPO, our models with 2B pa-rameters can outperform Gemma-7B-Instruct withsignificant improvements.Despite our efforts, enhancing Gemma-2B-DPOs performance on the MATH dataset hasproven challenging, possibly due to the basemodels limited capability on MATH, which in-troduces noise when estimating expected returnsduring the simulation stage. Consequently, we ex-panded our experiments to include DeepSeekMath-7B-Instruct (Shao et al., 2024), which is pre-trainedon large high-quality math-related corpus. We cu-rated another subset from MetaMath for DeepSeek-Math training, which contains 55,000 questionsaugmented from the MATH training dataset. Asdepicted in the table, the results reveal that pDPO : The accuracy of DPO, pDPO and SFT mod-els on the validation set (left) and test set (right) ofLogiQA-v2, respectively, taking different ratio of anno-tated questions.also surpasses DPO in performance by employingbetter foundation model.",
  "Reliance on Annotations of OutcomeSupervision": "Although our proposed reward synthesis approachhave avoided the direct annotation of process su-pervision, the outcome supervision still plays animportant role for back-propagating the confidenceto intermediate reasoning steps. In order to studythe effect of outcome supervision scale to final per-formance, we randomly construct the sub-datasetscontaining 40%, 60%, and 80% questions in theoriginal dataset to evaluate the fine-tuned perfor-mance. The results are plotted in .From the figure we can observe that (1) pDPOconsistently outperform DPO across all datasetsplits with different sizes by significant margins,demonstrating the effectiveness of the synthesizedprocess supervision. (2) With only 40% annota-tions containing 3,234 questions in total, processsupervision can outperform the base SFT modelwith significant improvements, which also verifiesthe significance by providing sparse feedback forcontinuous improvements. (3) Besides, we findthat pDPO with only 40% outcome annotationscan achieve comparable performance on the testset with DPO, i.e., 53.5 v.s. 53.9. Consideringthat we have only used 10% outcome annotationsfor training the process reward model, the resultscan definitely emphasize the data efficiency of ourapproach.",

In order to avoid the bias caused byprediction errors of the two models, we first find asubset of questions where both the solutions givenby the two models lead to the correct answer. Af-ter that, we randomly sampled 261 questions fromthe subset for evaluation. The results are shownin . From all the three aspects, pDPO per-forms much better than vanilla DPO without pro-cess reward. Around 67.8% solutions of pDPO aredeemed to have higher overall quality. Besides, forthe most important view, among 52.5% questions,pDPO can generate more reasonable rationales. Wecan also find that nearly 60% responses by pDPOare more compact, suggesting that the process su-pervision can help make the rationale more briefbut accurate.",
  "In this section, we have visualized the predictedstep-wise rewards on the training set of LogiQA-v2, where the solutions are sampled from the SFT": "model. In , we have visualized three dif-ferent kinds of rewards: (1) the averaged step-wiserewards before the softmax operation, i.e., the prob-ability (left); (2) the accumulated rewards by pro-duction (medium); and (3) the averaged logits ofeach step from the last layer of the reward model(right). When diving into the logits without nor-malization, we can find that the rewards maintainrelatively stable at around the first 15 steps, thendecrease sharply. This may be caused by the imbal-anced amount of solutions with different reasoningsteps, which makes the reward model less confidenton the longer steps. On the other hand, the accu-mulated probability based rewards keep decreasingwith longer reasoning process, which can be use-ful to avoid redundant solutions by penalizing theextremely longer ones.",
  "Case Study": "In this section, we conduct a case study to intu-itively demonstrate the augmentation bought byprocess-supervised DPO. As shown in , thevanila DPO induced model shows two weaknesses:(1) the intermediate reasoning step is wrong, whichis highlighted in red. And (2) the solution is re-dundant, like Action 2 and Action 5 to Observation8. On the contrary, process-supervised DPO notonly well illustrates the flaw in Qs response (Ob-servation 3), but also eliminate the meaninglesscontent, which introduce less noise to make correctprediction.",
  "Conclusion": "In this paper, we propose a novel idea to trans-form reasoning-as-planning as a learning problemto avoid the latency induced by online search. In-spired by MCTS, we developed a offline simulationapproach to estimate the expected value of inter-mediate reasoning steps. After that, we use thecollected expected value dataset to fit a process re-ward model and annotate the full trajectories with sequence-level rewards. Finally, the policy modelis optimized using direct preference optimization.The experimental results on logical and mathemati-cal reasoning demonstrate the effectiveness of ourproposed method. Towards the future work, wehope to explore the synthesised process reward esti-mated by weak-supervision from different aspectsto further alleviate the reliance on human annota-tions and enable consistent self-improvement.",

  "ABaseline": "Foundational LLMsWe have selected thestrong LLMs without task-specific fine-tuning asbaselines, including Llama-2-70B-chat (Touvronet al., 2023), Mixtral-MoE-87B-Instruct (Jiangetal.,2024),GPT-3.5-TurboandGPT-4-Turbo (OpenAI, 2023). Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)We first sam-ple some responses from larger LLMs follow-ing the ReAct format for knowledge distillationsince we cannot directly fine-tune them due tothe resource limitation.After that, we can ob-tain the smaller LLMs with considerable rea-soning capability through supervised fine-tuning(SFT). These models serve as baselines and thefoundation models for DPO training.Specifi-cally, we choose Llama-2-7B-chat and Gemma-2B-Instruct (Gemma Team, 2024) for SFT. Outcome-based Preference OptimizationWeinclude the model with only outcome supervisionas baseline to discuss the effectiveness of our syn-thesised process reward. For fair comparison, DPOimplicitly model the outcome rewards followingEquation 8. We also involve IPO as baseline. Thetraining dataset is Do as mentioned in .5. Rejection Sampling-based ApproachWe alsoinclude the rejection sampling based approaches,i.e., Rejection sampling based Fine-tuning (Yuanet al., 2023), and ReST-EM (Singh et al., 2023).Both approaches use outcome annotations to fil-ter the self-sampled solutions. The difference isthat RFT uses the correct solutions to augment theoriginal SFT dataset, while ReST-EM employs thesampled dataset to train the original model fromscratch during each iteration. Besides, for RFT, weincludes two variants: (1) RFT-outcome uses onlythe outcome annotation to filter solutions; and (2)RFT-outcome & PRM-top-k follows RFT-outcomeand uses our trained PRM to rank the kept solu-tions. Only the top-k ranked solutions will be keptand augment the orinal training set. For ReST-EM,we have conducted two iterations since there isalready performance decreasing observed in thesecond round. Reinforce LearningIn the experiments of it-erative training, we include two reinforce learn-ing algorithms, PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) andGRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the comparison ofprocess-based DPO. Both algorithms employ two kinds of rewards, i.e., the outcome reward and theprocess rewards. For each solution (trajectory) sam-pled from the policy model, we assign it with 1 if itcan induce the correct answer, otherwise we assignit with 0 as the outcome reward. Besides, for eachreasoning step, the predicted logits by our trainedPRM is treated as the process rewards. One differ-ence should be noted is that, in pDPO training, weutilize the probability from the PRM as the processreward following Lightman et al. (2023a), while forRL training, we use the logits without normaliza-tion from the last layer of PRM, to avoid extremelonger solutions introduced by accumulating thenon-positive step rewards.",
  "BEvaluation Details": "In order to simplify the evaluation procedure, forthe models without task-specific fine-tuning, weuse 1-shot prompt of ReAct, which is the same asthat we used for collecting data, to induce the mod-els to generate reasonable solutions. For modelsafter fine-tuning, we remove the 1-shot demonstra-tion because we find it can lead to higher results.Due to limitation of budget, for GPT-4-Turbo, weonly evaluate the first 250 questions in the test setof LogiQA-v2.Besides, as mentioned in .3, we havedesigned several rules to both filter the solutionsunsatisfying the ReAct format and calculate theaccuracy.

ForGemma-2B, we sample solutions of MetaMathfrom Qwen-72B-chat (Bai et al., 2023).All teacher models are prompted with exactlyone example. The prompt used for LogiQA-v2 andReClor is shown in . And the one used forMetaMath follows RAP (Hao et al., 2023)4. Forall datasets, we sample 10 solutions regarding eachquestion with temperature fixed as 0.7. Besides,for ReClor dataset, we remove all solutions withless than 8 reasoning steps because they omit thedetailed reasoning process and can lead to inferiorsolutions for DPO based approach.",

All experiments, expept thoseusing RL algorithms, are repeated for 3 timeswith different random seeds and the average resultsare reported to reduce the influence of randomness.We run RL-based approaches for only once due toresource limitation.",
  "DCompared with MATH-Shepherd": "We work concurrently with Math-Shepherd (Wanget al., 2023), which also comprises similar offlinesimulation method to synthesize the process su-pervision. Differently, they mainly evaluate theapproach on mathematical reasoning through veri-fication, where the candidate solutions are rankedaccording to the rewards from the learned PRM,or employing it for PPO training, while we focuson logical reasoning and demonstrate the effec-tiveness of the synthesized process supervision viaconstructing the preference dataset under the guid-ance of the PRM. The dataset is further used forDPO training, which, though cannot really surpassGRPO, often demonstrates less resource require-ments and more stable learning process.",
  "EEffect of Different Reward Margins": "In Equation 9, we have involved a hyper-parameter to control the confidence interval between dif-ferent sample pairs both reaching the correct an-swer to construct the process-supervised prefer-ence dataset. Naturally, there are several aspectsof trade-off to considering the choices of . with higher value can improve the ratio of true pos-itive pairs in the constructed dataset. Yet, highconfidence intervals will also reduce the number of training data and probability to include morehard negative samples. For example, as shown in, = 0.7 introduces only 10% extra pref-erence pairs and lead to less significant improve-ments compared with the case where = 0.5. Onthe other hand, lower value of can include bothmore hard negative and false positive pairs. Fromthe table we find that = 0.3 has has introducedmore than 25% process-supervised pairs, but theperformance is even worse than the vanilla DPOapproach, where only outcome-based preferencespairs are employed.
