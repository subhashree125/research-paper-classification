  "Abstract": "Solidarity is a crucial concept to understandsocial relations in societies. In this paper, weexplore fine-grained solidarity frames to studysolidarity towards women and migrants in Ger-man parliamentary debates between 1867 and2022. Using 2,864 manually annotated textsnippets (with a cost exceeding 18k Euro), weevaluate large language models (LLMs) likeLlama 3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. We find thatGPT-4 outperforms other LLMs, approachinghuman annotation quality. Using GPT-4, weautomatically annotate more than 18k furtherinstances (with a cost of around 500 Euro)across 155 years and find that solidarity withmigrants outweighs anti-solidarity but that fre-quencies and solidarity types shift over time.Most importantly, group-based notions of (anti-)solidarity fade in favor of compassionate soli-darity, focusing on the vulnerability of migrantgroups, and exchange-based anti-solidarity, fo-cusing on the lack of (economic) contribution.Our study highlights the interplay of histori-cal events, socio-economic needs, and politi-cal ideologies in shaping migration discourseand social cohesion. We also show that power-ful LLMs, if carefully prompted, can be cost-effective alternatives to human annotation forhard social scientific tasks.",
  "Introduction": "Solidarity is a crucial concept for understandinghow societies achieve and maintain stability andcohesion (Reynolds, 2014), and it plays a criticalrole in shaping policies (Laitinen and Pessi, 2014).Traditionally, solidarity relied on common identityand reciprocity, potentially excluding out-groupslike migrants (Hopman and Knijn, 2022) and re-inforcing social boundaries and hierarchies (An-thias, 2014). However, growing diversity and in-creasing socio-economic, political, religious, andcultural complexities of modern societies (Kym-licka, 2020) call such traditional forms of solidar-ity into question. Simultaneously, recent populist Group-based Exchange- based",

This text expresses...",
  "None": ": Annotation scheme based on Thijssen (2012).The scheme categorizes statements into solidarity, anti-solidarity, mixed, and none (high-level). At the fine-grained level, solidarity and anti-solidarity are furtherdivided into group-based, exchange-based, compassion-ate, and empathic subtypes. movements challenge policies that support equality,such as equal opportunity or reproductive rights ofwomen (Inglehart and Norris, 2016). These evolv-ing complexities motivate a deeper and broaderstudy of social solidarity, namely (i) a fine-grainedexploration of different forms of social solidarityto reflect its multifaceted nature (Oosterlynck andBouchaute, 2013), and (ii) a broader historical anal-ysis to trace its evolution from the 19th century totoday (Banting and Kymlicka, 2017). In this work,we contribute to such a systematic study of solidar-ity by tracing fine-grained notions of solidarity andanti-solidarity towards two target groups, womenand migrants, in political speech, namely Germanparliamentary debates from 1867 to 2022 (Walteret al., 2021). We employ the social solidarity frame-work by Thijssen (2012) that incorporates rational(group-based and exchange-based) and emotive",
  "(1) Compassionate solidaritytowards women(June 29, 1961)": "In connection with 1708 BGB, the Bundestag has set the age of 18 as the limit forthe obligation to provide maintenance. In the transitional provisions, this stipulationhas been repealed for those who had already reached the age of 16 on January 1,1962. My faction finds this regulation unfair, as it would exempt significant groups ofpeople from this maintenance obligation. Especially women who have made greatefforts to send their children to higher education, for example, would have tobear these costs alone. [...]",
  "(2) Exchange-basedanti-solidarity towards migrants(Apr. 19, 2018)": "[...] Let me also add: Migration is not necessarily successful you always actas if that is great it can fail, and it fails in particular when the immigrantsqualifications are low. In 2013, before the so-called refugee wave, 40 percent ofimmigrants from non-EU countries had no qualifications. Since the wave of refugees,stabbings have increased by 20 percent, and we have imported anti-Semitism in thecountry. Does this make for an outstandingly successful migration?",
  "(3) Mixed stance towardsmigrants(Feb. 2, 1982)": "[...] We must accept that in a few years we will again need a higher number offoreign workers in the Federal Republic, as Mr. Urbaniak hinted earlier. In reality,therefore, we must commit to effective integration, which admittedly requires[...] that there can be no exceptions, no alternative, regarding the recruitmentstop and the prevention of illegal immigration. [...] (4) None case (women)(June 17, 2015)[...] We want to be free people! There is probably no better phrase to open todaysdebate here in the German Bundestag about the popular uprising of 1953. [...] Weremember women and men who, 62 years ago, showed great courage becausethey wanted to change the course of their countrys development and their ownlives, because they wanted to be free people. : Example sentences from our dataset showing (anti-)solidarity towards women/migrants. Bold text is themain sentence, the other sentences are for context. Original German texts, as well as examples of mixed stance andnone, are available in in the Appendix. (compassionate and empathic) elements of solidar-ity (refer to and for more detailson the typology). We focus on migrants, central forsolidarity discourse in European and German poli-tics (Thrnhardt, 1993; Faist, 1994; Frhlich, 2023;Lehr, 2015), and women as an oppressed majorityhistorically marginalized from public life (Calloni,2020). As manual annotation of (anti-)solidarityconcepts in all parliamentary proceedings over this155-year period using traditional sociological meth-ods is practically infeasible, we explore the use oflanguage models for this complex task. In par-ticular, we assess the efficacy of BERT, Llama-3,GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, to detect expressions of var-ious (anti-)solidarity types in parliamentary texts,aiming to identify the best performing model forour large-scale analysis. From an NLP perspective,this task is semantically and pragmatically chal-lenging because, (i) expressions of (anti-)solidarityare often implied rather than explicitly stated in thetext and their meaning is affected by the politicaland historical context in which they are made (seethe examples in ; Sravanthi et al., 2024); (ii)German data, especially evolving German languageover 155 years, is under-represented in commontraining data sets for LLMs, which may affect per-formance (Ahuja et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024); and (iii) LLMs might struggle with an-notating complex sociological concepts, achievinglower quality and reliability compared to humanannotators (Wang et al., 2021; Ding et al., 2022;Zhu et al., 2023; Pangakis et al., 2023).Our contributions are: (i) We provide a humanannotated training & evaluation dataset of 2,864text snippets, which required 40+ hours weeklyfrom 4-5 annotators over nine months, totaling aninvestment of approximately 18k Euro; (ii) we con-duct a comparative analysis of LLMs on a complexsociological task in which pre-trained languagemodels (esp. GPT-4) outperform an open-sourcemodel Llama-3-70B-Instruct, as well as modelsfine-tuned for this task (BERT, GPT-3.5 fine tuned);(iii) we provide fine-grained insights into solidaritydiscourse concerning migrants in Germany in thelast 155 years across different political parties.",

(2021) consider solidarity in Eu-ropean social media discourse around COVID-19.Eger et al. (2022) extend this work by examininghow design choices, like keyword selection andlanguage, affect assessments of solidarity changesover time.

  "Data": "We obtain data from two sources: (i) Open Data,covering Bundestag (en.: federal diet) protocolsfrom 1949 until today; and (ii) Reichstagspro-tokolle covering Reichstag (en.: imperial diet) pro-tocols until 1945.1 We use the OCR-scanned ver-sion from Walter et al. (2021). Links to data, mod-els, etc. used are in Appendix D. For the Reichstagdata, we apply preprocessing steps similar to Walteret al. (2021) (e.g., removal of OCR artifacts), butkeep German umlauts, capitalization, and punctua-tion. We automatically split the data into individualsittings and collect metadata like the date, periodand number of each sitting, which we manuallycheck and correct. Additionally, we removed in-terjections and split the text into sentences usingNLTK (Bird et al., 2009), resulting in 19.1M sen-tences. We release this dataset of plenary protocolsfrom German political debates (DeuParl) consistingof 9,923 sittings from 1867 to 2022 on GitHub.2 To select keywords, we (i) train a Word2Vecmodel (Mikolov et al., 2013) on our dataset to iden-tify words with vector representations similar toMigrant (en.: migrant) and Frau (en.: woman); (ii)manually expand this list with intuitively relevantterms; (iii) from both lists, we filter for those which",

  "Annotation task design": "For the manual annotation, we take the target sen-tence and three preceding and following sentencesfor context into account. We first select a high-levelcategory (solidarity, anti-solidarity, mixed, none).Solidarity or anti-solidarity cases are then furtherdistinguished into frames as defined by Thijssenand Verheyen (2022): group-based, compassionate,exchange-based, and empathic. We describe eachof the included variables below. High-level categories.Based on Lahusen andGrasso (2018) and Ils et al. (2021), we define sol-idarity as willingness to share resources, directlyor indirectly, or support for target groups, and anti-solidarity as statements restricting resources, show-ing unwillingness to support, or implying exclusionof these groups. Texts with both supporting and op-posing expressions are labeled mixed, while neutralor unrelated texts are labeled none. Group-based solidarityis coded for texts em-phasizing shared identity and common goalsamong group members, whereas group-based anti-solidarity emphasizes out-group exclusion basedon perceived differences. Compassionate solidarityis coded for texts sup-porting marginalized groups, emphasizing theirneed for protection, while compassionate anti-solidarity dismisses these groups by consideringthem already in a good position, minimizing theirneed support or protection. Exchange-based solidarityis coded when textshighlight the economic contributions of exchangepartners and potential rewards or further contribu-tions. Conversely, exchange-based anti-solidaritycalls for penalizing groups perceived as receivingmore than they contribute. Empathic solidarityis coded when a speakerexpresses respect for individual differences, see-ing social diversity as beneficial, while empathicanti-solidarity arises when differences are used asgrounds for exclusion or neglect.Annotation involved elaborate explanations,with identification of (anti-)solidarity resources and highlighting expressions of (anti-)solidarity, aswell as self- (speakers own viewpoint) and other-position (addressing or criticizing others view-points).

  "(b) Annotators vs. Model": ": a shows the confusion matrix betweenhuman annotators; b shows agreement betweenthe best model and human annotators on a test set fromone of the three splits. The former is aggregated overall pairwise comparisons of annotators, thus the matrixis symmetric. While initial agreement levels were low, by thetime annotators began working independently, theyachieved a pairwise agreement with a CohensKappa of 0.42 on a fine-grained level and 0.62on a high level. We observe three main disagree-ment issues in annotation: misclassification of nonecases, confusion between mixed stance and anti-solidarity, and overlap within solidarity and anti-solidarity subtypes (see in the Appendix).This confusion is often due to overlapping charac-teristics or the presence of multiple subtypes withinthe text; moreover, this annotation task is inherentlysubjective, which can lead to differing interpreta-tions. This is further evidenced by our averageagreement scores. in the Appendix pro-vides examples of annotator divergence, explain-ing why multiple labels could be correct, whichgives insight into more difficult instances. How-ever, there was almost no confusion between sol-idarity and anti-solidarity. We note less stabilityin annotator agreement before 1930, stabilizing insubsequent years (see a in the Appendix).Although these variations can stem from the com-plexities of historical language and diverse interpre-tations of past events, they might also stem fromthe unbalanced distribution of human annotateddata over the decades (see ). Our dataset comprises 2864 annotated instances,1437 for migrants and 1427 for women. We notethat anti-solidarity accounts for 13.5% of instances,being more common among migrants (12.1%) thanwomen (1.4%) (see a in the Appendix). 368instances in our dataset (referred to as curated)were reviewed by a social science expert to providea reliable comparison benchmark for evaluation ofour models. Other consensus mechanisms for the fi-nal labels in the human-annotated dataset, and theirdistribution are shown in b in the Appendix.",

Most importantly, GPT-4 leadsin F1 scores across categories, effectively identi-fying both solidarity and anti-solidarity (0.65 forwomen and 0.87 for migrants in zero-shot settings,see in the Appendix). However, it scoreslowest in the mixed stance category, indicatingchallenges with more complex and ambiguous in-stances. Llama-3, on the other hand, outperformsGPT-4 in this category for women and also leads inthe none category for migrants by better identify-ing contradicting and subtle cues, likely benefitingfrom the two-step classification approach.Conversely, BERT achieves lower F1 scoresacross all categories, performing comparably to theGPT-3.5 versions on high-level tasks but strugglingwith fine-grained tasks and ambivalent categorieslike mixed stance, likely due to challenges fromunderrepresented labels such as anti-solidarity cat-egories for women, even after over-sampling (see, as well as a in the Appendix).",

There is also confusion betweencompassionate and empathic solidarity, where themodel sometimes misinterprets empathic as merelyrelating to the term empathy, overlooking the fullcategory definition, which involves respecting di-versity, as in example 4 in .",
  "In this section, we analyze how the solidarity dis-course in the German parliament developed over155 years, using automatic, fine-grained annota-": "tions from the best-performing model, GPT-4 zero-shot. However, due to cost constraints, we limit theannotations to a) data concerning migrants, i.e., thetarget group for which our models achieved higherscores and b) a sample of 18,300 instances fromthe overall 58k instances concerning migrants. Wedraw the sample proportionally for the time spansin the original data. This selection includes allrecords with political party information (see Ap-pendix B for details on political parties data ex-traction and list of parties included in the analysis).The cost of this automatic annotation was around500 Euro. How does (anti-)solidarity change over time?As shown in b, throughout the periodsanalyzed, solidarity consistently surpasses anti-solidarity. From 1880 to 1910, solidarity increasedfrom under 20% to 30%, driven by discussionsabout Eastern and Central European foreign work-ers rights in the context of industrialization andlocal demographic shifts (Schnwlder, 1999).Following the NS regime, solidarity surgesabove 50%, aligning with the influx of Vertriebene(en.: expellees), who were generally viewed pos-itively in parliamentary debates (Frhlich, 2023),as well as the arrival of Gastarbeiter (en.: guestworkers) from the Mediterranean (Stalker, 2000).The highest solidarity and low anti-solidarity in1940s reflect limited discussions (due to sparse dataduring this period) skewed towards solidarity, pri-marily focusing on expellees.Anti-solidarity towards migrants initially rosefrom about 5% to over 15% between 1870 and1890, remaining stable until 1920, likely due tofears of Polonization from the influx of Polishworkers, leading to restrictive policies against per-ceived threats to German identity (Triadafilopoulos,2004). From 1960, anti-solidarity resurged withrising anti-migrant sentiments linked to labor mi-gration in the 1960s and 1970s, right-wing oppo-sition to liberal asylum laws in the 1990s (Faist,",

Greyshaded areas from 1933 to 1949 indicate sparse data during the NS dictatorship and post-war period. 1994), and the influx of refugees due to the Syrianwar around 2015 with the subsequent rise of theextreme right-wing AfD party (Hertner, 2022). By2022, solidarity stabilizes at around 40%, whileanti-solidarity has risen to above 20%. We alsonote a relative decrease in solidarity compared toanti-solidarity, as shown in in the Appendix,which illustrates this shift by subtracting the per-centage of anti-solidarity from that of solidarity. How have (anti-)solidarity frames evolved overtime?In a, for solidarity (left), it is ev-ident that group-based solidarity (i.e., emphasison shared national identity and integration) wasdominant until the 1990s, peaking to over 50% in1870 with the founding of the German empire. Itdrops to below 20% by 1880, surges back above50% in 1970, and then declines to below 30% by2020. These trends align with periods of strongGerman nationalism (around 1870 and pre-WorldWar II) and the influx of expellees in the 1950sand 1960s. For anti-solidarity (right), trends showgroup-based anti-solidarity dominant before WWII,peaking from 70% to over 90%, then declining tobelow 60% post-war, reflecting a decline in op-position to migration based on national identityin parliamentary debates after the NS era. Instead,anti-solidarity arguments shifted to exchange-basedanti-solidarity (from below 10% to above 40% afterWorld War II), i.e. arguments that migrants are notproviding adequate economic contributions. Nei-ther compassionate nor empathic anti-solidarity arefrequent at any time. By 2022, group-based soli-darity declines, giving way to compassionate soli-darity, which rose to above 40%.",
  "How are solidarity and anti-solidarity framesrepresented across political parties?Our anal-": "ysis covers the distribution of (anti-)solidarityframes across parties from 1865 to 2022. It shouldbe noted that we assess the data without regardto the specific emergence dates of political parties(e.g., AfD established in 2013 versus SPD in 1863).Data subdivision by the speakers party showsthat all parties, except for the far-right AfD, mainlyexhibit solidarity towards migrants ( in theAppendix, left). Compassionate and group-basedsolidarity are prevalent, with left-leaning parties(Linke, Grne) showing higher levels of compas-sionate and empathic solidarity compared to themore exchange-focused solidarity of centrist par-ties (SPD, FDP, CDU/CSU). Conversely, while theright-wing parties, including CDU/CSU, also en-gage in anti-solidarity rhetoric, it is AfD that pre-dominantly holds such stances, focusing mainlyon exchange-based anti-solidarity that suggests mi-grants contribute less (see in the Appendix,right). This distribution mirrors findings in Flan-ders, Belgium, where radical rightists discoursepredominantly focuses on group-based frames;greens and social democrats emphasize compas-sionate solidarity, liberals prefer exchange-basedapproaches, and both greens and liberals advocatefor empathic solidarity, highlighting a polariza-tion of partisan discourse (Thijssen and Verheyen,2022).",
  "Concluding remarks": "This study set out to i) provide a high-qualitydataset of (anti-)solidarity annotations in Germanparliamentary debates, ii) from an NLP perspec-tive, evaluate the ability of LLMs to assist in large-scale social and political analyses over extendedperiods, and iii) from a CSS perspective, uncoverlong-term shifts in solidarity trends in Germany, laying groundwork for future sociological studies.Concerning i), we invested 1000+ annotationhours and 18k Euro to provide a data set of 2,864manually annotated text snippets following the so-ciological framework of Thijssen (2012).Regarding ii), our findings indicate that GPT-4outperforms other models (Llama-3-70B, GPT-3.5base, fine-tuned, and BERT) in reproducing humanannotations. While other models demonstrate pro-ficiency in identifying high-level categories, theyexhibit limitations in handling more nuanced cat-egories, specific to sociological theory. GPT-4,though challenged by ambiguity, handles complextasks even in a zero-shot setting.Contrary to previous research in CSS that sug-gested smaller fine-tuned models like BERT per-formed well (Choi et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023),our study finds that larger models are more ef-fective our hard CSS task, possibly due to thecarefully designed prompts based on human ex-pertise. Our observations align with Ziems et al.(2024), who noted that while LLMs have not yetreached the quality of human analysis in classi-fication tasks within CSS, large instruction-tunedLLMs are preferable. However, we observe that theopen-source model Llama-3 exhibits inferior per-formance compared to the non-open-source GPT-4.In terms of iii), our analysis of German par-liamentary debates from 1865 to 2022 revealsshifts in attitudes toward migrants influenced by la-bor demands, migration waves, and socio-politicalchanges. The evolution from group-based to com-passionate solidarity marks a shift towards eco-nomic pragmatism and issues of redistribution inmigration discourse, likely spurred by rising globalhumanitarianism (Vollmer and Karakayali, 2018).Despite traditional solidarity dominance, the resur-gence of anti-solidarity since WWII, peaking in2022, illustrates deepening political polarization.This underscores the ongoing tension betweenxenophobic tendencies and liberal ideals in Ger-many (Joppke, 2007; Lehr, 2015), reflecting thecomplex challenges of integration and multicultur-alism in a major migrant destination.These findings lay a strong foundation for furthersociological research using LLMs. Future workcould examine how shifts in political discourse im-pact policy-making and public opinion, exploringcorrelations with civic solidarity. Comparative stud-ies across countries with varying migration histo-ries may reveal factors influencing (anti-)solidarity.Additionally, exploring the effects of such rhetoric on related policies, like migration or equal opportu-nity, could yield further insights. From an NLP per-spective, future work can explore a broader rangeof LLMs, including those fine-tuned on Germandata, and explore the effect of using highlightingand explanations to improve classification.",
  "Our study faces several limitations that should beconsidered when interpreting the results": "The task of annotating political speech, par-ticularly concepts such as solidarity and anti-solidarity, poses significant challenges. Theseconcepts are inherently complex and ladenwith subtleties that are difficult to capture,both for human annotators and automatedmodels. Due to resource constraints, GPT-4 was ap-plied to only a portion of the dataset, poten-tially limiting the generalizability of our find-ings. Moreover, the proportional sampling ofinstances across decades might have led to theunderrepresentation of certain periods, whichcould have further impacted the comprehen-siveness of the analysis. While our analysis of solidarity and anti-solidarity frames distribution across partiescovers data from 1865 to 2022 and includesall historical periods, it does not trace the evo-lution of partisan discourse over time. Weassess the data comprehensively without fo-cusing on the specific historical emergence ofpolitical parties (e.g., AfD established in 2013versus SPD in 1863). Additional manual annotation features such asfree-comment explanations, highlighting, andindications of opposing positions (all avail-able in our human annotation) were not fullyexplored. These elements hold potential forfuture studies, which could use them as cuesfor LLMs to achieve a more nuanced classifi-cation.

  ": Example predictions by GPT-4 for both target groups in 0-shot setting for migrants and women (anti-solidarity cases). Bold text is the main sentence, the other sentences are for context": "Analyze the following German text and classify it into one of the high-level categories regarding migrants (refugees ? Flchtlinge, expellees ? Vertriebene, asylum seekers ? Asylbewerber, immigrants ? Einwanderer, and other migrant categories within Germany): SOLIDARITY, ANTI-SOLIDARITY, MIXED, or NONE. If applicable, further specify by choosing the most appropriate subtype (EMPATHIC, EXCHANGE-BASED, GROUP-BASED, COMPASSIONATE) within SOLIDARITY or ANTI-SOLIDARITY. Begin your response by providing the high-level category and then the subtype, if applicable. - SOLIDARITY: Involves expressions that promote understanding, support, and unity with different groups or individuals (migrants in our case), often emphasizing shared goals, compassion, mutual assistance, and empathic understanding. Consider cases with even slight expressions of solidarity, regardless of the main topic of the text. - ANTI-SOLIDARITY: Entails expressions that show opposition, disregard, or exclusion towards certain groups or individuals (migrants in our case). This includes emphasizing differences, denying the need for support or assistance, highlighting unequal exchanges between groups, and disregarding the unique characteristics or needs of certain groups. Even slight expressions of anti-solidarity should be considered, irrespective of the primary focus of the text. - MIXED: A mixed stance toward migrants is characterized by the presence of both supportive and opposing expressions within the same text. This stance emerges in discussions where acknowledgment of migrants' rights, contributions, or needs is juxtaposed with limitations, conditions, or reservations that counteract or diminish the initial support. Key features of a mixed stance include (but are not limited with): conditional hospitality and selective support; balanced policies (e.g. improve the situation of migrants already within the country, while simultaneously seeking to regulate or limit further influx); expressions of empathy or concern for migrants' hardships, contrasted with discussions on practical constraints, such as societal integration challenges, or national security concerns. - NONE: Texts which neither express solidarity nor anti-solidarity toward migrants in Germany, reflecting a neutral position or the absence of any specific stance. The absence of overt support or opposition does not automatically lead to a NONE classification; subtle cues or implicit messages may still align with solidarity or anti-solidarity categories. If the text falls into SOLIDARITY or ANTI-SOLIDARITY, please specify further by choosing the most appropriate subtype from the following, after the initial high-level classification. For SOLIDARITY: EMPATHIC SOLIDARITY, EXCHANGE-BASED SOLIDARITY, GROUP-BASED SOLIDARITY, COMPASSIONATE SOLIDARITY. Definitions: - EMPATHIC SOLIDARITY: Is coded when a group is different from others and this should be recognized, supported, valued. In applying empathic solidarity to migrants, this can be expressed by (but not limited with): recognition of diversity and individuality; emphasis on the importance of preserving migrants' identities when integrating them into new communities; advocating for the right to live authentically without fear of persecution or discrimination; challenging stereotypes, prejudices against migrants. - EXCHANGE-BASED SOLIDARITY: Is coded when a speaker refers to the usefulness of ?exchange partners? in terms of their actual or future contributions (economic, cultural, or social, etc.) or willingness to contribute. In applying exchange-based solidarity to migrants, this can be expressed by (but not limited with): emphasis on the importance of migrants' work, skills, and cultural diversity as essential for the host society; support for migrants which is framed as an investment in individuals who contribute to the community. - GROUP-BASED SOLIDARITY: Is coded when solidarity is based on the idea of unity and support among members of a group, driven by shared characteristics, goals, interests, values and norms, or common rights and duties. The support might be driven by shared characteristics or challenges aiming at broader societal change; fostering inclusivity, equality, societal cohesion (difference from compassionate solidarity). In applying group-based solidarity to migrants, this can be expressed by (but not limited with): a unified effort to address and advocate for migrants' rights, equality, and representation; advocacy aimed at ensuring migrants' full integration; active stance against discrimination and xenophobia. - COMPASSIONATE SOLIDARITY: Emphasizes providing support to marginalized, disadvantaged, or vulnerable groups, focusing on aid without expecting anything in return. It involves recognizing vulnerabilities, advocating for assistance to alleviate hardships, and offering support purely based on need. While not all indicators must be present, the core of compassionate solidarity lies in acknowledging and addressing the needs of those in vulnerable positions. The support is aimed at addressing vulnerabilities and needs without expectation of reciprocity; alleviating suffering and providing assistance based on need (difference from group-based solidarity). For ANTI-SOLIDARITY: GROUP-BASED ANTI-SOLIDARITY, EXCHANGE-BASED ANTI-SOLIDARITY, EMPATHIC ANTI-SOLIDARITY, COMPASSIONATE ANTI-SOLIDARITY. Definitions: - EMPATHIC ANTI-SOLIDARITY: Refers to the cases when a speaker refers to a group indicating that this group is different from everyone else, but this difference should not be respected or recognised. This can be expressed in: an overt or covert refusal to acknowledge the validity of a group's diverse identities, roles, and choices. Opposition to the group's efforts to define their identity, roles, and aspirations on their own terms. Promotion of a return to or maintenance of traditional societal roles and structures that restrict the group's opportunities. - EXCHANGE-BASED ANTI-SOLIDARITY: Focuses on the idea that some groups take more than they give. It brings attention to groups that seem to receive a lot of resources or support, but do not contribute much or cause problems. This perspective supports punishing such groups, giving them less help, or making them contribute more. This can be expressed in suggesting that this group should be punished, or get less than they are currently getting; calling for the group to give or do more in return for help. Remember: exchange-based criticisms focus on the economic implications and perceived unfairness in resource distribution (difference from compassionate anti-solidarity). - GROUP-BASED ANTI-SOLIDARITY: Points to an out-group characterised by pronounced differences, and an expression of exclusion. This can be expressed in: a stronger emphasis on one's own group's interests (e.g., We must stand up for our own interests...); resistance to support of, assimilation or integration with other groups. With migrants, this can be expressed as an emphasis on protecting interests of the native population at the expense of including migrants; portrayal of migrants as fundamentally different and unable to integrate, thus excluding them; a call for migrants to conform to existing norms without offering them full participation in society. - COMPASSIONATE ANTI-SOLIDARITY: It is about disregarding and excluding individuals or subgroups, refusing to support them either on the basis that they are perceived to be in a good position already, or are viewed as undeserving of help. When applied to migrants, this can be expressed by (but not limited with): denial of systemic issues (protections or affirmative actions are unnecessary or overreaching); security concerns, skepticism about the motives and legitimacy of asylum seekers. Remember, compassionate criticisms might question the necessity of certain protections or the legitimacy of migrants (difference from exchange-based anti-solidarity). Think step by step. Begin by analyzing the text to identify its high-level category related to migrants: SOLIDARITY, ANTI-SOLIDARITY, MIXED, or NONE. If the text falls under SOLIDARITY or ANTI-SOLIDARITY, further specify by identifying the most appropriate subtype: EMPATHIC, EXCHANGE-BASED, GROUP-BASED, or COMPASSIONATE. After your comprehensive analysis, conclude with 'Label:' followed by the most fitting category name. If identifying a subtype, combine it with the high-level category, such as GROUP-BASED SOLIDARITY, EXCHANGE-BASED SOLIDARITY, EMPATHIC SOLIDARITY, COMPASSIONATE SOLIDARITY, GROUP-BASED ANTI-SOLIDARITY, EXCHANGE-BASED ANTI-SOLIDARITY, EMPATHIC ANTI-SOLIDARITY, COMPASSIONATE ANTI-SOLIDARITY. Please choose just one label.",
