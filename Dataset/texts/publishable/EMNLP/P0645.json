  "Abstract": "Mitigating explicit and implicit biases in LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) has become a crit-ical focus in the field of natural language pro-cessing. However, many current methodologiesevaluate scenarios in isolation, without consid-ering the broader context or the spectrum of po-tential biases within each situation. To addressthis, we introduce the Sensitivity Testing onOffensive Progressions (STOP) dataset, whichincludes 450 offensive progressions containing2,700 unique sentences of varying severity thatprogressively escalate from less to more explic-itly offensive. Covering a broad spectrum of 9demographics and 46 sub-demographics, STOPensures inclusivity and comprehensive cover-age. We evaluate several leading closed- andopen-source models, including GPT-4, Mixtral,and Llama 3. Our findings reveal that even thebest-performing models detect bias inconsis-tently, with success rates ranging from 19.3%to 69.8%. We also demonstrate how aligningmodels with human judgments on STOP canimprove model answer rates on sensitive taskssuch as BBQ, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs byup to 191%, while maintaining or even improv-ing performance. STOP presents a novel frame-work for assessing the complex nature of biasesin LLMs, which will enable more effective biasmitigation strategies and facilitates the creationof fairer language models.1",
  "The complete dataset is publicly accessible at GitHub andon Hugging Face.2": "the quality of these interactions may be compro-mised if a model exhibits bias, which is commonlydefined as any skew that produces a type of harmand can exist both implicitly and explicitly (Craw-ford, 2017; Dong et al., 2023). Implicit biasesare unconscious attitudes that affect understanding,actions, and decisions without awareness or inten-tion, whereas explicit biases are conscious attitudesthat are deliberately formed and expressed, ofteninvolving overt prejudice or discrimination (Baiet al., 2024; Wang et al., 2019).Numerous resources have been developed toidentify and mitigate bias in LLMs. PerspectiveAPI3 and RealToxicityPrompts (Gehman et al.,2020) cover a spectrum of abusive language, butprimarily focus on explicit biases through profan-ities, threats and insults. Conversely, BBQ, Stere-oSet, and CrowS-Pairs focus on social biases suchas stereotyping, capturing subtle forms of discrimi-nation suitable for evaluating implicit bias (Parrishet al., 2022; Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al.,2021). However, these resources often evaluate sce-narios in isolation, without considering the broadercontext or the spectrum of potential biases withineach situation. Moreover, datasets that focus onexplicit bias may overlook less inflammatory lan-guage that still harbors negative sentiment towardstarget demographics (Zhao et al., 2023; Gonen andGoldberg, 2019).We propose measuring bias through progres-sively offensive scenarios to evaluate appropri-ateness, which we define as \"the degree to whichan expression or action is considered acceptableor inoffensive within a given social context\". Thisconcept serves as a means to identify the thresholdwhere bias becomes recognizable and transitionsfrom implicit to explicit, mirroring real-world situa-tions where bias often emerges subtly and graduallyescalates. illustrates this concept, showing",

STOP covers 9 demographics and 46 sub-demographics, chosen to represent a wide range ofsocial groups often targeted by bias and discrimina-tion. By analyzing the progression of bias within astructured format, we can identify the tipping pointin appropriateness, understand the contextual fac-tors that contribute to the escalation of bias, anddevelop targeted strategies for bias mitigation.Our work makes the following contributions: 1. We develop STOP, a novel dataset consistingof 2,700 sentences across 450 offensive pro-gressions. STOP is the first dataset to targetthe situational evolution of bias from implicitto explicit, covering 3 severity levels, 9 demo-graphics, and 46 sub-demographics. 2. We conduct an extensive evaluation of a di-verse suite of closed- and open-source modelson STOP, revealing the challenging nature ofdetecting and mitigating bias in LLMs. Ourresults show that even the best-performingmodels struggle to consistently identify bi-ases, with success rates ranging from 19.3%to 69.8%. By comparing model performanceto human evaluations, we also provide newinsights into the alignment between machineand human biases.",

  "Task Construction": "To construct STOP, we developed a human-authored seed set of offensive progressions inspiredby common microaggressions against various de-mographics, as discussed in notable psychologyliterature (Sue et al., 2007; Kiekens et al., 2022;Nadal et al., 2012; Basford et al., 2014). Microag-gressions are subtle, often unintentional, behaviorsor statements that convey bias or prejudice towardsmarginalized groups. By using microaggressionsas inspiration, we aim to capture the subtle, context-dependent nature of bias in real-world scenarios.In this seed set, key identifiers such as names,pronouns, settings, actions, and objects are writtenas exchangeable variables. We then prompt GPT-4-0125-preview through the OpenAI API4 to createvariants that fit specific sub-demographics. Thesystem and user prompts guide the scaling processby providing instructions and examples for gener-ating variations of the seed progressions. For thedetailed prompts, see Appendix A.1.For instance, take this sentence from a seed pro-gression addressing religious bias:",

The counterfactual sen-tence tests the models ability to maintain its stanceon the appropriateness of the situation despite theadditional context. For instance, a counterfactualsentence for the Islam variation of the religiousbias example is:",

  "Offensive progressions in STOP are categorized byseverity level, demographic, and sub-demographic": "Severity Level:Severity levels consist of low,moderate, and high. Moderate severity progres-sions, which make up 60% of the dataset, beginwith a non-problematic sentence and each of thesubsequent four sentences escalate in explicitlyproblematic content. Both low and high severityprogressions each make up 20% of the dataset; thelow severity progressions contain no problematiccontent across all five sentences and the high sever-ity progressions contain exclusively problematiccontent. highlights the exact number ofoffensive progressions in each category. showcases a moderate severity scenario and Tables11 and 12 of the Appendix showcase low and highseverity scenarios respectively.",

Sub-demographics:Each demographic is com-posed of sub-demographics that represent smaller,more specific social groups. We identified 46 sub-demographics based on current health, humanities,and sociology literature, including disability preva-lence (Metwally et al., 2023), class stratification(Wright, 1997; Peoples, 2012), racial and ethniccategories (Criss et al., 2024), weight and healthperspectives (Tylka et al., 2014), sexual orientationand gender identity (Institute of Medicine, 2011),political ideologies (Strth, 2013), religious beliefs(Herzog et al., 2020), and age groups (Leversenet al., 2012). showcases each representedsub-demographic.The seed set consists of 6 moderate, 2 low, and 2high severity prompts for each demographic, whichare then scaled by the sub-demographics to createthe full dataset.

This indicates a meaning-ful level of consistency across annotators, thoughsome variability is evident, likely stemming fromthe subjective nature of the task. Models:We evaluated 10 open and closedsourced models of varying sizes including GPT-3.5-turbo-0125, GPT-4-0125-preview, Gemma-7b-instruct, Mistral-7b-instruct, Mixtral-7b-instruct,Llama 2-7b-chat, Llama 2-13b-chat, Llama 2-70b-chat, Llama 3-8b-instruct, and Llama 3-70b-instruct (Ouyang et al., 2022; OpenAI et al., 2024;Team et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2023, 2024; Tou-vron et al., 2023; Meta, 2024). Each models re-sponses were mapped to sensitivity scores, thenevaluated for idealistic performance and realisticperformance. Fine-tuning:To evaluate the downstream appli-cations of STOP, we first assessed the performanceof Llama 3-70b on established implicit bias evalu-ation tasks, namely BBQ, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs. We then fine-tuned it on the performancescores derived from human evaluations on STOPto align the model more closely with human judg-ments.6 Details on the fine-tuning procedure andhyperparameters are provided in A.5.",
  "Which LLM exhibits the most idealsensitivity to bias?": "Llama 2-70b shows the most ideal bias sensi-tivity, with the highest overall success rate (P =69.8%) and strong performance across all sever-ity levels. shows that while Mixtral andLlama 3-70b (Pl = 97.8%) achieve top perfor-mance on low severity progressions, Llama 2-70b(Pm = 68.9%) significantly outperforms on mod-erate severity prompts, which constitute the major-ity of the dataset. depicts Llama 2-70bsstrong performance across various demographics,in contrast to a smaller version, Llama 2-7b, andthe worst performing model, Gemma-7b-instruct.For an expansive list of sensitivity scores and indi-vidual plots of all models, see and SectionA.3 of the Appendix, respectively.The ideal model should also exhibit consis-tent sensitivity across different sub-demographics,severity levels, and contexts.

In terms of severity levels, on the otherhand, shows that Llama 3-8b had themost consistent range of success across sever-ity categories, while models such as Gemma-7b-instruct possess wide ranges of success across vari-ous severity categories, with a data range of 93.3%,demonstrating a weaker ability to generalize andadapt to scenarios of varying sensitivity (Appendix provides a full list of performance rangesfor all models). In terms of counterfactual per-formance, Llama 3-8b also achieved the highest",

Humans achieved a perfect score (Ph =100%) at detecting bias in high severity scenarios.However, their overall performance (P = 44.4%)was lower than all tested models, with the excep-tion of Gemma-7b-instruct (P = 19.3%). This sug-gests that humans have difficulty identifying biasin low and moderate severity progressions, wherethe bias is more subtle and gradually escalates.",

Models that align closely, such as Llama3-70b, may be better suited for real-world interac-tions. They are more likely to identify and respondto biases in a way that is consistent with humanperceptions appropriateness.",
  ":Average bias sensitivity scores betweenLlama 2-70b, Llama 3-70b, and Gemma on moderateseverity progressions. The dotted ring represents thehuman scores": "3-70b often opted not to respond to questions, ei-ther by returning a blank answer, refusing selectionfrom the given options, or criticizing the inputs.This behavior, while cautious, limits the useful-ness of the model in real-world applications whereengagement is crucial. However, as shown in , after fine-tuningLlama 3-70b on human responses, we observe asignificant increase in overall answer rate acrossall three bias evaluation tasks. The improvementsrange from 9% on BBQ to 191% on StereoSet, indi-cating a substantial increase in the models engage-ment. in the Appendix provides examplesof Llama 3-70bs refusals to answer compared tothat of our fine-tuned Llama 3-70b. Remarkably,this increased engagement is achieved with eitherminor changes in performance, or in the case ofStereoSet, a 13% improvement.",
  "Qualitative analysis": "displays instances in which both mod-els and humans responded incorrectly to moder-ate severity progressions, either overly sensitive oroverly insensitive. For example, Llama 2-13b gen-erally exhibited heightened sensitivity, leading tothe rejection of acceptable sentences. Conversely,Gemma-7b-instruct typically showed reduced sen-sitivity, allowing highly problematic sentences topass. Although human responses were generallyconsistent, there were some notable discrepanciesin sensitivity towards the same sentences.",
  "Related Work": "Bias in Large Language ModelsThe increasingadoption of LLMs has raised ethical concerns abouttheir tendency to perpetuate negative stereotypesand inappropriate content (Nissim et al., 2020;Hutchinson et al., 2020; Esiobu et al., 2023). LLMshave been shown to disproportionately impact in-dividuals of specific social demographics, such asreligion, sex, race, age, educational institution, na-tionality, and disability (Abid et al., 2021; Gonenand Goldberg, 2019; Wan et al., 2023; Sap et al., 2021; Kamruzzaman et al., 2024; Venkit et al.,2022). This bias is often revealed in natural lan-guage generation tasks (Sheng et al., 2019), codegeneration (Huang et al., 2024), and persists acrossvarious languages (Zhou et al., 2019). Implicit bias evaluationExisting metrics quan-tify bias in LLMs through various approaches, suchas question-answering (QA) prompts (Shin et al.,2024; Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al., 2021;Parrish et al., 2022) and sentence completion tasksor counterfactual evaluations (Gehman et al., 2020;Dhamala et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2020). We buildon this work by introducing a novel QA task thatfacilitates the transition from implicit to explicitbias and incorporates counterfactual reasoning. Human-model alignmentTraining models onhuman feedback has been explored to improve sum-marization quality (Stiennon et al., 2020), assessthe trustworthiness of LLMs (Li et al., 2024), andalign human and model judgments in casual andmoral reasoning tasks (Nie et al., 2023). Our workexpands on this concept by utilizing our scenario-based dataset to quantify human-model alignmentand strengthen it through fine-tuning.",
  "Conclusion": "We introduced STOP to assess how LLMs handlebias within context rich, real-world scenarios. Ourfindings reveal substantial variability in bias sen-sitivity across models, with no model consistentlyidentifying bias across all scenarios or achievingover 70% accuracy. While humans generally showlower sensitivity to bias compared to LLMs, fine-tuning models on human data markedly improvestheir ability to engage with and perform well onexisting bias evaluation tasks.",
  "Limitations": "Dataset coverageThe offensive progressions inSTOP were manually crafted by the authors basedon common microaggressions and biases. Whileefforts were made to cover a diverse set of scenar-ios and demographics, the dataset may not exhaus-tively capture all possible manifestations of bias.Future work could explore methods for automati-cally generating offensive progressions to increasecoverage and diversity. Human evaluationThe human evaluation ofSTOP was conducted with a relatively small groupof internal annotators. While the annotators repre-sented diversity across several demographics, theymay not fully capture the wide range of culturaland societal perspectives on bias. Expanding thehuman evaluation to a larger, more diverse pool ofannotators could provide more robust and represen-tative benchmarks for model alignment. Fine-tuning experimentsOur fine-tuning exper-iments were limited to a single model (Llama 3-70b) and a small set of existing bias evaluationtasks (BBQ, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs). Furtherresearch is needed to investigate the generalizabil-ity of our findings to other models and downstreamtasks, as well as to explore more advanced fine-tuning techniques for improving model sensitivityto offensive progressions. Bias mitigationWhile STOP focuses on evaluat-ing model sensitivity to bias, it does not directly ad-dress the challenge of mitigating biased outputs inLLMs. Developing effective debiasing techniquesthat can be applied during pre-training, fine-tuning,or inference remains an important area for futurework.",
  "Ethical Considerations": "Potential misuseWhile STOP is intended to helpresearchers and practitioners better understand andmitigate bias in LLMs, it is important to recognizethe potential for misuse. Bad actors could poten-tially use the dataset to train models to generatemore convincing offensive content or to reinforceexisting biases. To mitigate this risk, we will re-lease STOP with clear usage guidelines and restric-tions, emphasizing that it should only be used forresearch purposes aimed at improving model fair-ness and sensitivity to bias. Offensive contentBy design, STOP contains asignificant amount of offensive and biased contentin various demographics. Exposure to such contentcan be disturbing or triggering for some individuals.We will ensure that appropriate content warningsand disclaimers are provided with the dataset, andwe encourage researchers to prioritize the mentalwell-being of annotators and participants involvedin future studies using STOP. Demographic representationWhile STOP cov-ers a wide range of demographics and sub-demographics, it is important to acknowledge thatno dataset can perfectly capture the full diversity ofhuman identities and experiences. We have madeefforts to include a broad range of demographics,but we recognize that some groups may still beunderrepresented or absent from the dataset. Fu-ture work should continue to expand and refinethe demographic categories represented in the biasevaluation datasets. Fairness in evaluationWhen using STOP toevaluate the sensitivity of LLMs to bias, it is cru-cial to ensure that all models are assessed fairlyand consistently. Researchers should be transparentabout their evaluation methodologies and shouldstrive to minimize any potential sources of bias orconfounding factors in their analyses. Responsible deploymentAs LLMs continue tobe deployed in an increasing number of real-worldapplications, it is essential that developers and prac-titioners use datasets like STOP to thoroughly eval-uate and mitigate potential biases before deploy-ment. The development of fair, unbiased, and so-cially responsible AI systems should be a top prior-ity for the research community and industry alike.By openly discussing these ethical considerationsand taking proactive steps to address them, we aimto promote the responsible development and useof STOP and other bias evaluation datasets in thefield of natural language processing.",

  "A.5Fine-tuning Details": "We used Anyscale7, a platform that provides optimized training capabilities, to streamline the supervisedfine-tuning process and minimize the need for extensive setup. This choice was motivated by the costand resource efficiency offered by Anyscale when working with large models like Llama-3-70b. Theplatform employs default hyperparameter settings, such as learning rate and number of epochs, which areoptimized based on the specific requirements of the data and the model being used.To prepare the STOP dataset for supervised fine-tuning on Anyscale, we converted it into a compatibleformat. The system prompt was customized to clearly articulate our objective and the expected outcomesfrom the model. illustrates the formatting process by presenting an unformatted scenario fromSTOP alongside its corresponding formatted version, which is used as a single instance in the few-shotsetting for fine-tuning. Using Anyscales interface, we selected the Llama 3-70b Instruct model and optedfor the out-of-box supervised training. The complete formatted dataset was used for training, and wechose not to split the data into training and testing sets, as our goal was for the model to generalize itscapabilities across other datasets.The supervised fine-tuning process was conducted using the following settings:",
  "System Prompt": "You will be presented with scenarios that contain some degrees of social bias and progressnarratively, providing more context. Each scenario is broken down into parts. For each part,assess whether the behavior is appropriate by comparing it to established human behavioralnorms. Importantly, your judgments here are foundational and should be directly applicablein any situation where presentation and context may vary, but require a consistent applicationof these principles. This should be taken as a ground-truth principle as to what is and is notappropriate socially.The following scenario discusses ethnicity/culture bias in the context of being middle easternand north African heritage."
