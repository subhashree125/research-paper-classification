  "Abstract": "Recently, tool use with LLMs has become oneof the primary research topics as it can helpLLM generate truthful and helpful responses.Existing studies on tool use with LLMs pri-marily focus on enhancing the tool-calling abil-ity of LLMs. In practice, like chat assistants,LLMs are also required to align with humanvalues in the context of tool use. Specifically,LLMs should refuse to answer unsafe tooluse relevant instructions and insecure tool re-sponses to ensure their reliability and harmless-ness. At the same time, LLMs should demon-strate autonomy in tool use to reduce the costsassociated with tool calling. To tackle this is-sue, we first introduce the principle that LLMsshould follow in tool use scenarios: H2A. Thegoal of H2A is to align LLMs with helpful-ness, harmlessness, and autonomy. In ad-dition, we propose ToolAlign, a dataset com-prising instruction-tuning data and preferencedata to align LLMs with the H2A principlefor tool use. Based on ToolAlign, we developLLMs by supervised fine-tuning and prefer-ence learning, and experimental results demon-strate that the LLMs exhibit remarkable tool-calling capabilities, while also refusing to en-gage with harmful content, and displaying ahigh degree of autonomy in tool utilization.The code and datasets are available at:",
  "Introduction": "Recently, the integration of Large Language Mod-els (LLMs) with external tools has garnered signifi-cant attention from the research community (Qinet al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2024b; Yao et al.,2022; Gu et al., 2024). By calling external tools,LLMs can access real-time information on the in-ternet (Xu et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023; Qin et al.,",
  "*Corresponding author": "2023b), retrieve knowledge bases to enhance thetruthfulness of their responses (Hao et al., 2024;Zhuang et al., 2024), and manipulate external com-ponents (such as code runners and robotic arms)to complete tasks (Gao et al., 2023; Huang et al.,2022). Although some closed-source LLMs (suchas GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) and Gemini (Teamet al., 2023)) exhibit impressive tool-calling abili-ties, the tool-calling abilities of open-source LLMs(such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023b) and Al-paca (Taori et al., 2023)) remain limited. Therefore,some recent work (Qin et al., 2023b; Tang et al.,2023; Wang et al., 2024a) collects tool use exam-ples to train open-source LLMs to enhance theirtool-calling abilities.While enhancing the tool-calling ability (help-fulness) of LLMs is important, similar to chat-assistants (Bai et al., 2022b; Sun et al., 2024; Kpfet al., 2024), LLMs also need to align with humanvalues in the context of tool use. For example,in real-world scenarios, LLMs may be instructedto collect private information and convey harmfulmessages (Yuan et al., 2024b; Ye et al., 2024). Inaddition, external tools can be subject to maliciousattacks or interception, returning unexpectedly in-secure responses (Ye et al., 2024). Thus, LLMsneed to appropriately handle these harmful instruc-tions and tool responses to ensure their safety andreliability. Moreover, for queries that LLMs candirectly answer (e.g., \"Can you tell me what thethree primary colors are?\"), LLMs should provideresponses without calling any tools, thereby reduc-ing costs and saving time.In this work, we first introduce the principle thatLLMs should adhere to in tool use scenarios: H2A,which consists of helpfulness, harmlessness, andautonomy. For helpfulness, LLMs should under-stand user instructions and accurately call exter-nal tools to provide informative responses. Forharmlessness, LLMs should refuse to engage withunsafe user instructions and tool responses. For",

(b) Harmlessness: LLMs should refuse to answer harmful user instructions andavoid engaging with insecure tool responses. (c) Autonomy: To save time and costs, LLMs should directly answerinstructions when possible, without utilizing tools.",
  "autonomy, LLMs should answer queries directlywhen possible, without relying on external tools": "To align LLMs with the H2A principle, we cre-ate ToolAlign based on the ToolBench dataset (Qinet al., 2023b), which focuses on helpfulness,to include data on harmlessness and autonomy.ToolAlign consists of two parts: an instruction-tuning dataset and a preference dataset. In theinstruction-tuning dataset, for helpfulness, we sam-ple instruction-response pairs from ToolBench. Forharmlessness, we curate harmful instructions in-volve privacy information theft and unsafe out-put guidance.We also include normal instruc-tions with insecure tool responses like phishinginformation and attack messages. For autonomydata, we sample and rephrase instructions fromAlpaca (Taori et al., 2023), which consist of di-verse queries such as commonsense questions andcreative writing. We then task ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) to provide high-quality responses to harm-lessness and autonomy instructions (Wang et al.,2022; Cui et al., 2023). Ultimately, we obtain 46kinstruction-response pairs in the instruction-tuningdataset. In the preference dataset, we obtain 10kinstructions that include helpfulness, harmlessness,and autonomy categories, following the construc-tion process of the instruction-tuning dataset. Foreach instruction, we sample two responses: onefrom ChatGPT, and the other from either ToolL-LaMA (Qin et al., 2023b) or AlignToolLLaMA-SFT (a model obtained by training ToolLLaMA onthe ToolAlign instruction-tuning dataset). We thenprompt ChatGPT to evaluate the quality of thesetwo responses to obtain the preferences.",
  "To validate the effectiveness of ToolAlign": "in aligning LLMs with the H2A principle, wefirst train ToolLLaMA through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the instruction-tuning dataset,obtaining AlignToolLLaMA-SFT. Subsequently,we further train AlignToolLLaMA-SFT usingdirect preference optimization (Rafailov et al.,2024) (DPO) on the preference dataset, result-ing in AlignToolLLaMA-DPO. Experimental re-sults demonstrate that:(1) AlignToolLLaMA-SFT shows a significant improvement in harm-lessness and autonomy compared to ToolLLaMA(96.4% vs. 0% on the harmful instruction testsetand 100.0% vs. 22.0% on the autonomy testset).(2) AlignToolLLaMA-DPO exhibits a further en-hancement in helpfulness and harmlessness overAlignToolLLaMA-SFT. For example, the averagepass rate of AlignToolLLaMA-DPO on the helpful-ness testset is 49.8%, whereas AlignToolLLaMA-SFT is 27.3%.",

LLMs need to identify theseharmful content and provide refusal responses toensure their safety and reliability. 3) Generally, us-ing external tools often incurs time and financialcosts. Therefore, LLMs should directly provide an-swers to instructions they can handle without call-ing external tools. Based on these considerations,we propose the H2A principle, which advocates forthe helpfulness, harmlessness, and autonomy thatLLMs should adhere to in tool use scenarios. To align LLMs with the H2A principle, LLMsshould be trained on data that encompasses allthree dimensions. Although some relevant bench-marks have been proposed to evaluate the harmless-ness (Ye et al., 2024) or autonomy (Huang et al.,2023; Gui et al., 2024) of LLMs, there is still nocomprehensive dataset that includes all dimensionsin LLMs tool use scenarios. This motivates us toconstruct the ToolAlign dataset, aimed at improv-ing and evaluating the helpfulness, harmlessness,and autonomy of LLMs in tool use scenarios. Thedataset includes an instruction-tuning dataset and apreference dataset.",
  "ToolAlign Construction": "To ensure our dataset includes a large number ofreal tools, we construct ToolAlign based on Tool-Bench (Qin et al., 2023b), which comprises over3, 000 tools and aims to construct a instruction-tuning dataset to enhance the helpfulness of LLMs.In ToolAlign, we collect and curate an instruction-tuning dataset and a preference dataset to alignLLMs with all three dimensions of H2A. Weprovide the flowchart of ToolAlign dataset con-struction in Appendix A.1. Detailed statistics ofToolAlign are shown in .",
  "Instruction-tuning Dataset": "In the instruction-tuning dataset, we sample help-fulness data from ToolBench. In addition, we con-struct harmlessness and autonomy data to ensurethat LLMs trained on our instruction-tuning datasetcan exhibit harmlessness and autonomy. Harmlessness.In harmlessness, we considertwo scenarios: harmful user instructions and harm-ful tool responses.For harmful instructions,we curate them using two methods: (1) We ran-domly select 1k instructions from ToolBench andprompt ChatGPT to transform these instructionsinto unsafe ones. Following LLaMA-2 safeguard-ing rules (Touvron et al., 2023b), we primarilyadd 1) privacy content, 2) potentially harmful orillicit topics, and 3) professional but unqualifiedadvice to the instructions. (2) We follow the safety-LLaMA (Bianchi et al., 2023) approach and ran-domly sample 1k harmful instructions from the An-thropic Red Teaming Dataset (Ganguli et al., 2022)(ARTD). However, the length and format of instruc-tions in ARTD differ from those in ToolBench (asshown in ). To avoid LLMs learning short-cuts due to these differences, we prompt ChatGPTto rewrite the sampled instructions. Additionally,we use the API retriever trained on ToolBench,which is based on Sentence-BERT (Reimers andGurevych, 2019), to retrieve 3-6 relevant APIs forthe instructions. The API retriever encodes all APIdocuments and instructions into embeddings andthen selects the top-k most similar APIs for eachinstruction based on their embeddings.To annotate harmful instructions, we input the in-structions (without tools) into ChatGPT and promptit to provide refusal responses. To ensure the re-fusal responses also reflect helpfulness, we struc-ture them into three parts: (1) Clearly state that theinstruction is harmful and cannot be answered. (2)Identify the harmful content within the instructionand explain its potential impact. (3) Suggest thatthe user provide a safe request.For harmful tool responses, to simulate realscenarios where tools are hacked, we consider thefollowing four types of harmful responses: (1) Ob-viously harmful content: these tool responses con-tain clearly discriminatory, illicit, or unsafe frag-ments. (2) Phishing sites: these tool responsesmasquerade as official replies (e.g., from Apple orGoogle) but contain phishing sites or harmful links.(3) Attack attachments: these tool responses in-clude malicious bash scripts or programs. (4) Sen- sitive information requirements: these responsesrequest privacy or sensitive information from theuser, such as bank accounts and passwords. Forthe obviously harmful content category, we sampleharmful content from AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023).For the other three categories, we first handcraftsome in-context examples and then use ChatGPTto generate similar content. We sample and rewrite841 instructions from ToolBench, and replace onerelevant tool response a the harmful tool responsefor each instruction.For harmful tool response annotations, we firsthandcraft a refusal template that includes the nameof the harmful tool and the type of the harmfulresponse. We then fill in the specific tool namesand harmful types into the template to create thefinal responses. Autonomy.We sample 3881 instructions fromthe Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) dataset. Since theinstructions in Alpaca and ToolBench also differin length and format (see ), we use Chat-GPT to rewrite the instructions and employ theToolBench retriever to retrieve relevant APIs foreach instruction. Finally, we provide the instruc-tions (without tools) to ChatGPT and prompt it togenerate responses.Allinstructiongenerationandannotationprompts are detailed in Appendix A.2 and Ap-pendix A.3, respectively.",
  "Preference Dataset": "Helpfulness.We randomly sample instructionsfrom ToolBench and obtain two responses foreach instruction:one from ChatGPT and theother from either ToolLLaMA (Qin et al., 2023b)or AlignToolLLaMA-SFT (acquired by trainingToolLLaMA on the ToolAlign instruction-tuningdataset). To determine the response preferencesfor each instruction, we prompt ChatGPT to assesswhether each response completes the instruction.If only one response successfully completes theinstruction, we select this response as the chosenresponse and label the other as the rejected re-sponse. If both responses complete the instruction,we prioritize the response from ChatGPT as thechosen response because ChatGPT consistentlydemonstrates higher average response quality com-pared to ToolLLaMA and AlignToolLLaMA-SFT(as indicated by the win rate in ). If both re-sponses fail to complete the instruction, we discardthe data. Ultimately, we obtain 10k preference data",
  "for helpfulness": "Harmlessness.For harmful instructions, wefirst obtain 400 harmful instructions by methods de-scribed in .2.1. We then provide these in-structions (without tools) to ChatGPT and prompt itto generate refusal responses. In addition, we sam-ple responses from ToolLLaMA for these instruc-tions. Since ToolLLaMA does not exhibit harm-lessness (as shown in ), we label responsesfrom ChatGPT as the chosen and responses fromToolLLaMA as the rejected. Additionally, aswe design prompts to elicit refusal responses fromChatGPT, the helpfulness of chosen responses isguaranteed. For harmful tool responses, we sam-ple instruction-response pairs where ChatGPT failsto recognize harmful tools in the response, and la-bel these responses as rejected. Then we handcraftrefusal responses for each instruction and labelthem as chosen. Autonomy.We first rewrite 300 instructionsfrom Alpaca and retrieve relevant tools to these in-structions. Then we provide each instruction (with-out tool) to ChatGPT and collect its responses. Ad-ditionally, we sample responses from ToolLLaMAfor each instruction. Subsequently, for instructionswhere ToolLLaMA does not provide a direct an-swer, we label the responses from ChatGPT aschosen. For instructions where ToolLLaMA pro-vides a direct answer, we use GPT-4 to evaluate thehelpfulness of responses from both ChatGPT andToolLLaMA (the prompt is in ), and welabel the responses with higher scores as chosen.",
  "Models Powered by ToolAlign": "To align LLMs with the H2A principle and vali-date the effectiveness of ToolAlign, we train LLMsbased on ToolAlign. Given that ToolLLaMA (Qinet al., 2023b) has already demonstrated excellenttool-calling capabilities, we leverage ToolLLaMAfor efficient model development. To equip Tool-LLaMA with harmlessness and autonomy, wefirst train it on the instruction-tuning dataset inToolAlign by SFT, obtaining AlignToolLLaMA-SFT. Subsequently, we train AlignToolLLaMA-SFT on the preference dataset in ToolAlign by DPOto further enhance the helpfulness, harmless, andautonomy, resulting in AlignToolLLaMA-DPO.For SFT, we train the models for 2 epochs, witha global batch size of 64 and a linear learning ratescheduler with a peak learning rate of 5e 5 and4% warm-up ratios. For DPO, we train the models for 1 epoch with a learning rate of 1e 6, using alinear scheduler with 5 warm-up steps and a globalbatch size of 8. In addition, we set = 0.05. Allexperiments are run on 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs with40 GB capacity using bfloat16 precision.",
  "Experimental Setup": "Evaluation Metrics.For helpfulness instruc-tions, we evaluate LLMs responses by utilizingToolEval in ToolBench. In ToolEval, we report thePass Rate (PR), which evaluates whether LLMsresponses complete the instructions, and the WinRate (WR), which makes a lose-win decision overLLMs responses compared to ChatGPT responses.For harmfulness instructions and harmfulnesstool responses, we prompt GPT-4 (gpt-4-turbo)to judge if the responses refuse to answer harm-ful instructions, and then we calculate the RefusalResponse Rate (3R). For autonomy instructions,we evaluate the Direct Response Rate (DR2) with-out invoking any tool. Additionally, we establishguidelines and prompt GPT-4 to score the helpful-ness (Cui et al., 2023) of responses to harmful andautonomy instructions. All detailed prompts areillustrated in Appendix A.4. Baselines.We compare our models with threeopen-source models: ToolLLaMA(v2) (Qin et al.,2023b), LLaMA-2-chat-7B (Touvron et al., 2023b),which is aligned for dialogue use cases, and Qwen2-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024), which undergoessafety alignment and demonstrates satisfactory tool-calling ability. We also include three closed-sourcemodels, ChatGPT, GPT-4, and GPT-4o, as strongbaselines. We add instructions into the systemprompt of ChatGPT, GPT-4, and GPT-4o to remindthem to refuse to answer harmful content and toautonomously use tools.",
  "Overall Results on ToolAlign": "In this section, we evaluate AlignToolLLaMA andbaseline on ToolAlign in helpfulness, harmlessness,and autonomy. The experimental results are shownin . From the table, we observe that:(1) Closed-source LLMs can demonstrate sat-isfactory helpfulness, but their harmlessness andautonomy are limited to some extent. For GPT-4, one of the most powerful models, although iteffectively refuses to respond to harmful instruc-tions (HI) (with an 85.6% refusal response rate)and harmful tool responses (HTR) (with a 76.5% refusal response rate), the autonomy of the GPT-4model is limited, with only 11.0% of instructionson the autonomy testset being answered directly.Although ChatGPT achieves impressive results interms of helpfulness, it nearly fails to demonstrateharmlessness and autonomy, scoring 3.1% on HIand 0% on AU (autonomy). The results indicatethat models aligned in chat scenarios can general-ize to tool use scenarios, but the generalization islimited.(2) Open-source LLMs can hardly exhibit harm-lessness and autonomy in tool use scenarios. WhileLLaMA-2-Chat cannot demonstrate tool-callingability (with an average pass rate of 0% on the help-fulness test set), ToolLLaMA, trained on large scaletool-calling data, shows a degree of proficiency intool use (with an average pass rate of 32.7% onthe helpfulness testset). However, the harmlessnessand autonomy capabilities of ToolLLaMA remaininadequate, with a 0% refusal response rate on bothHI and HTR. Although Qwen2-7B-Instruct is ableto refuse harmful instructions to some extent (witha refusal response rate of 41.2% on HI), it fails toreject harmful tool responses and performs poorlyin autonomy (scoring 0.0% on HIR and 10.0% onAU). This also indicates that safety alignment forgeneral instructions has limited effectiveness intool use scenarios.The results of closed-source and open-sourceLLMs on the testset highlight the urgent need andimportance of constructing a dataset that simulta-neously focuses on helpfulness, harmlessness, andautonomy to facilitate the deployment of LLMs inreal-world tool use scenarios.(3) By supervised fine-tuning on ToolAlign,AlignToolLLaMA-SFT shows remarkable improve-ments in harmlessness and autonomy compared toToolLLaMA. Specifically, AlignToolLLaMA-SFThas an average refusal response rate of 98.20%on the harmlessness testset (0% for ToolLLaMA)and a direct response rate of 100% on the au-tonomy testset (22% for ToolLLaMA). Addition-ally, AlignToolLLaMA-SFT achieves an averagepass rate of 27.3% on helpfulness testset, which isslightly lower than ToolLLaMA. The reason mightbe that the introduction of harmlessness and auton-omy leads to a trade-off in helpfulness.(4) AlignToolLLaMA-DPO, further trained onpreference data, demonstrated outstanding helpful-ness, harmlessness, and autonomy. In terms ofhelpfulness, AlignToolLLaMA-DPO has an aver-age pass rate of 49.8% on the helpfulness testset,",

Insummary, the results indicate that ToolAlign caneffectively enhance the helpfulness, harmlessness,and autonomy of LLMs in tool use scenarios.In addition, we prompt GPT-4 to score the help-fulness of responses to the HI testset and AU test-set provided by the LLMs. The experimental re-sults are shown in .From the figure,AlignToolLLaMA-SFT and AlignToolLLaMA-DPO provide informative responses on both test- sets. Specifically, for harmful instructions, theaverage helpfulness scores of AlignToolLLaMA-SFT and AlignToolLLaMA-DPO responses are4.80 and 4.87, respectively. This indicates thatboth models can learn how to produce helpful re-sponses by training on ToolAlign. Since we donot specifically design prompts to guide GPT-4 inproducing high-scoring refusal responses, the scoreof GPT-4 is relatively low. However, GPT-4 stilldemonstrates a certain level of helpfulness in re-fusal responses. For autonomy instructions, thehelpfulness scores of AlignToolLLaMA-SFT andAlignToolLLaMA-DPO responses are 3.77 and3.86, respectively. This suggests that through pref-erence optimization, AlignToolLLaMA-DPO fur-ther learns how to provide more helpful responsesto autonomy instruction. However, both modelsstill lag behind GPT-4 (with a score of 4.73). Wespeculate that this is due to the limitations of modelsize and inherent knowledge capacity, preventingthem from achieving higher scores.",
  "Ablation Studies": "Impact Detection of the Training Process.Toinvestigate the impact of two training processes(SFT and DPO) on the LLMs performance on H2A,we introduce two additional training methods: (1)Selecting the chosen samples from ToolAlignpreference data, and further supervised fine-tuneAlignToolLLaMA-SFT on the chosen samples(denoted by +SFT with Prefenrece Data). (2) Di-rectly performing DPO training on ToolLLaMA",

The ex-perimental results are presented in . From, we observe the following:(1) The DPO process is crucial for furtherenhancing helpfulness, harmlessness, and auton-omy. The +SFT with Prefenrece Data model,obtained by continually fine-tuning AlignToolL-LaMA on the chosen samples in the preferencedata, has an average pass rate of 12.9% on the help-fulness testset, lagging behind the average passrate of 24.7% for AlignToolLLaMA. Addition-ally, compared to AlignToolLLaMA, the +SFTwith Prefenrece Data model shows slight reduc-tions in harmlessness and autonomy. In contrast,the AlignToolLLaMA-DPO model, trained usingDPO on the preference data, demonstrates signifi-cant improvements in helpfulness. This highlightsthat continuing to train through SFT is insufficientfor AlignToolLLaMA-SFT to further enhance theperformance. Therefore, it is necessary to intro-duce negative examples and conduct DPO training.DPO can help LLMs learn preference patterns fromthe data, thereby guiding them to generate higher-quality responses.(2) The SFT process is essential for LLMs toacquire harmlessness and improve autonomy. The+DPO with Prefenrece Data model, which is di-rectly trained on ToolLLaMA by DPO, achievesthe same score as ToolLLaMA on the harmlessnesstestset (both scoring 0). Furthermore, the auton-omy capability of the +DPO with Prefenrece Data model shows only a minor improvement comparedto ToolLLaMA (from 22.0% to 32.0%). This in-dicates that without acquiring fundamental harm-lessness and autonomy through the SFT process,LLMs cannot directly enhance these capabilitiesthrough preference learning.",
  "Generalization Analysis": "In this section, we conduct experiments on theToolSword (Ye et al., 2024) and MetaTool (Huanget al., 2023) datasets to evaluate the harmless-ness and autonomy of AlignToolLLaMA-SFT andAlignToolLLaMA-DPO, aiming to verify theirgeneralization and robustness. Specifically, weuse Malicious Queries, Jailbreak Attacks, andHarmful Feedback from the ToolSword dataset(denoted by ToolSword-MQ, ToolSword-JA, andToolSword-HF, respectively) to assess the capabili-ties of LLMs in rejecting harmful instructions andharmful tool responses. Notably, ToolSword-JAuses jailbreak methods to make it more challeng-ing for LLMs to recognize harmful instructions.In addition, we randomly select 100 samples fromthe Awareness of Tool Use subset of MetaTool toevaluate the autonomy capability of LLMs.Experimental results are presented in Ta-ble 4.In general, AlignToolLLaMA-SFT andAlignToolLLaMA-DPO demonstrate powerful gen-eralization abilities in terms of harmlessnessand autonomy.

  "Human Evaluation": "In the previous experiments, we employ GPT-4 toscore the helpfulness of model responses on boththe harmful instruction testset and the autonomytestset (). To verify the agreement betweenGPT-4 scores and human scores, we randomly se-lect 50 responses from each testset and providehumans with scoring criteria (detailed criteria canbe found in the and of the ap-pendix) for evaluating the helpfulness of the re-sponses. We then calculate the Pearson CorrelationCoefficient between the scores given by GPT-4 andthose given by humans to measure the consistencyof the scores. The Pearson Correlation Coefficientsbetween GPT-4 scores and human scores are 0.921for the harmful instruction testset and 0.822 for theautonomy testset. For the autonomy testset, wefind that GPT-4 sometimes fails to recognize com-monsense errors in the responses, leading to somediscrepancies between its scores and human scores.Despite this, the results still indicate a high con-sistency between GPT-4 helpfulness scoring andhuman judgment.",
  "Related Work": "Tool learning for LLMs.Tool learning enablesLLMs to understand and utilize external tools toaccomplish various tasks (Wang et al., 2023b; Shenet al., 2024).By calling external tools, LLMscan retrieve real-time (Tang et al., 2023) and rel-evant information (Gu et al., 2024) to enhance the factual accuracy and reliability of their re-sponses. Current closed-source LLMs (Achiamet al., 2023; Team et al., 2023) have demonstratedimpressive tool-calling abilities. To explore andenhance the tool-calling abilities of open-sourcemodels such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a,b),the research community mainly focuses on two ap-proaches. One involves collecting extensive anddiverse tool-calling trajectories from closed-sourceLLMs and train open-source models on the col-lected data (Qin et al., 2023b; Tang et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024a). The other concentrates onenhancing prompt strategies, such as unifying tooldescription documents (Hsieh et al., 2023; Yuanet al., 2024a) and providing detailed examples (Luet al., 2024)In practical tool use scenarios, it is importantfor LLMs to align with human values to demon-strate their reliability. Currently, several relevantbenchmarks have been proposed to evaluate eitherthe harmlessness (Ye et al., 2024) or the auton-omy of LLMs in tool use scenarios (Huang et al.,2023; Gui et al., 2024). However, there is still nowork focused on simultaneously aligning the help-fulness, harmlessness, and autonomy of LLMs intool use scenarios. In this work, we construct theToolAlign dataset, which concentrates on all threedimensions. Alignment for LLMs.LLMs alignment, whichaims to ensure that LLMs are aligned with humanvalues (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a; Guoet al., 2024) and can effectively handle adversarialinputs (Dai et al., 2023; Ge et al., 2023; Bianchiet al., 2023), has emerged as a crucial step for thedeployment of LLMs. To align LLMs, researchersfirst design alignment rules or principles (Bai et al.,2022b; Sun et al., 2024) and collect correspondingdatasets. Then, they train vanilla LLMs throughsupervised fine-tuning (Sun et al., 2024; Zong et al.,2024; Wallace et al., 2024) or reinforcement learn-ing (Ouyang et al., 2022; Cohen et al., 2022) to en-sure the models adhere to these designed principles.In real-world applications, LLMs need to continu-ously interact with external environments (Wanget al., 2023a; Yao et al., 2022) and receive feed-back (Asai et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b). There-fore, LLMs require alignment of capabilities tai-lored to different environments and scenarios. Inthis work, we consider LLM alignment in tool usescenarios and propose a principle, H2A, to guideLLMs behavior in tool use settings.",
  "Conclusions": "In this work, we introduce the H2A principle, fo-cusing on the helpfulness, harmlessness, and au-tonomy of LLMs in tool-use scenarios. To alignLLMs with this principle, we present a dataset,ToolAlign, which includes instruction-tuning dataand preference data for tool learning, and then trainToolLLaMA on ToolAlign through fine-tuning andpreference learning. Experimental results demon-strate that LLMs trained on ToolAlign effectivelyalign with the H2A principle.",
  "Ethical Considerations and Limitations": "In this work, we take the initial step towards align-ing LLMs with the principles of helpfulness, harm-lessness, and autonomy in tool use scenarios. How-ever, in the real world, human values are morecomplex, necessitating a deeper understanding ofhuman values to better align LLMs with humansin tool use. In addition, while our model demon-strates remarkable helpfulness, harmlessness, andautonomy in tool-use scenarios, our experiments donot fully capture the complexities and challenges ofmulti-turn dialog interactions. Extending the modelto handle multi-turn dialog scenarios is essentialfor evaluating its effectiveness in utilizing tools andproviding coherent and safe responses across inter-actions. This would require LLMs to maintain longcontexts and integrate historical dialog records tocall the correct tools. Addressing these aspects willbe crucial for enhancing the models applicabilityin real-world, multi-turn conversational applica-tions.",
