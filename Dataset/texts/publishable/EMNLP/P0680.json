  "Abstract": "In translation, a concept represented by a singleword in a source language can have multiplevariations in a target language. The task of lex-ical selection requires using context to identifywhich variation is most appropriate for a sourcetext. We work with native speakers of nine lan-guages to create DTAiLS, a dataset of 1,377sentence pairs that exhibit cross-lingual con-cept variation when translating from English.We evaluate recent LLMs and neural machinetranslation systems on DTAiLS, with the best-performing model, GPT-4, achieving from 67to 85% accuracy across languages. Finally, weuse language models to generate English rulesdescribing target-language concept variations.Providing weaker models with high-quality lex-ical rules improves accuracy substantially, insome cases reaching or outperforming GPT-4.",
  "Introduction": "Resolving ambiguity in translation is a fundamentalchallenge (Weaver, 1952) that remains unsolved(Campolungo et al., 2022). This paper focuseson lexical selection, a key aspect of translationthat requires using context in a source sentence todetermine the best translation for an ambiguoussource word from several target-language options. shows variations of the concept date (fruit)in Farsi and an example of the lexical selection task.Our work has two main goals. First, we in-vestigate the capabilities of language models indisambiguating lexical choices in translation bycomparing instruction-tuned language models withhigh-performing neural machine translation sys-tems. Second, we test whether language modelscan be used to extract useful natural language rulesthat accurately describe how to translate ambiguouswords based on source-side context.We work with native speakers to introduce theDataset of Translations with Ambiguity in LexicalSelection (DTAiLS), a test set of 1,377 sentence",
  "Concept: date (fruit)": "Variations and Generated RulesKhorma refers to the fruit of the date palm when it isfully ripe and dried.It is commonly consumed as a sweet,chewy snack or used in various dishes, particularly desserts. Rotabreferstofresh,softdatesthatarepartiallyripe. These dates are moister and sweeter than fully ripe,dried dates (khorma). Rotab is often eaten as a fresh fruitor used in cooking where a softer, sweeter texture is desired.",
  ": Generated rules for English date with lexicalvariations khorma, rotab, and kharak in Farsi": "pairs spanning nine languages where concept vari-ation can be explained by context in the sourcesentence. Evaluating five models on DTAiLS re-veals that, without rules provided in-context, onlythe best-performing LLM, GPT-4, is competitivewith NMT systems.We also present a simple method for generatingrules for lexical selection from LLMs, which na-tive speakers verify are highly accurate. shows rules generated for three Farsi variations ofthe concept date. We observe improvements inperformance across all LLMs when prompted withaccurate self-generated rules. In addition, whileopen-weight LLMs lag behind both NMT systemsand GPT-4, providing rules from GPT-4 can helpsubstantially to bridge the gap in performance. Thissuggests that parametric knowledge of concept vari-ation poses a greater challenge to models than theability to apply such knowledge in-context. Ourwork demonstrates that LMs can generate high-quality rules, and further leverage these rules torival specialized NMT systems on lexical selection,but still fall short of native speakers.1",
  "Task and Data": "To evaluate a models ability to understand con-cept variations, we study lexical selection in trans-lation. For example, the noun date has multiplelexical variations in Farsi, which distinguishes vari-ations by fruit ripeness and dryness (). Wecollect a dataset of translation pairs that requireunderstanding and appropriately applying conceptvariation, where sufficient context is provided todistinguish between variations. Lexical SelectionIn translation, lexical selectionis the task of selecting the most appropriate lex-eme in the target language that maps from a singlelexeme in the source language, in the context of asource sentence (Apidianaki, 2009). Formally, let(x, y) be a sentence pair where x = x1, . . . , x|x|is a sequence of words in the source language andy = y1, . . . , y|y| is its translation in the targetlanguage. For a source word xi, we define the setof possible translations of xi as v = v1, . . . , v|v|where j such that vj y. The task of lexicalselection is to identify the most appropriate transla-tion vj conditioned on the source sentence x. Source DataDespite the existence of large-scaledatasets for low-resource languages through bitextmining techniques (Schwenk et al., 2021), we fo-cus on datasets curated by human translators tomitigate the potential for incorrect translations dueto misalignment. We use OpenSubtitles (Lison andTiedemann, 2016; Lison et al., 2018), TED2020(Reimers and Gurevych, 2020), PMIndia (Had-dow and Kirefu, 2020), and TEP (Pilehvar et al.,2011) to acquire parallel data for English pairedwith 7 low-resource and 2 high-resource languages(Japanese and Farsi).2All datasets are down-loaded from the digital platform OPUS3 (Tiede-mann, 2009). Expert RecruitmentWe work with bilingualspeakers to ensure our methods and data faithfullyrepresent the processes associated with translationunder concept variation. For each language, we re-cruit from Prolific4 three annotators who are fluentEnglish speakers and native speakers of the targetlanguage. All annotators are paid $16 USD / hour.5",
  "Identifying Concepts with Variations": "We first identify concepts that are represented as asingle word in our source language (English) buthave several variations in a target language. Webuild upon Chaudhary et al. (2021)s approach toidentify fine-grained lexical distinctions that arisedue to concept variation. Given a parallel corpus,we lemmatize all words using Stanza (Qi et al.,2020) and compute word alignments for each sen-tence pair with the AWESOME aligner (Dou andNeubig, 2021). Using these alignments, we cre-ate a one-to-many mapping from source-languagelexemes to target-language lexemes. Lastly, weremove source lexemes that do not map to at leasttwo target lexemes, exhibit low entropy, or corre-spond to target lexemes that arise due to polysemy.6 While this approach was originally designed andapplied to Spanish and Greek parallel corpora, weapply it to nine additional languages. liststhe total number of extracted concepts for eachlanguage.We also perform comprehensive analysis of thisapproachs precision and recall in identifying target-language variations of concepts. All three expertannotators for each language provide feedback onthe extracted variations, including whether eachvariation matches the meaning of the English lex-eme (for computing precision) and whether any keyvariations are missing from the set (for computingrecall). Precision is measured as the proportionof accurate variations; recall is measured as theproportion of concepts with all key variations re-covered.7 In general, the precision of identifiedvariations is very high, even for low-resource lan-",
  "Dataset Construction": "Our goal is to collect a dataset of sentence pairsthat require understanding target-language conceptvariation for accurate translation. Expert annotatorshelp us curate this dataset by performing the lexi-cal selection task, provided only source-languagesentences and target lexemes.All annotators for a given language are presentedwith the same set of concepts and source-languagesentences. We shuffle the order in which concepts,sentences, and target lexemes are shown to eachannotator. Our resulting dataset, DTAiLS, includessentences for which the majority of annotators se-lected the variation used in the original sentencepair, which indicates that there is sufficient con-text for consistent lexical selection. Although therecould be cases of context-dependent translationwhere there isnt a single optimal lexical variation,for our dataset we rely on majority agreement toselect examples that are clearly evaluable. includes dataset statistics.8"
