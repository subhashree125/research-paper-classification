  "Abstract": "Empathy serves as a cornerstone in enablingprosocial behaviors, and can be evoked throughsharing of personal experiences in stories.While empathy is influenced by narrative con-tent, intuitively, people respond to the way astory is told as well, through narrative style.Yet the relationship between empathy and nar-rative style is not fully understood. In this work,we empirically examine and quantify this re-lationship between style and empathy usingLLMs and large-scale crowdsourcing studies.We introduce a novel, theory-based taxonomy,HEART (Human Empathy and Narrative Taxon-omy) that delineates elements of narrative stylethat can lead to empathy with the narrator of astory. We establish the performance of LLMsin extracting narrative elements from HEART,showing that prompting with our taxonomyleads to reasonable, human-level annotationsbeyond what prior lexicon-based methods cando. To show empirical use of our taxonomy,we collect a dataset of empathy judgments ofstories via a large-scale crowdsourcing studywith N = 2, 624 participants.1 We show thatnarrative elements extracted via LLMs, in par-ticular, vividness of emotions and plot volume,can elucidate the pathways by which narra-tive style cultivates empathy towards personalstories. Our work suggests that such modelscan be used for narrative analyses that lead tohuman-centered social and behavioral insights.",
  ": Narrative empathy can be evoked through theway a story is told (narrative style). This work intro-duces HEART, a theory-driven taxonomy of narrativeelements that contribute to empathy": "beyond the content of the story alone delivery,context, and reader characteristics all contributeto the emotional resonance of a narrative. Moststudies of narrative empathy and its related con-structs focus on reader characteristics,and contentof a story (Sharma et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2023).However, intuitively, people also respond to theway a story is told, or the stylistic devices usedwithin a narrative ().2 A key challenge in narrative analysis within theNLP community is that extracting stylistic featuresrelevant to empathy is not trivial. Prior works useword-count-based (e.g., lexica; Roshanaei et al.,2019; Zhou et al., 2021) or hand-crafted featureson extremely limited story sets (Kuzmicov et al.,2017; Fernandez-Quintanilla, 2020; Fernandez-Quintanilla and Stradling, 2023; Eekhof et al.,2023; Mangen et al., 2018; Hartung et al., 2016) toquantify narrative elements. However, more com-plex stylistic narrative devices, such as plot shifts(Nabi and Green, 2015) or vividness of emotions 2Note that our definition of narrative style may differslightly from pure traditional stylistics. Aspects of style arenaturally intertwined with the content of a story, but our tax-onomy focuses more on the ways in which certain contentare expressed (for example, rather than focusing on whatemotion is present in the story, targeting instead the vividnessof emotional language). (Pillemer, 1992) are harder to summarize with lex-ica alone. While a few works have explored usingLLMs for more complex narrative analysis tasks(Zhu et al., 2023; Michelmann et al., 2023; Sapet al., 2022), to what extent LLMs can effectivelymodel stylistic devices, and how LLM-extractedfeatures might be leveraged for downstream socialinsights, remains underexplored.In this work, we fill this gap by presenting thefollowing contributions. (1) We introduce HEART(Human Empathy and Narrative Taxonomy), atheory-driven taxonomy of narrative style elementsthat relate to empathy. (2) We use LLMs to quantifyaspects of narrativity in our taxonomy and evaluatehow well LLMs represent these elements in linewith human judgments. For a subset of narrativeelements with available lexica, we compare lexicalmeasures with LLM measures, finding that in mostcases, GPT-4 and Llama 3 outperform lexica. (3)Through a human study of N = 2, 624 participants,we introduce a new crowdsourced dataset (HEART-felt Stories Dataset) of empathetic reactions to per-sonal narratives, including annotated narrative styleelements, reader characteristics and narrative reac-tions. (4) With our dataset, we conduct an analysisof pathways through narrative style and reader char-acteristics leading to empathy, demonstrating thevalue of HEART in exploring empirical behavioralinsights around narrative empathy. In particular, wefind that narrative styles with heightened vividnessof emotions, character development and action, andplot volume, are tied to narrative empathy. We ad-ditionally show that empathy is personalized, withhigh variability even for the same story, and thatbeyond narrative style, factors like a readers traitempathy and similarity of experiences to the narra-tor also significantly impact empathy.",
  "Related Work": "Computational linguistic methods can be used toanalyze many aspects of narrativity across a largecorpus of stories (Sap et al., 2022). Prior workshave used lexicon-based approaches to extractpsychologically-grounded word categories and re-late these to empathy (Roshanaei et al., 2019; Xiaoet al., 2016). Zhou et al. (2021) use linguistic stylefeatures such as degree of interdependent thinkingand integrative complexity (the ability of a per-son to recognize multiple perspectives and con-nect them) to predict a viewers empathy towardsa specific situation. Antoniak et al. (2019) ap- ply narrative analysis techniques to birth storiesonline, and show patterns of affective and event-based sequences over time. More recently, Yadenet al. (2024) used linguistic features, such as wordphrases and topics, and leveraged LDA to analyzelanguage that separates more empathetic peoplefrom more compassionate people, showing thatcompassionate people use more other-focused lan-guage than empathetic people. Other works lever-age recent natural language processing (NLP) meth-ods to predict empathy and prosociality from text(Shen et al., 2023; Buechel et al., 2018; Sharmaet al., 2020; Bao et al., 2021), but do not explorepathways via which readers feel empathy.A few works have explored the power of LLMsin characterizing aspects of narrative. In partic-ular, Michelmann et al. (2023) show that LLMsserve as good approximations of human annota-tors in narrative event segmentation. Other worksshow that LLMs achieve reasonable performanceon character profiling tasks for fictional narratives,particularly in factual consistency and motivationunderstanding. However, Subbiah et al. (2024)indicate that LLMs fail to perform authentic sum-marization of stories in line with feedback fromwriters, apart from successfully drawing on the-matic components of the stories. Ultimately, LLMsdemonstrate growing potential for narrative under-standing tasks (Zhu et al., 2023), but how well theyperform, what types of tasks they succeed in, andhow they can reveal human behavioral insights, isan active area of research (Agnew et al., 2024).Our work leverages LLMs to extract narrativestyle elements that may play a role in narrative em-pathy through our grounded taxonomy. We evalu-ate the performance of prompting LLMs to extractsuch elements against expert human raters. Ourempirical study using LLM-extracted narrative ele-ments focuses more on the scientific and behavioralquestion of how to untangle aspects of narrativestyle and reader characteristics to understand theircontribution towards empathy, rather than improv-ing performance on empathy prediction alone.",
  "Narrative Style and its Role in Empathy.Priorworks have theorized how shifts in narrative styleimpact empathic effect of a story. Keen (2006) pro-": "posed a theory of narrative empathy that draws onnarrative techniques to enhance empathy, such asflatness or roundness of a character, the charactersmode of consciousness, and vivid use of settings.van Krieken et al. (2017) presented a framework oflinguistic cues to measure identification with nar-rative characters, including character dimensionssuch as the emotional or perceptual subject of thestory. This framework covers both background el-ements of a story, which can facilitate immersiveexperiences, and foregrounded elements (such asfigurative language), which facilitate aesthetic ex-periences with the text (Jacobs, 2015).However, many of these narrative techniques,particularly those that are more abstract in nature,such as plot structure or emotional shifts (Nabiand Green, 2015), have yet to be tested empiri-cally. Researchers in narratology have exploredthe impact of literary quality on reader empa-thy, varying aspects such as foregrounding, pointof view/viewpoint words, emotion and discoursepresentation, and characterisation techniques, buthave found mixed results in small-scale studies(Kuzmicov et al., 2017; Fernandez-Quintanilla,2020; Fernandez-Quintanilla and Stradling, 2023;Eekhof et al., 2023; Mangen et al., 2018; Hartunget al., 2016). Other studies have looked at howaspects of literary reading contribute to transporta-tion, or the ability to absorb in a narrative, whichfurther predicts empathy towards a story (Walk-ington et al., 2020; van Laer et al., 2014, 2019).Koopman (2015) conducted a larger-scale study toinvestigate the role of genre, personal factors, andaffective responses on both empathic understandingand pro-social behavior, finding that genre affectedprosocial behaviors. However, narrative style en-compasses many aspects beyond genre alone, andeach of these elements couples with one another toenhance or diminish narrative empathy. Reader Characteristics and Narrative Empathy.While narrative style can have an effect on empathy,other factors such as the readers characteristics orexperiences during reading can affect empathy aswell. For example, psychology, economics, andneuroscience have suggested that gender has a sig-nificant influence on peoples cognitive empathy,with women exhibiting higher cognitive empathythan men across a variety of age groups (Christov-Moore et al., 2014; Michalska et al., 2013; Obrienet al., 2013). Levels of narrative empathy can alsobe modulated by ones trait empathy level (Kon- rath et al., 2018), emotional state during reading(Roshanaei et al., 2019), or general exposure toliterature (Mar et al., 2006). Untangling the effectsof these fixed can be challenging, and has beenattempted by a few prior works, but with varied re-sults (Koopman and Hakemulder, 2015; Fernandez-Quintanilla, 2020; Roshanaei et al., 2019).In our work, we propose a taxonomy of narra-tive empathy based on theories and empirical re-sults presented in the aforementioned works, thenscientifically explore what pathways through bothnarrative style and reader characteristics and lifeexperiences and to overall empathy towards a story.In contrast to prior works, which often vary a singleelement of narrative style, we construct a thoroughtaxonomy of narrative elements related to empathy.",
  "HEART Taxonomy for Empathy andNarrative Style": "Based on the aforementioned theoretical and em-pirical research, we propose HEART, a taxonomyof narrative style elements that can lead to empathy.In A Theory of Narrative Empathy, Keen positsthat aspects of characterization, narrative situation,internal perspective, and techniques to representcharacter consciousness can contribute to narrativeempathy. We use these concepts as precursors fordeveloping HEART. Our theoretical model servesas a starting point for understanding what aspectsof narrative characteristics might lead to empathyand how we can measure these factors using com-putational approaches. shows our full taxonomy, which delin-eates narrative style as it relates to narrative empa-thy via four main categories: (1) Character identifi-cation (2) Plot (3) Point of view and (4) Setting. Inthe remainder of this section, we outline each ele-ment of our taxonomy and the theoretical and em-pirical roots of how each element may contributeto narrative empathy. Character IdentificationWe refer to characteridentification elements as story aspects that drawreaders into the narrators perspective, whether thisbe across internal dimensions (emotion/cognition)or external dimensions (perception/time). We de-fine 6 high-level elements of our taxonomy thatcan contribute to identification with a characterin a story, primarily rooted in (van Krieken et al.,2017)s work on character identification:",
  ". Resolution (Mcadams, 2006) captures the re-lease of tension after the main conflict that acharacter experiences": "Point of viewPrior works suggest that point ofview can affect empathy towards a narrator (Eekhofet al., 2023; Fernandez-Quintanilla, 2020; Spitaleet al., 2022). For example, first-person perspectivecan emphasize the personal nature of the story anddraw readers into the shoes of the narrator. SettingFinally, the environment and context ofthe narrator can facilitate narrative empathy (Pille-mer, 1992; van Krieken et al., 2017), for examplethrough world-building to enhance narrative trans-portation. We capture this element via the vividnessof the setting description in a narrative.",
  "Story Dataset": "To empirically observe the narrative elements ofHEART, we started with a seed dataset of personalnarratives from theEMPATHICSTORIES (Shenet al., 2023) and the EMPATHICSTORIES++ (Shenet al., 2024) dataset, which were specifically de-signed to include meaningful and vulnerable per-sonal stories with diverse narrators, shared acrossdiverse topics (e.g. relationships, mental health,career and school, etc.). The EMPATHICSTORIES",
  "Bodily sensations3.7960.3334.25": ": Agreement between 2 expert human annotatorson the narrative elements of our taxonomy. Scores aremultiplied by 100 and rounded for readability and sortedby KA. Spearmans correlation indicates significance. dataset consists of 1,500 personal narratives col-lected from social media sites (Facebook, Reddit),crowdsourced personal narratives, and transcribedpodcasts. The EMPATHICSTORIES++ dataset con-tains 500 conversational personal stories thatwere automatically transcribed from storytellinginteractions with an AI. We filtered stories to re-move potentially harmful topics (e.g. mentions ofsexual assault, excessive swearing), and filtered sto-ries that were under 200 words (which might notcontain rich narrative style elements), resulting ina final dataset of 874 personal stories.",
  "Expert Narrative Style Annotation": "We randomly sampled 50 stories from our finaldataset of 874 stories to obtain expert annotationsof the narrative elements and validate LLM per-formance on the task. We selected a subset of 12narrative elements from our taxonomy that are non-trivial to extract from existing NLP toolkits, andwhich required human judgments given the sub-jectivity of the task. Three independent membersof our research team with expertise in text analy-sis and annotation iteratively designed a codebook(Appendix C) with instructions and examples forgauging the presence of each element.Subsequently, two independent expert annota-tors rated the presence of each of the 12 narra-tive elements in the 50 sampled stories. shows the agreement between the 2 raters usingKrippendorfs alpha (KA), percent pairwise agree-ment (PPA), and Spearmans correlation (). Allratings are positively correlated to each other, butdifferent narrative elements have varying degreesof agreement. We observe the lowest agreementbetween human annotators for TEMPORAL REFER- ENCES and BODILY SENSATIONS, where irrealisevents and mentions of body sensations across mul-tiple characters caused confusion. Moreover, whilesome human agreements may appear low usingthe KA metric, these scores are consistent withprior NLP tasks with more subjectivity (Shen et al.,2023; Rashkin et al., 2018; Sap et al., 2017). Inour subsequent empirical analysis, we do not usefeatures with low agreement (below 0.2 KA).",
  "LLMs for Narrative Style Extraction": "Our work explores how LLM-extracted narrativefeatures can be used to yield empirical social in-sights around empathy and storytelling. As such,we validate whether LLMs are capable of narrativestyle annotations in line with expert human judg-ments. To this end, we prompt GPT-43 and theinstruction-tuned variant of Llama 3 8B4 with thesame instructions and codebook given to humanannotators (Appendix C). In , we reportagreement between averaged human ratings andthe LLM-based ratings on the same 50 sampledstories.We observe similar patterns in agreement be-tween GPT-4 and human raters as we do in agree-ment between our two expert annotators. GPT-4provides ratings with substantial agreement for nar-rative features such as CHARACTER VULNERABIL- ITY, OPTIMISTIC TONE, and RESOLUTION. Formost features, the GPT-4 ratings are more posi-tively correlated with human annotations than arethe Llama 3 ratings. As such, we use GPT-4 toextract the narrative elements for all the remain-ing stories in our corpus and exclude features thathave low agreement with human gold labels in oursubsequent empirical study.",
  "Performance of LLMs vs. Lexica": "As prior works use lexica (Roshanaei et al., 2019;Zhou et al., 2021) to quantify narrative elements,we compare whether GPT-4 and Llama 3 can out-perform psychologically validated lexica in captur-ing features of HEART. We select 4 dimensionsin our taxonomy that readily map to lexicon-baseddimensions in LIWC-22 (Boyd, 2022; Pennebakeret al., 1999) and compare correlation to humanexpert ratings in . We find that GPT-4-extracted features for OPTIMISTIC TONE, VIVID",
  "Error Analysis": "We observe that GPT-4 consistently over-ratesthe level of EVALUATIONS and COGNITION ex-pressed in a story as compared to human anno-tators. Through qualitative examples of storieswhere GPT-4 and human disagreements are large(Appendix D), GPT-4 typically conflates emotionalreactions with evaluations, attributions, or desires(e.g. ...it really got me thinking about when Ifirst went to College...How excited my parents werefor me and scared. And I was both excited andscared...). For COGNITION errors, we see thatthese systematic errors are typically due to GPT-4conflating recollection with demonstrations of cog-nition when overall, the story did not contain moreinternal thinking processes.Regarding Llama 3, we observe that when hu-man annotators and GPT-4 agree, but Llama 3 dis-agrees, it tends to assign higher scores to a minority of features (e.g., CHARACTER VULNERABILITY)while giving lower scores to a majority of features(e.g., VIVID EMOTIONS, VIVID SETTING). Thelower ratings for imagery-related features suggesta lesser adeptness with figurative language.Ultimately, our validation study demonstratesthat LLMs in particular, GPT-4 can approximateextracting narrative elements relevant to empathyas corroborated by prior work (Shen et al., 2023;Ziems et al., 2024), but some features are morechallenging for the model to identify. We show inthe following section that GPT-4 narrative ratingsstill reveal interesting behavioral insights aroundnarrative empathy, even without perfect agreement.",
  "Human Study for Measuring Empathy": "To demonstrate the empirical use of our taxonomyand how extracted narrative elements can be used toexplore behavioral insights around narrative empa-thy, we conduct a large-scale user study presentingstories to different participants and asking them torate their empathy towards the story. In this sec-tion, we discuss our study participants, the taskprocedure, and our data collection and measuresused.",
  "Our study procedure was determined exempt byour institutions ethics review board. At the begin-ning of the study, participants rated their current": "emotional state (arousal/valence), before reading apersonal story. After reading the story, they wereasked to rate their empathy towards the story, andto check which of the narrative elements within ourtaxonomy based on which elements contributedmost to their emotional reaction towards the story.We asked a qualitative, open-ended question ask-ing what aspects of the narratives style made themrelate to the story.After this, we asked participants to answer ques-tions related to (1) narrative-reader interaction ef-fects, which encompass reader factors that are tiedto the process of reading the narrative (narrativetransportation, prior experience with somethingthat happened in the story, and perceived similar-ity to the narrator, and (2) reader characteristics(age, gender, ethnicity, trait empathy, how oftenthey read for pleasure, fluent languages, and edu-cation level). Survey measurements and reasoningfor selecting such measurements are detailed in thefollowing section. All participants were paid $1for answering the survey, and participants spenton average 7 minutes completing the entire task.Each of the 874 stories was rated at least 3 times byindependent readers, resulting in 2,624 empatheticreactions to stories in total.",
  "Data Collection and Measures": "Our user study aims to capture empathy towards adiverse set of narratives with a diverse set of partici-pants with varying reader characteristics in additionto variables that might moderate the effect of narra-tive style on empathy. Based on related empiricalwork exploring factors related to empathy (), we designed the following surveys (all surveysare included in Appendix E for reproducibility).We make our dataset publicly available to open updeeper research in narrative empathy analysis. Empathy and Narrative Style PreferencesWemeasure empathy towards the story through theState Empathy Scale (Shen, 2010). To gauge nar-rative style preferences, participants check off rel-evant elements from our taxonomy that they feltcontributed to empathy towards the story. In addi-tion, we ask for qualitative free-response feedbackon what narrative style elements contributed to em-pathy towards the story.",
  "Narrative-Reader Interaction EffectsWe de-fine effects at the intersection of reader characteris-tics and the experience of reading the narrative asnarrative-reader interaction effects. These include": ": Visualization of how narrative style elementsand reader characteristics influence the experience areader has with a narrative (narrative-reader interactioneffects). All of these components combined in turninfluence downstream narrative empathy. (1) narrative transportation, measured by the Trans-portation Scale Short-Form / TS-SF (Appel et al.,2015; Walkington et al., 2020) , (2) prior experi-ence, measured by a Likert scale of how much thereader believes they have been in a similar situa-tion as the narrator, and (3) perceived similarity tothe narrator, measured by the Perceived RelationalDiversity Scale (Clark, 2002). These features allowus to better understand the pathways via how narra-tive style elements interplay with narrative-readerinteractions to lead to downstream empathy. Reader CharacteristicsWe collect reader char-acteristics based on comprehensive literature re-view of properties that are related to empathy.These features include (1) the emotional state of thereader before reading the story, measured by thearousal/valence scale (Roshanaei et al., 2019), (2)basic demographic information including age, gen-der, ethnicity (Christov-Moore et al., 2014; Michal-ska et al., 2013; Obrien et al., 2013), (3) how of-ten participants read for pleasure (Koopman, 2015;Mar et al., 2006), and (4) trait empathy, measuredby the Single Item Trait Empathy Scale / SITES(Konrath et al., 2018) and the Toronto EmpathyQuestionnaire / TEQ (Spreng et al., 2009). Prolificautomatically provides additional demographic in-formation on participants such as fluent languages,nationality, and employment and student status.",
  ": Comparing average empathy across high vslow presence of each narrative feature, we show thatthere are significant increases in empathy for storieswith more character development and plot volume": "the mean across the 3 raters. Then, we split sto-ries into high vs. low presence of each narrativefeature and apply Mann-Whitney u-tests to the aver-aged state empathy for the stories. showsthat high aggregated empathy stories have morecharacter development and plot volume. Theseresults are statistically significant, after applyingBenjamini-Hochberg correction to account for ninecomparisons (p = 0.03 for character development,p = 0.03 for plot trajectory).Our work is, to the best of our knowledge, thefirst to empirically test the effect of character de-velopment and plot volume on narrative empathy.While some prior works (van Krieken et al., 2017)propose narrative features that relate to characteridentification, these are lower level than charac-ter development, such as the flatness/roundness orvulnerability of a character. Our findings regard-ing plot volume are in line with prior works thatdiscuss how salient plot events can mark impor-tant moments in narratives that influence the emo-tional impact of the story (Sap et al., 2022). Priorworks primarily from narrative studies use hand-crafted features on smaller story sets (Fernandez-Quintanilla, 2020; Eekhof et al., 2023), but do not find significant effects of narrative features suchas viewpoint and foregrounding. These studies fo-cus primarily on literary texts rather than narrativesthat are more common online, and do not take intoaccount other aspects of narrative style and narra-tive traits that are a part of our theorized taxonomy.These findings suggest future focused works, forexample looking at how narrative style relates toempathy across narrative forms (literary vs. per-sonal stories, spoken vs. textual, etc.) Narrative Empathy is not One Size Fits AllWhile our previous analysis captures aggregatedempathy, different people can have diverse emo-tional reactions to the same story. In (Ap-pendix B), we show the standard deviations in stateempathy scores for the same story, finding that onaverage this std. dev. is significantly greater thanzero (p < 0.001), indicating that the same nar-rative can evoke different levels of empathy. Toaddress within-subject variance, we fit mixed ef-fects models of empathy ratings using demographicgroups, grouping individuals of similar Age, Sex,Trait Empathy, and Ethnicity and conditioning onmultiple ratings for a single story. We find througha likelihood ratio test that empathy predicted bydemographic group results in significantly bettermodel fit (p = 0.002). These two results indi-cate that there is high variance in empathy for thesame story and that incorporating information re-garding diverse demographic profiles can improveempathy model fit, aligning with prior works (Au-gust et al., 2020). Our findings have implicationsin broader empathy prediction tasks within NLP(Buechel et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2020), whichoften optimize for a single objective empathy scoreassigned to a piece of text, aggregating empathywhich can overlook individual factors. Vivid Emotional Expression of Narratives Leadsto Narrative EmpathyGiven our finding thatnarrative empathy is not one size fits all, we con-duct analyses taking into account random effectsfor each story ID with structural equation model-ing using the semopy library6. Structural equa-tion modeling (SEM) is a standard social sciencemethod for structured hypothesis testing and usesa formulation of generalized linear models to ac-count for fixed and random effects when a theoreti-cal model with relationships between elements isproposed. From our SEM results (), we find thatvividness of emotions significantly impacts nar-rative transportation, which in turn influencesdownstream empathy towards the story. Theimportance of vividness of emotions in personalstories is supported by other work in psychology.In particular, Pillemer (1992) elaborates that vividdescriptions of emotion in personal stories can con-vey believability in the experience, more readilyevoking empathetic responses. While some compu-tational works explore impact of narrative featureson empathy (Roshanaei et al., 2019), they typicallyfocus on positive/negative emotion words, ratherthan the narrative style or way in which emotionsare conveyed through text, and may be better cap-tured by current large-language models. shows how narrative features contributeto narrative transportation, leading to downstreamempathy and taking into account non-stylistic fac-tors like the reader sharing a similar experience asthe narrator and the readers trait empathy level.We find that both the narrators previous expe-rience with something happening in the story aswell as their baseline trait empathy are signif-icant predictors of empathy towards the story,but not as much as narrative transportation. Inparticular, our findings are in line with appraisaltheory that suggests that feeling similar emotionsis predicated on the target sharing similar expe-riences (Wondra and Ellsworth, 2015; Yang andJurgens, 2024). While it is not particularly surpris-ing that similar experience correlates with empa-thy, very few works have looked at narrative styleinteractions in tandem with fixed (trait empathy)and more dynamic traits (experiencing somethingsimilar), suggesting more holistic consideration ofcontextual factors related to narrative empathy. Narrative Style Preferences in Relation to Empa-thy are PersonalizedFinally, we show differentdemographic profiles might prefer different ways oftelling a story, where preference is gauged by nar-rative empathy. Adding the interaction term TRAITEMPATHY VIVIDNESS OF EMOTIONS to ourstructural model, we find a significant interactioneffect of vivid emotions on the state empathy (est= 0.252, p < 0.001). This indicates that the rela-tionship between vividness of emotions and stateempathy increases as trait empathy increases,suggesting that narrative style preferences arepersonalized across demographic profiles.While certainly not exhaustive, our empiricalanalyses show how HEART can be used to yieldinteresting behavioral insights around how narra-tive style contributes to empathy. In particular, wenote that looking at personalization in narrativeempathy, as well as contextualizing reader factorssuch as their trait empathy level are important forempathy prediction, and are often overlooked inexisting empathy tasks.",
  "Conclusion": "In this work, we quantify narrative style as it relatesto narrative empathy. We introduce HEART, thefirst theory-driven taxonomy delineating elementsof narrative style that can evoke empathy towards astory. We evaluate the performance of LLMs in ex-tracting narrative elements from HEART, showingthat prompting GPT-4 with our taxonomy leads toreasonable, human-level annotations beyond whatprior lexicon-based methods can do, but that LLMsstruggle in specific tasks, such as GPT-4s limitedability to extract expressions of cognition and eval-uations. Through a crowdsourced study with over2,000 participants, we demonstrate how HEARTcan be used to empirically understand the empathicrole of narrative style factors. We find that vivid-ness of emotions expressed, character developmentand plot volume are related to narrative empathy,and contextual factors such as a persons baselinetrait empathy or sharing an experience with the nar-rator contribute to these effects. Additionally, weshow that empathy responses are highly variableeven in the same story, and that narrative style pref-erences are personalized to people with differentdemographic profiles (such as varying levels of traitempathy). Our findings show the promise of usingLLMs for annotating complex story features thatcan yield interesting social and behavioral insights.",
  "Limitations": "Narrative Style AnnotationWhile most of thefeatures in our taxonomy yielded reasonable con-sistency across human and LLM annotators, a fewelements such as bodily perception and evaluationswere less consistent. We excluded these featuresfrom our empirical analysis, but future work couldmake improvements to the annotation process forthese specific elements. For example, our code-book makes use of Likert scale ratings for eachof the narrative features within an entire story, butmore granular annotations such as frequency ofoccurrences may have more consistency. Empirical Study Size and ReproducibilityFindings in human behavior should be reproducibleacross different populations and contexts. Whilewe conducted a large scale study with many partic-ipants, we did not ask participants to rate multiplestories. Additionally, the demographic distributionof Prolific crowdworkers is predominantly white.Future work should aim to reproduce our empiri-cal insights with diverse populations and differenttypes of stories. Statistical ModelingOur analysis methods in-volve interpretable statistical models commonlyused in social science research. We chose to usestructural equation modeling to gauge behavioralinsights around how narrative style contributes toempathy, rather than achieving the best perfor-mance on narrative empathy prediction. Futurework could improve upon narrative empathy pre-diction by incorporating narrative features in morecomplex transformer-based models and ablatingdifferent features.",
  "Ethical Considerations": "Personal stories can contain intimate and vulnera-ble information, in addition to inducing emotionsin readers. Our study protocol for showing sensi-tive stories to crowdworkers was approved by ourinstitutions ethics review board as an exempt study.Participants gave informed consent that their surveyratings would be collected via Prolific. We ensuredthat all datasets we used were also collected viaIRB-approved protocols, and will only distributeour dataset to IRB-approved protocols.More broadly, our work aims to advance re-search in narrative analysis as it relates to real-world human outcomes, such as empathy. Our findings corroborate that empathy is a highly per-sonalized and contextualized experience. As such,in future work, we find that, rather than modelingthe average person, it is important to value the richdiversity of human experiences.We recognize the ethical implications of model-ing empathy in stories is double-edged. Empathycan be used in persuasion, marketing, or emotionalmanipulation. We encourage the findings from ourwork, and future work on narrative empathy anal-ysis, to focus on improving human empathy forsocial good. For example, one could develop in-teractive tools to help a user convey a story moreempathetically through understanding the role ofnarrative devices in reader empathy. Or one coulduse these insights to understand, at scale, socialpatterns behind storytelling, and how these mightdrive empathetic shifts online. We would like to thank all of our participants andteammates for their invaluable contributions to thisproject.

  "C.1Character development": "We define character development in terms ofchanges that a character undergoes through thecourse of narrative events.We define changes broadly to include cognitive,emotional, behavioral, spiritual, moral, bodily, andsocial changes.Notably, we do not consider environmentalchanges for characters sufficient for character de-velopment, but acknowledge that other types ofchange (e.g. emotional, social) often accompanyor are caused by environmental changes.",
  "I watched the birds splashing in the puddlefrom a bench at the park. They were so playfuland content, even as it started to drizzle. (1 -character does not change)": "It wasnt until my brother told me what hesbeen going through that I realized how distantI had been. I broke down in front of him at thetime. From that day forward, I decided to bethere for my family, no matter whateven ifthat meant quitting my job and moving home.(5 - multiple dramatic changes)",
  "C.6Temoral references": "Rate the extent to which the character focuses onthe past (such as expressing nostalgia or reflectionson memories) vs on the future (anticipation, look-ing forward) in the context of the story.Note that we are not asking whether the storyis a past-tense, present-tense, or future-tense story.We are concerned with the orientation the narrator",
  "C.7Plot volume": "Stories are structured by a sequence of events.We define plot trajectory as the amount and sig-nificance of events in the story.If the events are banal or insignificant and donot have a big impact on characters, then the plottrajectory is relatively small. If the events signifi-cantly impact characters or setting, then the storyhas a large plot trajectory.Rate the degree to which characters and settingare transformed through the course of the storybased on the following scale:",
  "C.8Emotion shifts": "Most (but not all) emotions have either a positive(high) or negative (low) valence.For example, anger and disgust are low va-lence, whereas happy and content are highvalence.Other emotions like ambivalent or surprisedcould be neutral, low, high, or ambiguous depend-ing on the context.We consider 5 different types of emotional shiftsthat can occur in a story:",
  "C.9Resolution": "In the course of events and interactions betweencharacters, stories introduce conflict. Stories alsoraise questions about the motives of characters, themeaning of events, and more. Conflict can be ex-plicitly or implicitly referenced by narrators. Al-ternatively, the reader may subjectively perceiveconflict in the situations described by narrators.Resolution refers to the extent to which conflictis addressed and questions are answered by the endof the story. There are many ways a story may beresolved, partially or completely. Resolution canoccur for the narrator, characters within the story,or the reader.A story with low resolution may not have muchconflict or leave conflict unaddressed by the end ofthe story. A story with high resolution will involveconflict that is addressed or raise questions that areultimately answered.Rate the degree of resolution by the end of thestory based on the following scale:",
  "Yeah, so this is the beginning of the schoolyear, and Ive seen a lot of people moving intotheir dorms and apartments, and it really got methinking about when I first went to College, when": "I was moving into the dorm. How excited myparents were for me and scared. And I was bothexcited and scared, moving away from home andmy parents, and knowing that Id probably getreally homesick. Watching all those kids movingin really made me think about how that felt forme. It was really important for me, there was a lotof pressure for me to do well in College becausemy dad came here from a developing countryand wasnt able to get an education past secondgrade. I was the first person in my family to goto College, and to make it that far. So I had a lotof emotions, definitely some anxiety, some stressabout the pressure of performing and doing well.But also the excitement, and kind of the normalfear that you get doing something youve neverdone before and not having parents who had neverexperienced College like that before. I didnt reallyhave anyone to go to, to understand what thatmeant, like what to expect. So watching those kidsjust brought me back to that moment.=================Human: 0.25GPT-4: 1.0 When covid first hit I had to move from my cityto my home town. Wasnt a huge deal as it was forothers. It was a year and a half and a lot happenedand eventually I came back to my original town,new fiance and cat in tow. I couldnt find a jobonce I came back and when I did that place got shutdown. My fiance did have one, but any paycheck hehad didnt go to our shared place, mostly his phonebill or groceries once in a while, while he stayedout till 2 am drinking. So I started. Excessively.I dont know now how I did, it was only a fewmonths ago, how I managed to. I borrowed fromfamily or friends, I took out loans to make sure rentwas paid. It got so bad I was hospitalized for twoweeks because for over a day I was throwing upevery hour. I had torn my esophagus. No food. Myfiance didnt visit, saying he was scared, but hisaunt visited. I cried every night.When I got home he was working, he came backand was clearly drinking. The next day my mothertexted me telling me she was disappointed in medrinking so much I got myself in that situation. Isaw that and realized when I was in the hospital,alone, afraid, and not wanting to live like this. Thusme and my mother didnt speak for months.Family stuff happened, got back in touch. Weboth never apologized but theres a whole lot of cans there to be opened. I ruined relationships Icant take back. Lost contact with friends.After this stint my anxiety has been on high alert,making it hard for me to eat or even drink water.Public transit has been scary as I do have thoseimpulse \"what if I ran on the track\" thoughts whichI know are ridiculous.Thankfully now I do have a job I enjoy, I havemy cat, my own place I pay rent.=================Human: 0.25GPT-4: 1.0 About four months ago, my wife and I sold ourfirst family home. We have a large family. It is mywife and I plus five children. Our oldest daughterstarted asking us about having her own room. Al-though we loved that house, we knew it was timeto get something bigger.Luckily, we sold it after being on the marketfor only three days. We found a house with morebedrooms quickly, and the whole process was assmooth as it could have been.However, it is bittersweet looking back on every-thing. That house was very special to me. I did alot of work on it. I saw my children grow and learnand love there. We made so many good memories.We charted how our children grew on a closet door(which is probably still there). It was a wonderfulhouse while it lasted, but things happen and we hadto let it go.As of today, I can still remember every littlenook and cranny of that place. After all, it has onlybeen a few months. However, it is sad to thinkthese memories will eventually fade.I love our new house, but that first one willalways hold a special place in my heart.=================Human: 0.0GPT-4: 1.0 A couple months ago my younger brother gotmarried. I traveled back to my home town of St.Louis, Missouri for the event. I took my girlfriendalong with me. It was her first trip to my hometown ever. The trip started out great, we picked upour rental car and went to grab a pizza.The following day was my brothers weddingceremony. We thought it had all been plannedout thoroughly, but it turns out that nobody hadchecked the weather report. The day of the wed-ding came, it started out sunny, a hot day in late July. Clear blue skies and not a cloud to be seen.We were all so optimistic about the big day. Theceremony was scheduled for 6 PM at sunset, so itwould start to cool down and allow for some re-prieve from the heat of the day. In theory, that wasa great idea.However, when my girlfriend and I pulled outof the driveway we noticed something new that wehadnt seen yet on the trip. Storm clouds movingin fast, and lots of them. Dark gray giants roseonto the horizon at a frightening pace. Lightningwas visible in the distance as we began our driveto the wedding venue. We hoped and prayed thatthe storm would blow the other way, and that theoutdoor wedding venue would be spared from thisparticular storm. Would we be able to get awaywith having the ceremony in decent weather?It became a race with time. As we drove tothe wedding ceremony, it felt as though the cloudswere following us and growing larger. As we ar-rived, I greeted my brother in the parking lot andasked if he thought it would rain. He said maybe,it depends how fast we can get this done. Every-one was present except for the minister, one of thefew people who was completely essential to theprocess.As the minister arrived, it finally began torain. It was raining on my brothers wedding day,I couldnt believe it, but luckily the ceremonywas completed and we had a wonderful sunnyreception the next day.=================Human: 0.25GPT-4: 1.0 I was hiking near Lake Ontario with my partnerand our two grandkids. It was a beautiful sunnyday. The lake sparkled brilliantly. I have a badknee, so I was struggling with some of the physicalactivity. My partner suggested that I rest a bit on afallen log. I was nervous, because I would not beable to get up by myself, but I agreed.My partner and my granddaugther wanted tohike further to see the bluffs. I said I would be OKfor a bit, but my sweet grandson insisted on stayingwith me. He said, \"I wont let my granny sit in theforest all alone.\"Well it was a good thing. My partner and grand-daughter didnt return in a reasonable amount oftime. We got very nervous! My grandson is 10years old, but not strong enough to help me up. Hesearched for a stout walking stick and found one nearby. I used it to prop myself up, and managedto get my feet underneath me.Together we went down the shore to find the restof our party. Luckily all was well, but I would trulyhave been distraught if I had been all alone waitingfor so long!",
  "Human: 0.25GPT-4: 1.0": "Ive been hearing a lot of people saying that MITstudents arent successful as Stanford or Harvardstudents because there arent as many well-knownMIT CEOs. It seems rather unfair of them to saythat because MIT students have contributed a lot tothis world from nobel-prize winning theorems togroundbreaking algorithms.Also there are lot of MIT grads like David Siegelwho went on to found great companies that dontnecessarily have a face to the brand like Jobs Ap-ple or Zuckerbergs Facebook. And on top of that,there many of MIT grads who go on to be CTOsor other types of product managers (sorry for theemphasis on course 6), and without them, the com-panies would not be the same.Above all, out of the \"top\" institutions, MIT doesthe most to help lower-income students attain socialand economic mobility (I remember reading anarticle, but cant find the link).This is not to say that MIT doesnt have prob-lems, but at the end of the day, I wish people didntequate fame/status with success. You dont have tobe a famous CEO or a CEO in general to be success-ful. And Im sure a lot of the people I mentioneddidnt end up becoming crazy famous because theyvalue privacy, which is fine!And a lot of alumns end up doing what theyreinterested in regardless of status, which is amazingand also indicative of success! Success can lookdifferent for people.=================Human: 0.25GPT-4: 1.0 When covid first hit I had to move from my cityto my home town. Wasnt a huge deal as it was forothers.

Itstarted early in the day, and my parents came byand picked me up at my house. Everyone was ina very somber mood, but it was sunny and quitewarm. We drove out to a church about thirty min-utes away near where my mom grew up, and whiledriving I couldnt help but think back to all thegood memories I had with my cousin. She wasalways so happy and nice and just fun to be around.But now, that was all gone, and all I had were thememories that were going over in my mind.Arriving at the church and seeing all of my fam-ily, it was hard. It was just so sad, all of it. Seeingmy aunt was the hardest part I think, but I knewthen that she was strong and was going to be ableto get past this. My uncle is an ordained pastor, sohe was able to help with the service and I think thathelped ease some of the pain.After the service we all went to the cemetery and gathered up on the hill in the shade. Seeingthe final resting place really hit me hard, I startedto cry much harder than I had been all day at thatpoint. All of the memories and the final shock tomy brain that she was never coming back, mademe very sad, and made me miss her dearly.We then all met at a local place where theyserved a late lunch and we had some drinks. It wasgood to see so many of my family, but at the sametime, so sad, because I thought that we shouldntbe seeing each other, at least not for this reason.I didnt really know how to feel when we left andI made it back home. I was deeply saddened, andjust thought of how my aunt, uncle, and cousinsfelt. I know that life had changed for them forever,and now life was starting again without their dearone, and that hurt me again. But my family isstrong, and stronger together, and I know we willget through this like we will any other tragedy thatcomes our way.",
