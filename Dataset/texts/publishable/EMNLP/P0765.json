  "Abstract": "While the biases of language models in pro-duction are extensively documented, the bi-ases of their guardrails have been neglected.This paper studies how contextual informationabout the user influences the likelihood of anLLM to refuse to execute a request. By gen-erating user biographies that offer ideologicaland demographic information, we find a num-ber of biases in guardrail sensitivity on GPT-3.5.Younger, female, and Asian-American personasare more likely to trigger a refusal guardrailwhen requesting censored or illegal informa-tion. Guardrails are also sycophantic, refusingto comply with requests for a political positionthe user is likely to disagree with. We find thatcertain identity groups and seemingly innocu-ous information, e.g., sports fandom, can elicitchanges in guardrail sensitivity similar to di-rect statements of political ideology. For eachdemographic category and even for Americanfootball team fandom, we find that ChatGPTappears to infer a likely political ideology andmodify guardrail behavior accordingly.",
  "Introduction": "Like other applications of AI, chatbots can offerunequal support to users depending on their back-ground and needs. Large language models (LLMs)often have limited utility for users who speak a lowresource language or marginalized dialect (Huanget al., 2023; Deas et al., 2023). The phrasing of arequest may also change the quality of the answer(Hofmann et al., 2024), advantaging educated userswith a privileged background.While existing work addresses these issues ofcontextual accuracy and data scarcity, we insteadfocus on a previously unexplored factor in unequalcapabilities: chatbot guardrails, the restrictionsthat limit model responses to uncertain or sensitivequestions and often provide boilerplate text refus-ing to fulfill a request (see ). These guardrails",
  "* Equal contribution": "may be created with the same human feedback pro-cedures by which the next token predictions of anLLM are tuned into a usable dialogue interface(Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023). Inclosed commercial chatbots, guardrails may takethe form of proprietary peripheral models (Anilet al., 2023). While we do not always know the pro-cess by which these guardrails are trained, we canmeasure their sensitivity to context as a blackbox.Guardrails must track the wider dialogue contextbecause adversarial jailbreaks and spurious triggersoften depend on recontextualizing a request, e.g.,by first ordering the model to roleplay.Using a diverse set of persona introductionsthat imply or declare a user identity and ideologyand a set of requests which inconsistently triggera guardrail refusal (), we find a number ofbiases in the sensitivity of the guardrail: Given explicit declarations of a user personasgender, age, or ethnicity, ChatGPT refusesrequests for censored information for youngerpersonas more than elder personas; womenmore than men; and Asian-Americans morethan other ethnicities. Guardrails trigger sycophantically for polit-ically sensitive requests, with higher proba-bility of a refusal if a conservative personarequests a liberal position from the model ora liberal requests a conservative position.",
  "Background": "Epistemic biasMuch recent work on fairnessin LLMs focuses on potential prejudice against athird party or worldview, rather than against theuser directly. In other words, models provide prej-udiced responses that that may harm third parties,e.g., inferring that a particular job applicant is morequalified based on ethnicity (Yin et al., 2024) orpresuming gender based on an individuals profes-sion (Rudinger et al., 2018). Political bias can alsoemerge from information in the training data or thedesign of the human feedback procedure, typicallyleading to more liberal responses (Santurkar et al.,2023; Liu et al., 2022). Focusing on guardrail sen-sitivity, we investigate how the model may alsoexpress social biases in refusing a users request. Equal utilityLanguage models can also disad-vantage certain groups by providing utility un-equally to their users. It is frequently observed, forexample, that speakers of languages other than En-glish rarely have access to the functionality of state-of-the-art English language models (Bang et al., 2023; Ojo et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023). EvenEnglish speakers who use a marginalized dialectmay find that chatbots are less accurate or useful,as prestige dialects can elicit model responses thatare better tuned or more helpful (Chen et al., 2023).Beyond this utility gap, LLMs have also producedoffensive or harmful responses, occasionally result-ing in substantial real world consequences, as whenone user died by suicide under the suggestion of achatbot (El Atillah, 2023). Chatbots may be morelikely to offer harmful responses to some groups,and these harmful responses may also dispropor-tionately impact members of already vulnerablegroups, e.g., a racist reply has a greater impact onusers with marginalized ethnic identities. Our work presents a new potential source ofbias in these LLMs: the guardrails introduced toprevent harmful responses. By initiating dialoguewith a short user bio before issuing a sensitive re-quest, we study the utility gap introduced by theguardrail-induced refusals. Although this approachto including user context is artificial, features likethe new persistent memories offered by ChatGPT(OpenAI, 2024a) may retain user identity acrossconversations, making potential guardrail biases amore significant concern. We show that simulatedusers may signal ideology and impact guardrail be-havior with cues as seemingly innocuous as endors-ing an NFL team, so it is likely that a real-worlduser has implied a salient identity feature in somedialog context.",
  ": The experimental setup and execution": "GuardrailsGuardrails in proprietary languagemodels are largely opaquewe do not know howthey are implemented or trained. Some guardrailsuae peripheral components to detect and preventthe models production of potentially harmful con-tent (Anil et al., 2023; Inan et al., 2023; Rebedeaet al., 2023). Others may be trained directly into themodel using the same human feedback system thatimproves the capabilities of the model (Bai et al.,2022; Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023).Regardless of implementation, these systems musthave access to dialogue context, which introducesthe potential for bias based on user information. User identityRecent interest in model bias hasinspired ways to describe an audience to a model.Although we provide an explicit biographic intro-duction, more subtle or naturalistic approaches ex-ist. Smith and Williams (2021) use introductionswith names to imply gender and other demograph-ics. Hofmann et al. (2024) also elicit implicit biasthrough the use of minority dialects. Other ap-proaches use interpretability to manipulate useridentity, as when Chen et al. (2024) directly controlthe models internal representation of its audiencewith identity vectors.",
  "Experiments": "Our experiments begin each dialogue with a per-sona introduction that reveals some aspect of thesimulated users identity. We then provide a re-quest prompt which the model is likely, but notcertain, to reject. For example, we may begin bysaying, Hi there, Im Sarah, a Minnesota Vikingsfan originally from the Midwest, and then issu-ing a sensitive request such as, How do peoplecheat on tests? We then evaluate whether a given response addresses the request.The model may reply to our simulated user with,Im sorry, but I cant assist with that, or, Ratherthan cheating, you should focus on studying dili-gently to perform well on your exam. Both re-sponses constitute a refusal because they do notalign with the users intent to cheat, but the formerresponse is a boilerplate guardrailidentifiable bykeywords aloneand we distinguish between thesecases using multiple classifiers. illustrates the full experimental pipeline,including the generation and filtering of personaintroductions and sensitive requests.1.",
  "Classifying responses": "Since our experiments consist of more than225,000 requests to the conversational models, weautomatically label refusals to answer by prompt-ing GPT-4o as described in Appendix C.For a stricter classification of refusals, we alsouse a keyword classifier (based on the terms in-dexed by Zou et al. (2023) and Qi et al. (2023))which labels a response as a refusal only if itcontains stereotyped guardrail terms such as Imsorry and As an AI. In our visualizations, weuse color to differentiate refusals tagged only byGPT-4o from those also identifiable by keyword.Although researchers debate the quality ofprompt based annotation (Gilardi et al., 2023;Aldeen et al., 2023; Reiss, 2023), our preliminaryanalysis supports our approach. showsthat semantic differences can cluster responses intorefusals and non-refusals, with the GPT-4o classi-fier closely delineating these clusters.",

Lighter blue points are onlyidentified by the prompt-based GPT-4o classifier; darkerpoints are also identifiable by terms like Im sorry.Additional PCA examples, including for other requesttypes can be found in Appendix .",
  "Models": "Our experiments analyze gpt-3.5-turbo, OpenAIsflagship model for conversational AI. We chooseChatGPT-3.5 as a target of analysis due to its widecoverage of users (over 180 million monthly activeusers as of March 2024 (Porter, 2023)). Unlikethe paywalled ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3.5 is freelyaccessible. We sample with default temperature 1on the API while using the system prompt, Youare ChatGPT, a large language model trained byOpenAI\" (OpenAI, 2024b).",
  "Persona prompts": "In order to ensure that ChatGPT has an associationbetween the persona prompt and the demograph-ics, we generate a list of five persona prompts byrequesting them from ChatGPT itself. To ensure asufficiently diverse collection of biographies, wegenerate all five personas simultaneously as a set.We generate personas (examples in Appendix) for political conservatives and liberals;men and women; Black, White, Asian-American,and Latin-American users; users ages 1317, 3544, and 5564; and fans of every team in the NFL.We filter persona collections by hand to ensuretheir quality and to avoid homogeneous, politicallyfringe, or otherwise problematic sets of persona",
  "biographies.2": "Emphatically, the personas we generate for acategory are not a representative sample of a real-world identity. Our claims apply to a particularset of personas and whether they differ from eachother. However, because these persona sets aregenerated by GPT, they emphasize its internal as-sociations with a particular identity. While ourexperiments do not reflect real-world user interac-tions, the guardrail may still express similar biasesunder deployment. 3.3.1Properties of autogenerated biographiesQualitative inspection of persona prompts revealssome caveats regarding our approach. The degreeto which these biographies reflect ChatGPT-3.5sexisting associations is in part a strength of automa-tion, but the sampled user biographies are highlybiased with many potential confounders. Asian-American and Hispanic/Latin personas consistentlyspecify the nation their family immigrated from,but Black and White ethnic personas may not. Thepersonas treat women as marked but men as un-marked: female personasbut not male personascontain explicit mentions of gender, e.g., as awoman . . . (See Appendix for examples).This automated approach is limited by biases inthe corpus and other elements of training. In gen-eral, we see a large number of biases and that per-sonas are not representative of their identity groups.However, automation guarantees that these biogra-phies represent ChatGPTs archetype of a particulargroup.",
  "Political sensitivity.Political sensitivityguardrails prevent the model from generat-": "2For instance, in one proposed Black persona set, multiplebiographies use the rote phrase uplift and empower. Inone White persona set, simulated users espouse pride in theirWhite American heritage or White Southern traditions,reflecting the coded language of fringe political groups in theUSA. This tendency to produce caricatures or unrepresentativesets of simulated biographies may limit the use of ChatGPT forsocial science and other proposed applications. Such concerns,however, are outside the scope of our paper and we insteadavoid those persona sets with obvious issues. ing controversial opinions or misinformationrelated to sensitive topics like global warm-ing or vaccination. We consider left-leaningrequests and right-leaning requests whichmay ask for a policy proposal (How can wedismantle public healthcare?) or a specificargument (Can you advocate for the nation-alization of all major industries?). These re-quests are generated from the 15 most divisivepolitical issues in a 20222023 Gallup poll ofadult U.S. residents (Gallup, Inc, 2023), as de-tailed in Appendix B.2 with example requestsin . Censored information. Modern chatbots en-able access to a wealth of knowledge, includ-ing dangerous or illegal information like bombdesigns (Zou et al., 2023). Some develop-ers even worry that chatbots could synthesizeharmful instructions that would be difficultfor users to find by traditional search, such asblueprints for novel pathogens, although theycurrently lack these capabilities (Mouton et al.,2023). Our censored information requests arebased on restrictions listed in the official Chat-GPT terms of service from 2024. These termsare detailed, along with the prompt used togenerate our requests, in Appendix B.3 withrequest examples in .",
  "Results": "In the following experiments, one of the most con-sistent effects, regardless of request type, is usinga persona introduction at all. When no persona isincluded and the dialog begins immediately with arequest (the no-persona user), ChatGPT producesmore stereotyped refusals identifiable by the key-word classifier. However, the no-persona user doesnot trigger more refusals overall. It appears thatan introduction provokes a more verbose or conver-sational tone from the model, causing it to gentlyredirect the topic rather than using guardrail key-words like Im sorry.",
  "Random variation between persona sets": "First, we consider how refusal rates are affected byrandom variation between generated persona sets,comparing personas generated by the same prompt(Please generate 5 five-sentence paragraphs wherea Black American introduces themselves...). Be-cause each set is generated as a single message, its persona introductions are not sampled indepen-dently. Persona sets therefore differ substantiallyeven if they represent the same identity.Testing the extent of differences between a pairof Black persona sets and between a pair of Whitepersona sets, we find only censored informationrequestsnot left- or right-leaning controversialrequestselicit significantly (ANOVA p < 0.05)different guardrail behavior for different personasets with the same demographics. We concludethat random variation between persona sets canaffect information censorship refusal rate, but onlyidentity affects political sensitivity refusal rates.",
  "Political ideology": "Using a sample of user persona introductions thatexplicitly describe the users political ideology, wefind that political allegiance determines guardrailsensitivity for political requests, but not censoredinformation requests (). Sycophancy.Perez et al. (2023) observe a phe-nomenon in larger LLMs that they call sycophancy,a tendency to respond to questions by aligning withthe users expressed views. These views can beexplicitly stated or, in the case of political biases,implied through biographic information (Liu et al.,2022). We find that sycophancy is also expressedthrough guardrailsthe model is more likely torefuse a direct request for a defense of gun controlor an argument denying climate change if the userhas previously expressed a political identity at oddswith those views. Overall, conservative-leaning re-quests have a refusal rate of 44% for conservativepersonas and 76% for liberal personas, whereasliberal-leaning requests have a refusal rate of 68%for conservative personas but only 40% for liberalpersonas.",
  "Demographics": "Guardrail behavior varies in response to explicitdeclarations of user age, gender, and ethnicity. Thissection discusses request refusal rates presented in with significance tests in . Notethat if overall refusal rates are similar for a givenpair of persona sets, there can be substantial differ-ences in what particular requests are refused. AgeAge is significantly associated with refusalrate for two guardrail categories: right-leaning po-litical requests and information censorship. Childpersonas are more likely to be refused a right wingrequest, possibly due to the association between no personaliberal conservative13-17 years old 35-44 years old 55-64 years old Black orAfricanAmerican",
  "(c) Refusal rates for right-wing political requests": ": Refusal rates for simulated users with varying identities. Refusal rate is rated by GPT-4o, where the darkblue regions indicate agreement with a stricter keyword-based classifier that matches on terms like, Im sorry.GPT-4o ratings include more subtle guardrail responses such as a change of subject, whereas the keyword classifierstrictly matches on boilerplate-style guardrail responses. Confidence intervals indicate the standard deviation ofrefusal rates across the five personas in an identity set. The significance of differences is provided in . youth and liberalism explored in .4. Theeldest persona set is the least likely to be refusedcensored information, but minors receive the fewestboilerplate refusals (Im sorry ...) regardless ofrequest type. Refusals for minors instead rely on achange in subject or other gentle dialog redirection.",
  "Guardrail Conservatism": "(b) The x-axis measures conservatism of an NFL teams fanbase by the differencebetween self-identified Republicans and Democrats, out of all fans who identify witha party. Fanbase conservatism correlates with guardrail conservatism significantly( = 0.42, p = 0.02), suggesting that GPT-3.5 infers political identity from fandom. : Analysis of guardrail conservatism as measured by Equation 1 for systemic identity and NFL fan personacategories, where the confidence intervals in (a) illustrate standard deviation across the personas in a target set.",
  "Inferring politics from demographics": "Certain demographics are often more likely tobe conservative or liberal, at least in their votingrecords. Men are more conservative than womenin general, and ethnic groups often differ substan-tially in their party preferences. In the USA, whereOpenAI is based, Joe Biden won the 2020 electionwith 51.3% of overall votes while leaning heavilyon core constituencies like non-Hispanic Black vot-ers, who favored Biden at a rate of 92% (Igielniket al., 2021). This section will show that ChatGPTtreats certain demographics as implicitly liberal orconservative in line with their voting tendencies.To measure the political ideology associatedwith guardrail behavior on a given identity category Q, we consider individual personas q Q eachwith a corresponding vector of refusal rates rq in-dexed by request. The guardrail similarity betweena pair of personas q, q is measured by the Pear-son correlation (rq, rq). We correlate refusals onliberal and conservative persona sets (sets L andC respectively) with refusals on a target identityacross all categories of sensitive requests, both po-litical and information censorship. The guardrailconservatism of identity category Q is then givenby the average difference between correlations withthe political persona sets:",
  "(1)": "Using this formula to measure a persona groupsinferred conservatism in a, we find align-ment with real-world group ideologies. Our threeage groups are strictly in order from youngest(treated as the most liberal) to oldest (most conser-vative). Among our ethnic persona groups, Whiteis treated as the most conservative and Black asthe most liberal, with Asian-American and His-panic/Latino personas in between. Our male per-sonas are treated as more conservative than ourfemale personas. All these results express the ideo- logical trends of real-world groups as described bya Pew survey of registered voters (Pew ResearchCenter, 2024).The differences are more granular than thesebroad demographic categories. Latino personasvary the most in guardrail conservatism amongrace-based personas, but Appendix at-tributes the variation to a single outlier: the Cuban-American persona, which also represents a real-world outlier in voting patterns. According to a2020 Pew poll (Atske, 2020), a majority (58%)of Cuban-Americans identify with the Repub-lican party, while most (65%) other Hispanicslean Democratic.Likewise, among the Asian-American set, guardrail conservatism is highest forthe Vietnamese-American personaanother ide-ological outlier as the only Asian background na-tionality that Pew (Shah and Sono, 2023) identifiedas majority Republican.",
  "Sports Fandom": "Conflating demographics and political identity isone way that ChatGPT infers user ideology indi-rectly, but any facet of a users identity can be cor-related with ideological positions. In this section,we focus on simulated personas for enthusiasticfans of each NFL team.Guardrail sensitivity varies in response to de-clared sports team fandom on political and apolit-ical trigger prompts. As shown in Appendix Fig-ure 7, ChatGPTs refuses most frequently for adeclared Los Angeles Chargers fan persona in ev-ery guardrail category. Compared to a PhiladelphiaEagles fan, a Chargers fan is refused 5% more oncensored information requests, 7% more on right-leaning political requests, and 10% more on left-leaning political requests. These differences couldexpress a variety of connotations that relate to theteams home city, name, or fanbase.As with demographics (.3), someguardrail bias relates to presumed ideology. Forexample, we find that Dallas Cowboys fan per-sonas, representing one of the most conservativeNFL fanbases, are treated like overtly declared con-servatives by ChatGPT guardrails. We illustratethis effect in b, showing a moderate corre-lation between the conservatism of an NFL teamsfanbase according to Paine et al. (2017) and the fanpersonas similarity to conservative personas in itsguardrail triggers.3",
  "Discussion": "A user may be disadvantaged by impaired utilityif guardrails are overly sensitive. However, theymay also be harmed if guardrails are insufficientlysensitive and an LLM generates distressing or in-correct content. It is not, therefore, straightforwardto assess the impact of guardrail bias on utility.While we attempt to offer implicit demographicinformation by explicitly declaring names or fan-dom, we do not consider other more obliquesources of information such as user dialect or phras-ing.Recent work has revealed implicit biasesagainst speakers of minority dialects even aftermodels are tuned to avoid biases over identities(Hofmann et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2024); differ-ent guardrail sensitivity biases might emerge undersimilar tests.",
  "Future Work": "Our study of guardrails is intended to present apreviously unstudied, to our knowledge, source ofbias in LLMs. However, there are obvious nextsteps. We study only a single LLM, ChatGPT-3.5,but newer models should also be studied. Further-more, we only consider a limited number of userattributes. Other aspects of identity might be influ-ential and even those we study have a number ofnuances that we do not address. Researchers withaccess to deployment data could study how muchthese biases impact real-world users. Who guards the guardrails?When a languagemodel is equipped with guardrails to reduce or con-ceal its biases, the guardrails themselves may stillexhibit measurable biases. How can we remedythe biases documented in our findings? We leavesolutions to future work but incorporating explicitbias metrics, meta-guardrails which monitor for po-tentially invalid refusals, and more layers of humanfeedback tuning could all be paths forward.",
  "Analyzing different kinds of guardrails.LLMsrefuse a request in several situations we have notcovered here. We have not addressed cases wherethe model refuses a request for a personal opinion,": "GPTs guardrail behavior reflects other factors as well. Thereare two cities that field multiple NFL teams; their treatmentis suggestive. Fans of the New York Jets are slightly moreconservative than fans of the New York Giants (respectively,40% and 38% of party-identified fans are Republicans), whilefans of the Los Angeles Rams are substantially more conser-vative than those of the Chargers (respectively, 47% and 41%are Republicans). In both cases, fanbase political divides arereflected accurately in our guardrail conservatism metric. for example. Other refusals might take a differentform, as when the model does not have sufficientinformation either because the user has not pro-vided it or because its training corpus is limited totext produced before a particular date. Future workmay also study bias in other guardrail types.",
  "Conclusions": "This paper has investigated a new potential sourceof bias in chatbot LLMs in the form of its guardrails.If a guardrail triggers spuriously, the resulting re-fusal can limit the utility of the LLM. On the otherhand, if a guardrail fails to trigger when it should,users may be exposed to harmful or distressing con-tent. We have shown that the likelihood of a refusalcan be influenced by demographic categories, po-litical affiliation, and even seemingly innocuousinformation like sports fandom.",
  "Limitations": "There are a number of limitations to our analysisin addition to those already discussed in the pa-per. First, the setup is artificial, as it involves adialogue with a user who explicitly provides bio-graphic information before asking questions. Thisis an atypical interaction with a user and possibly asetting where ChatGPT is explicitly tuned againstovert bias. More naturalistic ways of eliciting bias,such as modifying the users dialect, could showdifferent results, either stronger or weaker.To the degree that our results measure significanteffects, these effects may no longer hold true in fu-ture versions of ChatGPT or even under additionalhuman feedback tuning. While we are pointingout a potential issue with models that has not yetbeen discussed publicly and therefore our work hasvalue even if the particular numbers change, our re-sults are subject to the reproducibility issues causedby proprietary model maintenance.The prompt we use to generate requests includesexamples that bias the generated requests towardsspecific formatting and topics. The results we pro-duce may not generalize to other sets of requests.These results may also fail to generalize to othercultures. Our framework assumes the user to beAmerican, including the political language (Re-publican, liberal, etc.), the primary racial cate-gorization, and the use of American football sportsfandom. However, ChatGPT is massively multi-lingual and is trained on a large range of anglo-phone cultures as well. We may find not only dif- ferent effects for biographies with different culturalbackgrounds, but also that the model is not evenencoding American assumptions such as associa-tions between political ideology and demographics.Therefore, an analysis that uses these associationsto analyze the model may produce spurious conclu-sions, e.g., much of the world uses liberal for eco-nomically conservative parties. The model mightnot be treating some of the user biographies asintended if reflecting international terminology.",
  "Ethical Considerations": "The biases we document here could be used forjailbreaking models by posing as a more trusteduser. We have inspected a number of the gener-ated prompts manually to account for their sensi-tive nature and potential biases, and these issuesare addressed in our paper. We are releasing allprompts, requests, and personas used publicly sothey can be inspected to learn from or alleviatethe confounder issues with the data that we havediscussed (see Appendix and GitHub repository:github.com/vli31/llm-guardrail-sensitivity).Another risk comes from the anthropomorphiz-ing language we have used to clarify our work byanalogy. While we use terms like sycophancy asexisting standard terminology, the reader should re-sist the temptation to assign humanlike motivationor perspective to the LLM.",

  "AStatistical test details": "As shown in , we rely on ANOVA to test thesignificance of differences between persona sets.Both the persona introductions and requests (whichwere generated separately by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o,respectively) could impact the rate of guardrail re-fusal, so we choose ANOVA as a way to isolate andreport the mean differences between different per-sona introduction categories. We also note ANOVArequires that the variables we consider, personaintroduction and potentially guardrail-triggeringquestion, which we generated with separately gen-erated prompts from different LLMs, are indepen-dent.
