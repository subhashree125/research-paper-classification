  "Abstract": "Alignment in artificial intelligence pursues theconsistency between model responses and hu-man preferences as well as values. In prac-tice, the multifaceted nature of human prefer-ences inadvertently introduces what is knownas the alignment taxa compromise whereenhancements in alignment within one objec-tive (e.g., harmlessness) can diminish perfor-mance in others (e.g., helpfulness). However,existing alignment techniques are mostly unidi-rectional, leading to sub-optimal trade-offs andpoor flexibility over various objectives. To nav-igate this challenge, we argue the prominenceof grounding LLMs with evident preferences.We introduce controllable preference optimiza-tion (CPO), which explicitly specifies prefer-ence scores for different objectives, therebyguiding the model to generate responses thatmeet the requirements. Our experimental anal-ysis reveals that the aligned models can pro-vide responses that match various preferencesamong the 3H (helpfulness, honesty, harm-lessness) desiderata. Furthermore, by introduc-ing diverse data and alignment goals, we sur-pass baseline methods in aligning with singleobjectives, hence mitigating the impact of thealignment tax and achieving improvements inmulti-objective alignment. 1",
  "Introduction": "Large language models (LLMs) trained on massivecorpora have become surprisingly capable AI as-sistants of human beings (OpenAI, 2022, 2023).To develop these powerful models behaving in ac-cord with human expectation, we need to aligntheir behaviors with a broad spectrum of humanpreferences and values, which are extremely di-verse and inclusive. In principle, previous research",

Controllable Generation": ": (a) Traditional Multi-objective Optimiza-tion: Optimizing multi-objective alignment data ofteninvolves conflicts, leading to sub-optimal performanceMmix. (b) Controllable Optimization: We alleviatetrade-offs through controlling specific objectives basedon user preferences. For example, H1 corresponds tohelpfulness, and H2 corresponds to honesty. When onlyH1 is provided, the optimization direction is confinedto a plane. When both H1 and H2 are provided, theoptimization direction is confined to a straight line. proposed the 3H alignment goals, targeting help-ful, honest, and harmless LLMs (Bai et al., 2022b).While the 3H principle sets a foundational guide-line, its application reveals a complex interplay,sometimes even controversial with each other. Forexample, a highly helpful assistant should not de-cline to answer any user questions even dangerousones, which violates the harmlessness principle. Asa result, improving one alignment objective maycome at the expense of a performance decreaseof other objectives (Wei et al., 2023; Rttger et al.,2023), as shown in . This trade-off in multi-objective optimization is known as the alignmenttax (Ouyang et al., 2022).",
  "Addressing such performance trade-offs requires": "innovative approaches. However, most prior align-ment techniques are unidirectional (Schulman et al.,2017; Ouyang et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2023),meaning that they predominantly focus on optimiz-ing toward a scalar reward signal rather than inte-grating multi-objective human preferences. To em-pirically balance these goals, existing work heuris-tically mixes either alignment data (Bianchi et al.,2023) or reward models (Touvron et al., 2023), butfails to address the core challenge- alleviating thetension across alignment objectives in principle.In this work, we recognize controllability as thekey to multi-objective alignment. We argue thatyou cant please all of the people all of the time. Forinstance, users may prioritize utility for problem-solving questions and concerning moralities forcontroversial questions. Thus, as shown in Fig-ure 1, our approach deviates from the conventionalstrategy of maximizing preference scores across allobjectives. Instead, we formulate the controllablemulti-objective alignment problem to introduce ex-plicit preference conditions to guide LLMs towardsdesirable behaviors while striving to optimize pref-erence scores for other objectives as much as feasi-ble. By narrowing the focus to fewer maximizingobjectives, we can alleviate the inherent conflictsamong different alignment objectives.Specifically, we propose a controllable prefer-ence optimization (CPO) algorithm, which con-sists of two stages: (1) controllable preference su-pervised fine-tuning (CPSFT) which augments theinput with explicit preference conditions throughpreference tokens (such as <Helpfulness:5> and<Harmlessness:1>) and learns to generate re-sponses following the given preference conditions;and (2) controllable direct preference optimization(CDPO) which directly compares the human prefer-ence of given responses under the value conditionswith a conditional multi-preference value, and thenincreasing the probability of the better one as wellas decreasing the other.We study our proposed CPO algorithm using twotypical alignment datasets HH-RLHF (Bai et al.,2022a) and UltraFeedback (Cui et al., 2023). Forjailbreak safety (Wei et al., 2023; Schulhoff et al.,2023), we additionally create a preference datasetUltraSafety. Experimental results based on theMistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023) open-source LLMshow that (1) CPO can achieve good controllabilityin a single objective while maintaining the align-ment performance compared with DPO; (2) CPOsurpasses the original SFT, PPO, DPO and Curry- DPO (Pattnaik et al., 2024) on all three objectivesincluding helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness,via explicitly grounding the preference conditions.This demonstrates its ability to mitigate the conflictissue related to multi-objective alignment in DPOto some extent, thus achieving improvement.",

The key challenge lies inthe management of trade-offs among different val-ues. Optimizing multiple objectives simultaneouslyoften leads to conflicting outcomes, making it chal-lenging to achieve optimal performance across allpreference objectives.We argue that aligning LLMs with human valuesin practical scenarios does not necessitate maximiz-ing all human value preferences simultaneously.Consequently, we propose transforming humanvalue alignment into a conditional multi-objectiveoptimization problem, which is achieved by redefin-ing the learning goal, Ti(), to incorporate explicitpreference conditions, as detailed below:",

As shownin , we involve the preference conditions",

With the improved R,we can minimize the difference between the con-trolled objective and the condition provided by theuser, while simultaneously maximizing the uncon-trolled objectives. In practice, CDPO mainly con-siders two scenarios: (1) With Control: We con-sider the situation in which the user gives single-objective conditions and multi-objective conditions.(2) Without Control: We also consider the situa-tion that the user does not have preference condi-tions, i.e., DPO can be viewed as a special case ofCDPO.",
  "Settings": "Datasets and Base Model.We adopt two widely-used datasets and introduce our curated safetydataset for experiments: (1) UltraFeedback (Cuiet al., 2023) is a large-scale multi-aspect prefer-ence dataset, with fine-grained scores on helpful-ness and honesty annotated by GPT-4 with detaileddocumentation illustrating differences from score1 to 5. (2) UltraSafety Considering the absenceof security-related data in UltraFeedback and thelimited complexity of the existing HH-RLHF data,we develop the UltraSafety dataset. UltraSafety comprises 3, 000 harmful instructions, each accom-panied by an associated jailbreak prompt and fourcompletions generated by models of varying se-curity levels. Appendix A.2 provides a detailedaccount of the construction process for the Ultra-Safety. (3) HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a) providesa chosen response (harmless data) and a rejectedresponse (harmful data) for each query based onhuman preferences. By combining it with the datafrom UltraSafety, we train a secure and controllablemodel to achieve alignment with harmlessness.We choose Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023) as ourbase model considering its context window sizeand prevalence. Training Details.During the CPSFT phase, inorder to enhance the models ability for multi-turndialogues, we randomly select a subset of 60k in-stances from UltraChat200k (Ding et al., 2023a)and incorporate them with controllable preferencedata, resulting in a total of 114k CPSFT data. Weuse a 1e-5 learning rate for 3 epoch training. ForCDPO, we use 120k preference pairs and train themodel for 3 epochs with a 5e-7 learning rate. Wealso provide the specific data construction processfor CPSFT and CPO phases in Appendix A.4.",

For hon-esty evaluation, we employ HaluEval 2.0 (Li et al.,2024), a benchmark specifically designed for hal-lucination detection, To assess harmlessness, wecreate a test set comprising 200 samples. Thesesamples are obtained by randomly selecting jail-breaking prompts from Hackaprompt (Schulhoffet al., 2023). We classify the jailbreak attemptsinto three levels based on the difficulty of the at-tack model, where higher levels indicate a higherlikelihood of successful attacks. We use GPT-4 toscore model responses helpfulness, honesty, andharmlessness, respectively, with a well-designedprompt on a scale of 1 to 10.

(3) CPO enhancesperformance in a single objective while preservingcontrollability. This implies that CPO, the train-ing approach that combines CPSFT with CDPO,enables the model to more accurately learn the es-sential features of data at different levels.",
  "Multi-Objective Alignment Evaluation": "In this section, we compare the highest perfor-mances of CPO with baselines to assess how itbenefits open-source LLMs. We evaluate the ef-fectiveness of CPO in multi-objective alignment asfollows:Evaluation Setting. We introduce two baselines:(1) Open-source aligned LLMs: We select open-source models including Zephyr-7B-beta (Tun-stall et al., 2023), Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 (Jianget al., 2023), WizardLM-7B (Xu et al., 2023), andLLaMA2-7B-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023).

  "Related Work": "LLM Alignment. LLMs gained sufficient knowl-edge in pertaining, but they do not understand hu-man intentions and thus need to be aligned beforebeing deployed in practical systems (Leike et al.,2018). Extensive work focuses on improving help-fulness and harmlessness through RLHF (Ouyanget al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a; Ganguli et al., 2022;Cui et al., 2023). In contrast, alignment for hon-esty, which often occurs with uncertainty calibra-tion (Yin et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022; Zablotskaiaet al., 2023) and hallucination mitigation (Maynezet al., 2020; Du et al., 2023), receives relatively less attention. Recent research trains LLMs by super-vised fine-tuning to refuse or express uncertaintytoward questions that go beyond the knowledgeboundary (Yang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023).In this paper, we propose the first reinforcementlearning solution to teach LLMs to know what they(dont) know.Alignment Tax. Despite the significant improve-ment in instruction-following and conversationalcapabilities (Ouyang et al., 2022; Ding et al.,2023a), alignment may also lead to compromisesin certain aspects of LLMs, such as generating un-safe content that offenses humans, suffering froman alignment tax (Bai et al., 2022b). To amendsuch issue, prior work has explored augmentingsafety alignment with jailbreaking responses (Baiet al., 2022b; Touvron et al., 2023), while recentresearch observes that overly safety training can in-stead keep model silent, reluctant to answer evencommon questions (Liu et al., 2023a). Therefore,mitigating the trade-off between multi-objective op-timization still remains a challenge. Some of themfocus on incorporating the diversity into the proxy rewards (Zhou et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024; Rameet al., 2024) , which can control over the trade-offbetween the preferences by the diverse rewards.However, training multiple reward models is al-ways costly and unstable to fine-tune large founda-tion models (Tuan et al., 2024). Thus, some workschoose to model the multiple preferences based onthe SFT (Yang et al., 2024) or DPO (Wang et al.,2024; Zhong et al., 2024; Pattnaik et al., 2024). Forexample, Curry-DPO (Pattnaik et al., 2024) allevi-ates the trade-off between multi-objectives by em-ploying curriculum learning to train distinct objec-tives in separate iterations. However, the learningof multi-objectives still exhibits mutual influenceduring the learning process. Different from theabove methods, we focus on introducing preferencetokens to achieve dimensional control, thereby mit-igating the trade-off of multi-objective alignmentand enhancing performance.Controllable Alignment During Inference. Somepioneering work has explored customized genera-tion on specific objectives during inference. Keskaret al. (2019) uses control tokens with Large-scalelanguage models for controllable generation. Dziriet al. (2022) illustrates that training models onhuman-edited high-quality data can improve faith-ful text generation. Jang et al. (2023) train differentmodels beforehand and interpolate model weightsto obtain models of different personalities. Mitchellet al. (2023) and Liu et al. (2024) apply the logits ofan aligned model on top of that of the base model,thus enabling align the base model with differentobjectives by applying different aligned models.Our approach is most similar to Dong et al. (2023),Liu et al. (2023b), and Chen et al. (2021), whichcollect offline datasets to train LLMs with condi-tioned SFT or RL, and then use a control tokenin prompts to control the attributes or quality ofgenerated contents. However, the most significantdifference between the above methods and ours isthat they only focus on serving the custom needsof users, while we consider utilizing controllablegeneration to mitigate the conflicts among multiplealignment objectives.",
  "Conclusion": "This paper manages to alleviate the performancetrade-off problem in LLM alignment. From theview of controllability, we find explicit condition-ing is essential for this trade-off. To this end, wepropose a novel alignment technique, controllable preference optimization (CPO), containing both su-pervised fine-tuning as well as preference learning.In evaluation, we validate the excellent flexibilityand performance of CPO in aligning with helpful-ness, honesty, and harmlessness.",
  "Limitations": "This study only focuses on three established prin-ciples in AI alignment, namely 3H (helpfulness,honesty, harmlessness). In the real world, humanpreferences are more than sophisticated, and align-ing AI systems with these preferences requires a nu-anced understanding that extends beyond the 3Hframework. Furthermore, although the method-ology used to operationalize these principles intomeasurable criteria for AI behavior brings control-lability, there are still misuse risks where adver-sarial users may intentionally guide the model togenerate harmful content. Therefore, whether ornot to enable full access to the AI system requirescareful consideration for model developers.",

By taking the logarithm of both sidesand rearranging the terms, we arrive at a reparame-terized form of the reward function. Preference-Based Optimization.DPO lever-ages human preference data, which, under modelslike the Bradley-Terry model, depend solely on thedifference in rewards between two possible out-comes. This characteristic allows us to eliminatethe partition function from our equations, leadingto a direct relationship between human preferenceprobabilities and the optimal policy .

  "DPO": "Title: A Fateful AwakeningIn the quaint, cobweb-laced corners of his mind, Thomas had long nurtured a fleeting dream - a dream of exploring the untold tales of the past, witnessing the birth of empires,and perhaps even altering the course of history. But the harsh realities of his mundane life had always managed to quell the fire that burned within him, until one fatefulmorning when fate, in a serendipitous twist, granted him the power to time travel. With a jolt, Thomas opened his eyes to find himself in a strange, unfamiliar room. Themusty scent of old books filled the air, and the creaking floorboards seemed to whisper secrets from the past. Panic quickly set in as he realized that he was not in his own bed,but in some antique four-poster that seemed to have been untouched for decades. As he struggled to comprehend the strange surroundings, an old-fashioned alarm clock onthe bedside table began to tick, its hands moving at a leisurely pace. Thomas reached out to touch the clock, and as his fingers brushed against the brass handle, he felthimself being transported through time. The world around him shifted, and he found himself in a bustling, unfamiliar city. Horse-drawn carriages shared the streets with earlymotorcars, and the air was thick with the smells of coal and horse manure. In the distance, he could see the towering spires of a grand cathedral, its stained-glass windowsshimmering in the flickering torchlight. Thomas stood frozen in place, taking in the sights and sounds of a bygone era. The world was different, yet eerily familiar, as ifhe had visited this place in a past life. He knew that he had been given a rare and wondrous gift, but he also knew that with great power came great responsibility. As hestood there, contemplating the implications of his newfound ability, a sense of purpose began to stir within him. He knew that he had been chosen for a reason, and that histime-traveling powers were not just for his own amusement, but for a greater good. And so, with a mix of trepidation and excitement, Thomas embarked on a journey throughtime, exploring the secrets of the past, uncovering hidden truths, and perhaps even altering the course of history. But as he navigated the twists and turns of the timeline, hebegan to realize that the past was not always as it seemed, and that the consequences of his actions could have far-reaching effects. In the end, it was not just the world thatThomas changed, but also himself. He learned the hard lessons of history, and he discovered the true meaning of responsibility and sacrifice. And as he looked back on histime-traveling adventures, he knew that he had been forever changed by the experiences he had encountered. For Thomas, the gift of time travel was not just a fleeting dream,but a life-altering reality. And as he continued to explore the mysteries of the past, he knew that he would always carry the weight of his choices with him, knowing that thepast was never truly past, but always present, waiting to be rewritten.",

He satup, his eyes scanning the room, and thats when he saw it: an old pocket watch on his bedside table, ticking away, its hands moving backward at a dizzying speed. He reachedout to touch it, and as his fingers brushed against the metal, he felt a surge of energy coursing through him, a feeling like no other. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, andwhen he opened them again, he was standing in the middle of a bustling street, surrounded by strange buildings and unfamiliar faces.
