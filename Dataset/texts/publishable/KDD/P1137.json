  "ABSTRACT": "Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), which consist of vari-ous types of nodes and edges, have recently witnessed excellent per-formance in graph mining. However, most existing heterogeneousgraph neural networks (HGNNs) fail to simultaneously handle theproblems of missing attributes, inaccurate attributes and scarcenode labels, which limits their expressiveness. In this paper, wepropose a generative self-supervised model GraMI to address theseissues simultaneously. Specifically, GraMI first initializes all thenodes in the graph with a low-dimensional representation matrix.After that, based on the variational graph autoencoder framework,GraMI learns both node-level and attribute-level embeddings in theencoder, which can provide fine-grained semantic information toconstruct node attributes. In the decoder, GraMI reconstructs bothlinks and attributes. Instead of directly reconstructing raw featuresfor attributed nodes, GraMI generates the initial low-dimensionalrepresentation matrix for all the nodes, based on which raw featuresof attributed nodes are further reconstructed. In this way, GraMI cannot only complete informative features for non-attributed nodes,but rectify inaccurate ones for attributed nodes. Finally, we conductextensive experiments to show the superiority of GraMI in tacklingHINs with missing and inaccurate attributes. Our code and data canbe found here:",

  "INTRODUCTION": "Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) are a type of informa-tion networks that incorporate various types of nodes and edges. Inreal-world scenarios, HINs can effectively model data complexity,which provide rich semantics and a comprehensive view of data.Recently, Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) havereceived great attention and widely used in many related fields,such as social networks , recommender systems , andknowledge graphs . To perform an in-depth analysis on HINs,many HGNN models have been proposed to learn nodesrepresentations and perform well on downstream tasks like nodeclassifcation and link prediction .Dilemmas. At present, although heterogeneous graphs havereceived wide attention , there are two majorchallenges that are easily overlooked in most methods:First, node attributes are generally incomplete in raw datasets.Collecting the attributes of all nodes is difficult due to the high costand privacy concerns . Take the benchmark ACM dataset as an example: the heterogeneous graph modeled by ACM consistsof three types of nodes: Paper, Author and Subject. The attributesof a paper node are derived from the keywords in its title, whilethe other two types of nodes lack attributes. Recent research hasshown that the features of authors and subjects play a crucial rolein learning the embeddings of heterogeneous graphs . Hence,the completion of missing attributes is a matter of concern.Second, inaccurate node attributes can lead to the spread of mis-information, which adversely affects the model performance. Indatasets such as ACM, attributes of Paper nodes are typically ex-tracted from bag-of-words representation of their keywords. How-ever, there might exist some noise. For example, some words that do",
  "Conference17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USAYige Zhao et al": "not help express the topic may be included, or certain words mightbe mislabeled. According to the message passing mechanism ofGNNs , the representation of a node is obtained by aggregatinginformation from its neighbors. If raw node attributes are inaccu-rate, the noise will propagate to the nodes neighbors and degradethe models performance. Therefore, it is important to alleviate theeffect of inaccurate attributes in the graph.Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL), which attempts to ex-tract information from the data itself, becomes a promising solutionwhen no or few labels are provided . In particular, generativeSSL that aims to reconstruct the input graph has beenless studied in HINs. Meanwhile, existing models can only address either problem mentioned above. Due to the preva-lence of attribute incompleteness, attribute inaccuracy and labelscarcity in HINs, there arises a question: Can we develop an unsu-pervised generative model to jointly tackle the problem of missingand inaccurate attributes in HINs?To address the problem, in this paper, we propose a variationalGraph autoencoder for heterogeneous information networks withMissing and Inaccurate attributes, namely, GraMI. As a generativemodel, GraMI is unsupervised and does not rely on node labels inmodel training. To deal with the problem of missing and inaccurateattributes, GraMI first maps all the nodes in HINs, including bothattributed and non-attributed ones, into the same low-dimensionalspace and generates a node representation matrix, where eachrow in the matrix corresponds to a node. The low-dimensionalrepresentations can not only retain useful information and reducenoise in raw features of attributed nodes, but also construct initialfeatures for non-attributed ones. After that, GraMI learns bothnode and attribute embeddings by encoders and reconstructs bothlinks and attributes by decoders. In particular, we learn embeddingsof attributes in the low-dimensional space but not raw features.On the one hand, by collaboratively generating node-level andattribute-level embeddings, fine-grained semantic information canbe obtained for generating attributes. On the other hand, unlikemost existing methods that directly reconstruct raw high-dimensional node features, GraMI instead reconstructs the low-dimensional node representation matrix. This approach not onlyalleviates the adverse effect of noise contained in raw node features,but also enhances the feature information for non-attribute nodes.Further, for attributed nodes, we generate their raw features toleverage the information of accurate attributes. In this way, we cannot only construct informative features for non-attributed nodes,but rectify inaccurate ones for attributed nodes. Finally, our maincontributions are summarized as follows: We propose a self-supervised heterogeneous graph auto-encoder GraMI. To our knowledge, GraMI is the first self-supervised model that tackles the problems of attribute in-completeness and attribute inaccuracy in HINs. We present a novel feature reconstruction method for bothattributed and non-attributed nodes, which can generateinformative attributes for non-attributed nodes and rectifyinaccurate attributes for attributed nodes.",
  "RELATED WORK2.1Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks": "HGNNs have recently attracted wide attention and existing modelscan be divided into two categories based on whether they employmeta-paths . Some models use meta-paths tocapture high-order semantics in the graph. For example, HAN introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism, including node-levelattention and semantic-level attention, to learn node embeddings.Both MAGNN and ConCH further consider intermediatenodes in instances of meta-paths to obtain more semantic informa-tion. There also exist some models that do not requiremeta-paths. A representative model is HGT , a heterogeneousgraph transformer, distinguishes the types of a nodes neighborsand aggregates information from the neighbors according to nodetypes. Further, GTN learns a soft selection of edge types andcomposite relations for generating useful multi-hop connections.",
  "Graph Learning with Missing/InaccurateAttributes": "Due to privacy protection, missing attributes are ubiquitous ingraph-structured data. Some recent methods have been proposedto solve the issue in homogeneous graphs, including GRAPE ,GCNMF and Feature Propagation . There are also meth-ods that are designed for HINs. For example, HGNN-AC proposes the first framework to complete attributes for heteroge-neous graphs, which is based on the attention mechanism and onlyworks in semi-supervised settings. HGCA is an unsupervisedlearning method that attempts to tackle the missing attribute prob-lem by contrastive learning. Further, graph-structured data in thereal world is often corrupted with noise, which leads to inaccurateattributes. Many methods have been proposed toenhance the models robustness against noise by introducing graphaugmentation, adversarial learning, and some other techniques onhomogeneous graph. Due to HINs complex structure, the impactof noise might be even more significant.",
  "Self-supervised Learning on Graphs": "Self-supervised learning on graphs can generally be divided intocontrastive learning and generative approaches . Specifi-cally, contrastive learning uses pre-designed data augmentation toobtain correlated views of a given graph and adopts a contrastiveloss to learn representations that maximize the agreement betweenpositive views while minimizing the disagreement between nega-tive ones . Recently, HeCo uses network schemaand meta-paths as two views in HINs to align both local and globalinformation of nodes. However, the success of contrastive learningheavily relies on informative data augmentation, which has beenshown to be variant across datasets .Generative learning aims to use the input graph for self-supervisionand to recover the input data . In prior research, existing meth-ods include those reconstructing only links , only features ,or a combination of both links and features . A re-cent model SeeGera proposes a hierarchical variational graphauto-encoder and achieves superior results on many downstreamtasks. However, SeeGera is specially designed for homogeneous",

LetT = {1, ,|T|} and R = {1, ,|R|} denote the node typeset and edge type set, respectively. Each node V is associatedwith a node type by a mapping function : V T, and eachedge E has an edge type with a mapping function : E R.When |T | = 1 and |R| = 1, G reduces to a homogeneous graph.[AHINs with missing attributes]. Nodes in AHINs are usuallyassociated with attributes. Given a node type, we denote its corre-sponding attribute set as A A. In the real world, it is prevalentthat some node types in AHINs are given specific attributes whileothers attributes are missing. In this paper, we divide T into twosubsets: T = T + T , where T + represents attributed node typesand T indicates non-attributed ones.[Variational Lower bound]. Given an HIN with the adjacencymatrix A and the attribute matrix X as observations, our goal is tolearn both node embeddings ZV and attribute embeddings ZA. Toapproximate the true posterior distribution (ZV, ZA|A, X), fol-lowing , we adopt semi-implicit variational inference that cancapture a wide range of distributions more than Gaussian anddefine a hierarchical variational distribution (ZV, ZA) with pa-rameter to minimize KL( (ZV, ZA)||(ZV, ZA|A, X)), whichis equivalent to maximizing the ELBO :",

  ": The overall framework of GraMI": "space. There are two reasons that account for this. On the onehand, given numerous features (e.g., text tokens), feature encod-ing could lead to expensive time and memory complexity.

To generate at-tribute embeddings ZA for nodes of type , similar as in thenode-level encoder, we assume 2(ZA | XT ) = =1 2(A| XT ),",
  "Generative model": "The generative model is used to reconstruct both edges E and nodeattributes in a heterogeneous graph.Edge reconstruction. Since there exist multiple types of edgesin an HIN, we distinguish these edges based on two end nodes.

Specifically, given nodes intype and in type , we have = (A = 1|V ,V ) = ((V )TV ), where is the sigmoid function.Attribute reconstruction. Since nodes could have missing orinaccurate features, directly reconstructing raw node attributescould bring noise. To address the issue, we propose to generatethe hidden embedding matrix X instead, which introduces three major benefits. First, X has smaller dimensionality than the originalfeature matrix X; hence, reconstructing X needs less computationalcost. Second, X contains rich semantic information that can covermissing attributes. Third, when raw features are inaccurate, X con-tains less noise than X, and reconstructing X can further removenoise due to the well-known denoising effects of auto-encoders.Given a node type , let X be its corresponding reconstructedhidden representation matrix.

For nodesassociated with features, despite the noise, they could also providerich useful information. Therefore, we further reconstruct the rawfeature matrices. Assume that nodes in type have raw features.Then we generate the raw feature matrix by a MLP model:",
  "L = L + 1L + 2L.(10)": "Here, we introduce two hyperparameters 1 and 2 to control theimportance of different terms.[Time Complexity analysis] The major time complexity in theencoder comes from HGNN and MLP for nodes and attributes, re-spectively. We use the simple HGNN introduced in Sec. 4.2. Supposefor each type of nodes, they have an average number of relatedadjacency matrices {A }=1. Since adjacency matrix is generallysparse, for each A, let A , A and A be the average numberof rows, columns and non-zero entries in each row, respectively.Note that we use the hidden embedding matrix X as input whosedimensionality is . For simplicity, we denote the embeddingdimensionality as in hidden layers of both HGNN and MLP. Fur-ther, let and be the dimensionalities of injected noise to HGNNand MLP, respectively. Then, the time complexities for HGCN andMLP are ((A A ( + ) + A ( + ))) and ( ( + )),respectively. Both time complexities are linear to the number ofnodes in the HIN. In the decoder, to reconstruct attributes, inaddition to HGNN and MLP, we have an additional inner productoperation with time complexity of ( ), which ensures an over-all linear time complexity w.r.t. . For link reconstruction, the timecomplexity is (A A ). As suggested by , we can down-sample the number of nonexistent edges in the graph to reduce thetime complexity for recovering links.[Space Complexity Analysis] For space complexity, we assumeall HGNNs and MLPs are one-layer. We define the total numberof nodes as , the initial attribute dimension as , the initial low-dimensional dimension as , and the encoded dimension as . Forthe inference model, the space complexity for HGNN and MLPare ( ) and ( ). For the generative model, the spacecomplexity for HGNN and MLP are( ) and( ). Therefore,the total time complexity of the model is( ++ + ),which is also linear to the number of nodes.",
  "Discussion": "We next summarize the main difference between GraMI and theSOTA generative model HGMAE for HINs. Although both modelsadopt an encoder-decoder framework, they differ in three mainaspects. First, HGMAE cannot deal with the problem of missingattributes in HINs. When node attributes are missing, HGMAEestimates and fills in the attribute values in the pre-processingstep. When the estimated values are inaccurate, the model perfor-mance could degenerate. However, GraMI takes node attributesas learnable parameters and generates low-dimensional attributes with the decoder. The learning process ensures the high qualityof reconstructed node attributes. Second, when node attributesare inaccurate, the masking mechanism adopted by HGMAE canenhance the models robustness against noise to some degree. How-ever, our model GraMI essentially solves the problem by rectifyingincorrect features and reconstructing more accurate ones. Thisfurther boosts the generalizability of our model. Third, HGMAEfocuses on learning embeddings of nodes in target types only. Thisnarrows the models application on downstream tasks centeringaround nodes in target types. In comparison, GraMI collectivelylearns embeddings for all the nodes in the graph, which broadensthe applicability of our model.",
  "EXPERIMENTS5.1Experimental Settings": "5.1.1Datasets and Baselines. We conduct experiments on fourreal-world HIN datasets: ACM , DBLP , YELP andAMiner . In these datasets, only paper nodes in ACM and DBLP,and business nodes in YELP have raw attributes. For AMiner, thereare not attributes for all types of nodes.In the classification task, we compare GraMI with 10 other semi-supervised/unsupervised baselines, including methods for homoge-neous graphs: GAT , DGI , SeeGera ; methods for HINs:HAN , MAGNN , MAGNN-AC , Mp2vec , DMGI ,HGCA and HGMAE . In particular, MAGNN-AC and HGCAare SOTA methods for attribute completion in HINs; SeeGera andHGMAE are SOTA generative SSL models on graphs in node classi-fication. In the link prediction task, we compare GraMI with fourmethods for homogeneous graphs, i.e., VGAE , SIG-VAE ,CAN , SeeGera , and three methods for HINs that can en-code all types of nodes: RGCN , HGT , MHGCN [? ].",
  "Classification Results": "We first evaluate the performance of GraMI on the node classifica-tion task, where we use Macro-F1 and Micro-F1 as metrics. For bothof them, the larger the value, the better the model performance. Forsemi-supervised methods, labeled nodes are divided into training,validation, and test sets in the ratio of 10%, 10%, and 80%, respec-tively. To ensure a fair comparison between semi-supervised andunsupervised models, following , we only report the classi-fication results on the test set. For baselines that cannot handlemissing attributes, we complete missing attributes by averagingattributes from a nodes neighbors. For datasets ACM, DBLP andYELP, we use learned node embeddings to further train a linearSVM classifier with different training ratios from 10% to 80%.For the largest dataset AMiner, following , we select 20, 40 and60 labeled nodes per class as training set, respectively and furthertrain a Logistic Regression model. We report the average Macro-F1and Micro-F1 results over 10 runs to evaluate the model. 5.2.1With missing attributes. We first show the classification re-sults in the presence of missing features. Since the results of mostbaselines on these benchmark datasets are public, we directly re-port these results from their original papers. For cases where theresults are missing, we obtain them from . The results areshown in and . From the tables, we observe that (1)",

(2) While HGCA can perform well in some cases, it fails torun on the AMiner dataset because it explicitly requires the exis-tence of some attributed nodes in the graph. For the non-attributeddataset, it cannot be applied. Further, HGCA generates features inthe raw high-dimensional space for non-attributed nodes, whileGraMI constructs low-dimensional attributes for them. The formeris more likely to contain noise, which adversely affects the modelperformance. (3) GraMI achieves the best results in 30 out of 36cases, where 60% results are statistically significant. This also showsthe effectiveness of our method. 5.2.2With inaccurate attributes. To verify the robustness of themodel when tackling inaccurate attributes, following , we cor-rupt raw node features with random Gaussian noise N (0, ), where is computed by the standard deviation of the bag-of-words repre-sentations of all the nodes in each graph. In particular, we compareGraMI with HGMAE and HGCA because they are allself-supervised models that are specially designed for HINs. Wevary the noise level and the results are given in . Note thatsince all the nodes in AMiner are non-attributed, we cannot corruptnode attributes and thus exclude the dataset. From the table, weobserve that: (1) With the increase of the noise level, the perfor-mance of all the three methods drops, but GraMI is more robust against HGMAE and HGCA. GraMI constructs low-dimensionalfeatures for non-attributed nodes and it can rectify inaccurate at-tributes for attributed nodes with feature reconstruction. (2) Asthe noise increases, the advantages of GraMI over others aremore statistically significant (see results on ACM and YELP).This further demonstrates that GraMI can well deal with inaccurateattributes in HINs.",
  "Quality of Generated Attributes": "To evaluate the quality of generated attributes by GraMI, we takethe raw graph with generated/reconstructed attributes for both non-attributed and attributed nodes as input, which is further fed intothe MAGNN model for node classification. We call the methodMAGNN-GraMI. We compare it with three variants that have differ-ent attribute completion strategies: MAGNN-AVG, MAGNN-onehot",
  "%90.0693.6593.9394.93**": "and MAGNN-AC . For a non-attributed node, they complete themissing attributes by averaging its neighboring attributes, definingone-hot encoded vectors, and calculating the weighted average ofneighboring attributes with the attention mechanism, respectively.For MAGNN-GraMI, we generate low-dimensional attributes fornon-attributed nodes and replace raw attributes with the recon-structed high-dimensional ones for attributed nodes. The results aregiven in . Due to the space limitation, we choose ACM as therepresentative dataset and the full results are given in Appendix E.4.We find that MAGNN-GraMI achieves the best performance that arealso statistically significant. On the on hand, GraMI can effectivelyutilize fine-grained semantic information from both node-level andattribute-level embeddings to generate high-quality attributes. Onthe other hand, GraMI can denoise the original high-dimensional in-accurate attributes. This ensures the effectiveness of the generatedattributes by GraMI.",
  "Link Prediction": "We further evaluate the performance of GraMI on the link predic-tion task, where we treat the connected nodes in the HIN as positivenode pairs and other unconnected nodes as negative node pairs. Foreach edge type, we divide the positive node pairs into 85% trainingset, 5% validation set and 10% testing set. We also randomly addthe same number of negative node pairs to the dataset. We useAUC (Area Under the Curve) and AP (Average Precision) as theevaluation metrics. We fine-tune hyper-parameters with a patienceof 100 by validation set. For all methods, we run experiments 5times to report the mean and standard deviation values, as shownin . From the table, we observe that: (1) GraMI outperformsbaselines across various relationships in the majority of cases. (2)While SeeGera and SIG-VAE perform well on the P-A relation ofACM dataset, they are designed for homogeneous graphs that disre-gard edge types and cannot provide robust performance. All theseresults show the superiority of GraMI on heterogeneous graphs.",
  "Efficiency Study": "We next evaluate the efficiency of GraMI. To ensure a fair compari-son, we measure the training time of both GraMI and HGCA ,because they rank as the top two best performers. Its noteworthythat both models are self-supervised, which are specially designedfor HINs with missing attributes. Further, since HGCA cannot beapplied on the largest AMiner dataset, we take the second largestdataset DBLP as an example. For illustration, we utilize 80% of labeled nodes as our training set. From the figure 2, we see thatGraMI converges fast and demonstrates consistent performancegrowth. On DBLP, GraMI achieves almost 4 speedup than HGCA.This further shows that GraMI is not only effective but efficient.",
  "Ablation Study": "We next conduct an ablation study to comprehend three main com-ponents of GraMI. To show the importance of edge reconstruction,we remove the term L in Equation 10 and call the variantGraMI_ne (no edge reconstruction). Similarly, to understand theimportance of attribute reconstruction, we remove the term Land L respectively. We call the two variants GraMI_nh (nohidden embedding reconstruction) and GraMI_no (no originalattribute reconstruction). Finally, we compare GraMI with themon three benchmark datasets with different training ratios andshow the results in . We can see that (1) GraMI consis-tently outperforms all variants across the three datasets. (2) Theperformance gap between GraMI and GraMI_ne (GraMI_no) showsthe importance of edge reconstruction (raw attributes reconstruc-tion) in learning node embeddings. (3) GraMI performs better thanGraMI_nh, which shows that the hidden embedding reconstructioncan help generate better embeddings for both non-attributed nodesand attributed nodes, and further boost the model performance.",
  "CONCLUSION": "In this paper, we studied generative SSL on heterogeneous graphand proposed GraMI. Specifically, GraMI employs hierarchical vari-ational inference to generate both node- and attribute-level embed-dings. Importantly, GraMI expands attribute inference in the low-dimensional hidden space to address the problems of missing andinaccurate attributes in HINs. By jointly generating node-level andattribute-level embeddings, fine-grained semantic information canbe obtained for generating attributes. Besides, GraMI reconstructsthe low-dimensional node embedding to alleviate the adverse effectof noise attribute and enhance the feature information of missingattribute. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the per-formance of GraMI. The results shows that GraMI is very effectiveto deal with above problems and leads to superior performance.",
