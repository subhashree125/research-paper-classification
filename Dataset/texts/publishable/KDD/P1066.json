  "INTRODUCTION": "In recent years, the advent of blockchain technology and Web3 hasgiven rise to a novel class of digital assets, known as non-fungibletokens (NFTs). Unlike cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin andETH, NFTs are media files (e.g., visual content and text descriptionsas shown in (a)), attached to a specific digital token thatcan be tracked and verified on a blockchain, which endows theNFTs the property of investment as digital collection. According toForbes1 statistics, as of February 2024, the global NFT market caphas reached nearly 18.29 billion dollars. It signifies a remarkablegrowth rate of about 2,636% compared to the figures in February",

(b) Multi-behaviour transactions:mint, sale, transfer, and burn. 2021. The fastly developing market brings a lot of profit opportu-nities, which attracts many investors into the wave of investment.Therefore, estimating NFT price, offering valuable insights to guidethe investment process, draws lots of effort. Existing studies forestimating NFT price can be roughly divided into two directions,i.e., NFT asset valuation and NFT price prediction, based on differ-ent ideas to get benefits. NFT asset valuation refers to discoveringthe real potential value of NFT, aiming to look for underestimatedhigh-value NFT. Existing approaches mine various factors that caninfluence the worth of NFTs. For example, Mekacher et al. show that tokens with rare or distinctive properties can create asense of scarcity, often resulting in higher prices. Costa et al. predict the NTF price based on its visual content. However, theseworks fail to consider the dynamic nature of NFT market, makingit difficult to suit the market changing with each passing day. As aresult, To better adapt to the highly dynamic market environment,more researchers are focusing on NFT price prediction .It aims to forecast the daily prices of NFTs and pay attention to therise and fall of prices over time, studies in this direction typicallyadopt a sequential model to extract useful information from thehistorical sequence of prices. For example, Jain et al. leveragerecurrent neural networks (RNNs) to forecast the daily price ofa collection based on past prices. Luo et al. incorporate twit-ter activities as supplementary features to predict future prices ofsingle collections.Despite growing interest in NFTs, existing studies for price pre-diction are still limited to the following aspects. On the one hand,existing works are characterized by ambiguous and incompleteproblem definitions and evaluation methods, making it difficult tofairly compare approaches and effectively advance the field. Weorganize the recent studies in , which highlights their dis-crepancies in multiple aspects ranging from problem definition toevaluation. We observe that these works on price prediction onlyfocus on future collection-level prices, while the price variationsamong tokens within identical collections pose an intriguing chal-lenge that needs further exploration. On the other hand, currentresearch on NFT price prediction has failed to leverage valuable information from publicly accessible user behaviors, which offersinsights into uncovering potential price trends. As shown in Fig-ure 1 (b), web3 users engage with NFTs through their digital wallets,participating in multi-behavior transactions such as mints (primarytrade), sales (secondary trade), transfers (zero-price exchange), andeven burns (token destruction). These wallet behaviors containdiverse semantics on market sentiments, which have an importantimpact on shaping market dynamics and NFT prices. Furthermore,identifying potential price trend correlations among NFTs and be-tween NFTs and wallets also is a significant task. This allows usto gain deeper insights into social influences and temporal correla-tions, contributing to enhancing prediction accuracy. For instance,if a wallet with a history of successful NFT investments suddenlystarts divesting from a particular collection, it might signal a shiftin market sentiment that can reflect price trends.To tackle these problems, we provide a hierarchical definition ofthe NFT price prediction problem that is more practical to provideclarity. Concretely, we formulate the NFT price prediction with fore-casting awareness at both the collection and token levels, whichenables our framework to cater to the diverse needs of practicalinvestors in such a highly dynamic market. To understand the ef-fect of users multi-behaviour transactions on the variation of NFTprice, we propose a general wallet profiling framework that aimsto incorporate the influence of wallets when making predictions.Considering the complexity (e.g., multi-behaviour patterns) andsparsity of transactions (e.g., a limited number of wallets partici-pating in trades actively), we develop a COmunity enhanced Muti-bEhavior Transaction graph network model under this framework,named COMET. Specifically, we develop a temporal transactiongraph construction method, in which wallets and NFT collectionsare modeled as nodes and the multi-behaviour transactions are en-coded as heterogeneous edges in the constructed graph. It facilitatesa comprehensive grasp of the interactions between collections andwallets, simultaneously capturing underlying correlations amongdifferent collections. Furthermore, we design a temporal transactiongraph learning model to learn the representations of collections andwallets, which can adaptively propagate the influence of wallets onthe constructed graph. To further relieve the sparsity problem, weintroduce communities to enrich the similarity among the nodesthat exist in the same community. Finally, we optimize the proposedmodel hierarchically for the collection and token level due to thediscrepancy, which cannot be ignored, between these two tasks.In summary, our contributions are as follows: We systematically formalize a comprehensive and practicalproblem definition for NFT price prediction, incorporatingboth collection-level and token-level analyses, to address theuniversal requirements of investors. We propose a novel wallet profiling framework for NFT priceprediction, mining the social influence behind transactions.Specifically, we develop a graph modeling method, designa community enhanced multi-behaviour transaction graphmodel, and hierarchically predict two-level targets. We build an NFT price prediction system and deploy it inpractice, which encompasses data infrastructure and productapplications. We conduct extensive experiments to validatethe effectiveness of COMET and its components.",
  "RELATED WORK": "We survey the related studies on NFT valuation and price prediction,graph learning for finance, and temporal graph learning.NFT Valuation and Price Prediction. As an emerging digitalasset class, NFTs have attracted exploratory efforts that considervarious influencing factors aimed at estimating their prices. Wecategorize them into asset valuation and price prediction, summa-rized in . From this table, we can observe that the asset valueapproaches are all for token-level NFT pricing, while the price pre-diction methods are for daily-level collection price prediction. Theformer usually estimates the current or intrinsic value of a specificNFT based on multiple relatively static factors, such as rarity ,multimodal content , and twitter activities . However, theseworks lack forecasting awareness and cannot meet the require-ments of investors in such a dynamic market. Existing studies onNFT price prediction mainly focus on daily collection price pre-diction. For example, Brunet et al. collected tweets based onkeyword search and analyzed the latent correlation between thenumber of tweets and the average collection price. Luo et al. conducted sentiment analysis based on tweet texts and predictedthe next-day movement of the collection-level price with multipleregression models. However, due to the lack of standardized prob-lem definitions, datasets and evaluations, these approaches are hardto be fairly compared with each other. Moreover, they can onlyprovide vague signals on which collection should be invested, whileignoring the discrepancy between a specific token and collections,e.g., the price trend of an NFT may be contrary to that of the wholecollection. In addition, the influence of wallets multi-behaviours onthe collection price is not included when modeling the predictivepatterns. These shortcomings prevent the existing approaches fromachieving the optima. Different from previous works, we present apractical problem definition of NFT price prediction and a walletprofiling framework to analyze the social influence on NFT prices.Graph Learning for Finance. Graph structure plays an impor-tant role in presenting financial knowledge, which facilitates un-derstanding the correlations among financial assets . A notableapplication of this can be found in stock price prediction. Works constructed stock relationship graphs based on historicalsequence correlations or stock description documents. Furthermore,studies explored the relationship between stocks and fundmanagers by constructing a heterogeneous graph. Utilizing the constructed graphs, most of these studies employ graph neuralnetworks (GNNs) to extract meaningful features for their financialtasks . Despite the prevalence of graph structures in stock mar-kets, the construction and modeling methods for graphs remainunexplored in NFT price prediction. Incorporating multi-behaviortransactions into graphs is a challenge that needs to be addressed.Temporal Graph Learning. As graph learning has demon-strated impressive performance on static graphs ,researchers have started to explore more challenging graphs withtemporal evolution. The paradigms of existing methods can bebroadly grouped into timestamp embedding, parameter sequentialembedding, and hidden state sequential embedding . Times-tamp embedding-base methods treat timestamps as a featuretype, incorporating them alongside other features during the prop-agation process of GNNs. Methods based on parameter sequentialembedding use RNNs to dynamically encode the parametersof GNNs across time steps. Approaches based on hidden state se-quential embedding encode each snapshot of data with GNNs,then employ RNNs to capture the temporal relationships betweenthese snapshots. Although these methods are adept at capturingtemporal information, they struggle with addressing challengesposed by sparse and multi-behaviour transactions in NFT domains.",
  "PROBLEM DEFINITION": "Notations. Within in NFT ecosystem, let us denote a set of NFTcollections as C. For each collection C, we denote a set of itstokens as U. There is also a set of wallets, and we denote it asW.

Thisapproach not only allows us to analyze the overall price trendsof collections, but also understand the relative price relationshipsbetween individual tokens and their collections.Collection-Level price trend prediction.

  "We collect NFT-related data from multiple resources and performseveral key pre-processing to obtain insightful data": "4.1.1Data Collection. NFT-related data can be categorized intoon-chain and off-chain data. Generally, on-chain data include trans-action history, token ownership, etc., which are directly recordedon the blockchain. In contrast, off-chain data refer to informationthat exists outside the blockchain, mainly including NFT metadata,NFT files, etc. We present two distinct data collection solutions thatare tailored for both industrial and lighting applications.Infrasturture-supported Solution. We establish a local Ethereumnode using Geth2, enabling us to extract transaction data directlyfrom the blockchain using the Ethereum ETL3 library. For off-chaindata, we harness the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)4 to crawlthem. This industrial-scale solution prioritizes scalability, efficiency,and data integrity. It ensures efficient access to both on-chain andoff-chain NFT data, while enabling real-time and unlimited dataextraction and handling.Public API-based Solution.

This highly flexible solution provides users and communitieswith accessible tools for investigating studies related to NFT": "4.1.2Data Preprocessing. To improve the quality and usability ofNFT-related data, we perform a series of key data preprocessing.Sale Noise Removal. As is common in financial markets, the NFTmarketplace often experiences the presence of noisy transactions.To mitigate this, we first employ the robust strongly connectedgraph method to identify and isolate wash sales, similar to work. Then, we apply the Box-Whisker method on sale time seriesto exclude sales with anomalously high or low prices.Collection-level Price Aggregation. In this study, we opt for thedaily median price as the preferred collection-level price metric.This choice serves to mitigate the potential impact of anomaloussale prices on the aggregation process, resulting in a more robustmodeling of collection-level pricing trends. In cases where there areno recorded sales on certain days, we employ linear interpolationto address the data gap.Multimodal Content Embedding. NFT consists mainly of visualand textual content. We employ a pretrained vision transformer(ViT) model to embed the image of NFTs, resulting in token-level visual embeddings . Regarding textual content, we con-catenate various elements, including the collection-level name, de-scription, and all token-level property keys . To derive textualembeddings, we leverage a pre-trained sentence BERT model .Token-level Rarity Calculation. As revealed in studies , therarity of tokens strongly correlates with price differences amongtheir same collecions. For each collection , we denote its proprietyset as . We first calculate the rarity score of each property by =|||| , , where || denotes the number of tokens in collection and | | denotes the number of tokens that have the property .Then, the rarity score of a token is defined as = ,where is the set of properties of this token.",
  "Wallet Profiling Framework": "Wallet profiling aims to create a comprehensive profile of a digitalwallet within the NFT ecosystem. This profile encompasses a widerange of attributes and information about wallet holders, contribut-ing to the identification of correlations between their behaviorand the NFT price trends they interact with. In general, walletprofiling includes the following four key aspects: (1) Investmentexperience involves analyzing a wallets historical transaction fre-quency, total asset value, and profitability. It provides insights intothe wallet holders level of investment experience, as well as theirtrack record in making successful investment decisions. Walletswith more extensive experience may exhibit more sophisticatedtrading strategies and a greater impact on NFT prices. (2) Contentpreference examines the specific styles or types of NFTs that walletholders are most interested in. Understanding a wallet holderscontent preferences contributes to identifying trends in the popu-larity of NFT. (3) Social connections explore the latent relationshipsbetween wallets within the NFT ecosystem. It provides insightsinto potential collaborations, shared interests, or contrasting atti-tudes towards the same NFTs among wallet holders. (4) Behaviorpatterns focus on the dynamic trading strategies employed by awallet. This includes assessing how wallet holders react to pricefluctuations, whether they engage in speculative trading, or if theyadopt a long-term investment approach. Understanding these be-havior patterns is critical for evaluating how the actions of walletholders influence NFT prices over time. Based on this framework,we instantiate a model, namely COMET. As shown in the middleof , COMET contains four parts and we elaborate on eachpart in the following sections. 4.2.1Temporal Transaction Graph Construction. The NFT ecosys-tem is characterized by multifaceted interactions between walletsand collections, indicated by transactions. To model the profile ofwallets, we construct a temporal transaction graph. Specifically, wesegment transactions into daily time windows and build a series ofsnapshot transaction graphs. We present the transaction graph at day as G = (N, R), where N, and R present the nodes, andedges, respectively. N: G consists of two types of nodes, i.e., W and C, whereW refer to the users wallets, and C represent aggregated NFTcollections. For W, we consider the daily count of mint,sale, transfer, burn transactions, etc, as their dynamic features , to model the investment experience of wallets. For C, weconsider visual and textual content embeddings as static features of each collection, which combines the holding behaviour toacquire the wallets content preference. Moreover, we allocateeach wallet node and collection node a trainable embedding,denoted as and . R: There are two main types of edge, i.e., wallet to wallet andwallet to NFT, in transactions, where the former aims to capturethe wallets social connections while the later is to model thebehaviour patterns of wallets. A wallet can buy or transfer inan NFT from another wallet, which indicates two relations, i.e.,sale and transfer , between wallets. A wallet can mint, hold,and burn an NFT, where we denote these three relations as ,, and , respectively. Moreover, an NFT is also involved in thesale and transfer transactions between wallets, which presents",
  "KDD 24, August 2529, 2024, Barcelona, SpainTianfu Wang et al": "four relations, i.e., sale-from, sale-to, transfer-in , transfer-out,denoted as , , , and , separately. For the wallet to NFTrelations, we merge the NFTs to one node if they belong to thesame collection. This can relieve the data sparsity problem at theNFT token level (See Appendix A.3 for detail).Incorporating the four aspects of wallet profiling when con-structing the graph, we can learn comprehensive descriptions ofwallets through information extraction from the constructed graph.We summarize detailed features of transaction graphs in AppendixA.2. By modeling all snapshots within the time window as suchtransaction graphs, we obtain a temporal transaction graph thatevolves at the daily level. We denote it as {G | }.Our approach provides comprehensive modeling of the dynamicNFT ecosystem. It enables a holistic understanding of the interplaybetween collections and wallets, while also implicitly capturingcorrelations among collections. 4.2.2Global Community Detection. Within a dynamic NFT ecosys-tem, the transaction counts of wallets exhibit a characteristic powerlaw distribution, posing a significant challenge of data sparsity (seeAppendix A.3 for detail). Notably, transfer behaviour within theNFT ecosystem tends to exhibit a close relationship between thesender and the receiver wallet . For example, there may bedifferent wallets registered by the same user. These wallets tendto exhibit similar market sentiments and behaviour patterns. Tocapture these intrinsic connections among wallets, we establish aglobal wallet transfer graph, based on all historical transfers withinthe specified time window. In this graph, nodes represent individ-ual wallets, while edges indicate instances of transfer behaviourbetween these wallets. We measure the strength of the connectionsbetween wallets by considering the count of transfers as the weightof each edge. Subsequently, we employ the Louvain algorithm to conduct community detection within this graph, resulting in theidentification of distinct wallet clusters. These clusters are collec-tively denoted as , and each wallet is associated with a specificcluster . This approach enables us to reveal the inherentcommunity structure among wallets, and collaboratively considermarket sentiment and dynamic evolution at the community level. 4.2.3Transaction Graph Network. For snapshot graphs {G }, wepropose a transaction graph network to obtain the embedding ofeach collection and wallet. There are three components in thisnetwork, i.e., node embedding initialization, community-awareinformation fusion, and multi-behaviour semantic aggregation.Node embedding initialization provides the initial embeddingsfor each collection and wallet, which can be presented as follows:",
  ",0 = + MLP( ) + MLP( ), C,(4)": "where and are randomly initialized embeddings that will belearned through gradient descending algorithm.Community-aware information fusion is to address the sparsetransaction issue and perceive the community-driven collabora-tion and evolution.

Then, we concatenate each wallet nodeembedding and its cluster embedding and encode through MLPs, to integrate the community-level information, and obtain,0. When the context is clear, we unifiedly use to indicate em-beddings of nodes, i.e., wallets and collections, in the followingpresentations.Multi-behaviour semantic aggregation is to propagate embeddingsalong with the constructed multi-type edges to model the walletprofile and its influence on the price of NFT collections.

For each token , the fea-tures associated with each sale S include the sale price, ETH-to-USD exchange rate, and the collection-level price on that specificday, denoted . Given the heterogeneity of token content, varia-tions in price can exist even within the same collection.

We derive the token sale embedding as follows:",

Then, in the training of token-level task,the COMET parameters that are trained in the collection-level taskare frozen. We merely optimize the token-level predictor with themean squared error (MSE) loss. Moreover, to avoid latent overfittingissues, we include L2 regularization as an additional loss.",

For the collection-level task, wedivide the daily price time series of each collection into three sub-sets: the first 70% for training, the latest 15% for testing, and theremaining 15% for validation.

To capturehistorical trends effectively, we set the size of historical windowsto 14. Similarly, the token-level sale dataset is divided according tothe same proportions.Baselines. For the collection-level classification task, we com-pare COMET with three groups of baselines: (1) traditional machinelearning models, i.e., random forest (RF) , support vector machine(SVM) , and XGBoost ; (2) stock movement prediction mod-els, i.e., MLP, LSTM , temporal convelutional network (TCN) and attentive LSTM (ALSTM) ; (3) advanced time seriesforecasting models, i.e., D-Linear , and N-BEATS , Informer and AutoFormer .

We observe that removing any componentscauses the performance degradation of COMET, underscoring theindispensable contributions of each component to COMETs overallperformance.

This phenomenon canbe attributed to the fact that, beyond the transaction history, eachwallet and collection possesses inherent characteristics, such as thedistinct behavioural patterns exhibited by wallets and the uniqueattributes associated with collections. These inherent characteris-tics are also significant drivers of NFT price prediction. IDE moduleincorporates this personalization into the modeling process, facili-tating the learning of these unique characteristics from historicaltransactions. It enables COMET to achieve superior performance.",

This finding suggests that wallets with different assetvalues have various impacts on NFT price trends. The behavioursand decisions of wallets with larger asset values may potentiallyexert a considerable influence on NFT prices. Interestingly, visualembeddings exhibit higher importance scores compared to textualembeddings, which underscores the higher correlations betweenvisual content and NFT price heterogeneity.",

The key distinction between COMET and AL-STM lies in COMETs ability to harness the wallet profiling methodto extract NFT price-related insights from transaction behaviors.In this analysis, we set the prediction step to 5. shows theimprovements achieved by COMET compared to ALSTM acrossthese collections. We observe that COMET tends to achieve moresignificant performance improvements in collections with highertransaction counts. This results mainly from the fact that collectionswith higher transaction counts typically provide richer and morediverse data for COMET. This increased data availability allowsCOMET to better learn and capture the underlying patterns anddynamics of the NFT market.",

Additionally,the collection embedding from the transaction graph network inCOMET provides an overarching perspective at the collection level,integrating historical price trends and market sentiment changes.This combination of capabilities contributes to COMETs superiorperformance in token-level price prediction tasks.",
  "CONCLUSION": "In this paper, we have investigated an emerging application prob-lem, NFT price prediction. To bring clarity to this evolving field,we have provided a practical and hierarchical problem definitionencompassing collection-level and token-level tasks, which caterto the diverse practical requirements of investors. we also havepresented our NFT price prediction system, which includes robustdata infrastructure and advanced technical solutions. Furthermore,we have proposed a novel wallet profiling framework and instan-tiated the COMET model, enabling us to grasp the influences onNFT prices behind transactions. Specifically, we have developed atemporal transaction graph construction method that efficientlymodels the multi-behavior transactions within the NFT ecosystem.Building on this, we have designed a transaction graph network,automatically extracting both temporal dynamics and structuralinformation relevant to NFT prices. Then, we have introduced ahierarchical prediction approach to address the two-level predic-tion targets. Extensive experiments on two-level tasks have shownthat COMET achieved the best performance, which demonstratesits effectiveness and practical applicability. Furthermore, we havedeployed COMET from the perspectives of both the establishmentof the data infrastructure and the integration of practical products.

  "AAPPENDIXA.1Deployment Details": "We have deployed our system in Microsoft from the following twoaspects: the establishment of data infrastructure and the integrationof practical products.On the one hand, following the pipeline of data engineeringintroduced in .1, we have constructed an industrial-gradeNFT data infrastructure to automate the collection, preprocessing,and visualization of NFT-related data. As illustrated in (a),our data collection pipeline utilizes distinct crawlers interfacingwith local blockchain nodes and IPFS to acquire both on-chain andoff-chain data in real-time, respectively. Subsequently, we conducta series of data preprocessing, delivering high-quality data for theNFT-related products. Additionally, we have developed a compre-hensive data visualization panel, showcased in (b). Thisinterface provides real-time analysis of blockchain metrics relatedto blocks, contracts, miners, transactions, etc., enabling us to gleanvaluable insights into overall blockchain operations. This infras-tructure serves as the robust backbone of Microsoft NFT-relatedproducts, such as Microsoft crypto wallet and Web3 search, ensur-ing the efficiency and reliability of data flow.On the other hand, we have integrated the NFT price predictionmodel, COMET, into our flagship NFT product, PowerNFT, a plat-form tailored for building up branded NFT marketplaces.

  "A.4Implementation Details": "We build our neural network model with Pytorch and PyG library.We set the hidden size of neural networks to 64, the number of graphnetwork layers to 2. To alleviate overfitting problems, we set thedropout rate as 0.5 and the weight in L2 loss as 0.0005. Then, we trainit using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch sizeof 64. Regarding the baselines, for the traditional machine learningmodel, we implement them with scikit-learn library and use thegrid search method to find the optimal candidate hyperparameters.For deep learning-based baselines, we adopt the official sourcecode of D-Linear10, N-BEATS11, Informer12 and AutoFormer13, andimplement others with Pytorch. We integrate the dropout and L2loss and maintain the most hyperparameters same as our model.Especially, we grid search the learning rate among {1e-4, 5e-4, 1e-3,5e-3, 1e-2} for them and use Adam to optimize. All experiments areconducted on a Linux server with a single NVIDIA A100 GPU."
