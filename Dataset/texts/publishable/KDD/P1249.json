  "INTRODUCTION": "Fair lending laws and regulations abound in the developed world. For an example of what one maylook like one does not need to go any further than the US Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA).ECOA prohibits discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. It applies to any extension ofcredit, including extensions of credit to small businesses, corporations, partnerships, and trusts.The ECOA prohibits discrimination based on race or color, religion, national origin, gender, maritalstatus, age, receipt of public assistance money and so on.It would be a mistake, however, to equate non-discrimination with the overall fairness. Whilenon-discrimination is an important necessary condition, it is by no means sufficient. The merefact that an economic outcome is non-discriminatory does not automatically mean there is nointrinsic unfairness to it in general. Consider the following illustration. Few would disagree that,broadly across North America and Europe, racialized minorities are over-represented in low-incomecommunities. Few would disagree that low income people have less access to banking services,notably credit, and also have to pay higher insurance premiums in many cases. The bottom lineis then that racialized minorities end up paying more. The latter is a gross injustice and clearly anegative economic outcome, as most would agree. But, paradoxically, most would also deem thefact that poor people have to have less access to credit entirely objective and thus justified. Afterall, low income people objectively have low income, objectively default more often because theyobjectively have poorer credit histories, and all of this is because they objectively live poorer lives.It always seems more rational to try and tackle demonstrable, in-your-face injustices. Ensuringfair lending will probably land in the mandate of the banks credit scoring team. But it would beutterly naive to believe that a scoring algorithm, no matter how smart and artificially intelligent Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without feeprovided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice andthe full citation on the first page.

  "SOCIO-ECONOMIC SETUP: ENTFREMDUNG AND CAMBODIAN RICE FIELDS": "At this point, two key elements of the subsequent analysis need to be chosen. First, we will need asuitable socio-economic malady to tackle, such that is both abstract enough and yet more specificthan evil in general. Second, to resort to the systems engineering parlance, we need a good use case.Use cases in this sense are a technique for capturing, modelling and specifying the requirements of asystem . A use case corresponds to a set of behaviors that the system may perform in interactionwith its actors, and which produces an observable result that contribute to its goals. Except that, inour analysis, actors are interacting economic agents.To identify a systemic injustice, one does not need to go any further that the works of anindividual whose critical theories about society, economics, and politics have over the past centuryreshaped history on a global scale. This is Karl Marx. Most of the debate around Marxs theories hasbeen heavily politicized, which threatens to make any analysis a moot point, but his original worksoffer quite a number of candidate injustices. Entfremdung, which can be translated as alienationor estrangement, is related to the fact that, in a capitalist economy, the worker loses the abilityto determine the destiny of their work . They are no longer the director of their own actionsnor they can define relationships with other people or own items of value from goods and servicesproduced by their own labor. Although the worker is an autonomous, self-realized human being,as an economic entity this worker is a mechanism. The alienation of labor has been linked toself-perpetuating poverty in highly stratified societies as most citizens never own neither whatthey produce nor the means of production .Let us now transplant the labor alienation discussion to Cambodia at around the time the colonyof French Indochina began to grow. Rice has been cultivated by Khmer farm households in lowlandsof Cambodia for perhaps 3,000 years and probably longer in the uplands. The powerful kingdom ofAngkor which dominated the region from the ninth to the fourteenth centuries was based on the",
  "Computational Marxism and How It May Help Fat-Cat BankersKDD 21, August, 2021, virtual": "This comes at the expense of life expectancy initially, not in the long run as farmers workmore, enticed by the progressive pay; refer to b. However, as one may notice, the wedgebetween the two schedules is most pronounced in the mid-run, occurring roughly in generations 5to 20. This is baffling as the Capitalists rice production schedule shows absolutely no change inbehavior over the same time period. 5DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONSIn terms of how we compare countries in the real world, Entfremdung appears to be workingto societys benefit: the latter becomes more productive (GDP per capita) at no long-term lifeexpectancy cost. Capitalist gets duly compensated by amassing capital. As farmers tend to workconsiderably more when stimulated by the progressive pay, their earnings are much higher withthe Capitalist setup. So, on the surface, the latter is a clear winner.However, if one scratches the surface, important concerns can be raised, and those have nothingto do with the excess mortality in the mid-run. The concerns hark back to the fundamental fairnessquestion posed at the opening of this study. Is stratification fundamentally unfair and thus not apositive economic and social outcome regardless of how wealthy the society is in general? At eachpoint in time, Capitalists profits are higher than the value of the entire economys output. Whilefarmers grow objectively wealthier, the stratification grows rampant. Also, there is no inherentreason for it to exist as any member of society can play Capitalists arbitrageur role. Thus theapparent freedom of opportunity does not correct the inequality. In fact, wealth becomes nominalin a way: farmers still have to work more, and they do not live any longer.So what one may counter what is in it for the fat-cat bankers? Despite the titles explicitpromise, banking seems to be missing from the model. There is no intertemporal trade-off andhence there is no borrowing/lending nor saving in the simulated economies. Furthermore, strategicoutcomes for financial institutions are normally evaluated with no aid from agent-based simulation,but simply on the basis of customers profitability and attrition rates, and how those may react tothe projected dynamics of economic fundamentals.To respond to this claim, let us take a closer look at the economic arbitrage opportunity inthe model. The law of one price definitely gets violated. Risk-wise, rice price is the only sourceof uncertainty, and neither communal farmers not Capitalist are exposed to it by construction.What makes arbitrage possible, however, is the fact that Capitalist enjoys interest-free borrowing.Laborer wages need to be paid prior to selling the rice, and Capitalist is implicitly assumed toalways have disposable funds to do so. This is where the models simplicity actually works to itsadvantage, making it closer to the real world conditions. Larger, wealthier and more financiallysophisticated entities do normally have better access to credit, which is true of both consumercustomers and businesses. Last decade saw an unprecedented growth of a phenomenon dubbedshadow banking . Propelled by regulatory arbitrage and technological agility, bank-like entities,notably online fintech lenders, have made significant inroads into the retail market share of majorfinancial institutions. The shift is being decried by many in the industry; calls to regulate fintechssame as all financial institutions have been made, ostensibly to avoid a repeat of the 2007 crisis.What is left out of the discussion, however, is that, unwittingly, fintechs and other shadow bankingentities are also playing the socially-responsible, inclusive banking role that the regular financialinstitutions ought to be playing themselves. It is true, of course, that most fintech will not chooseto provide banking products to the most disadvantaged strata of population, but a few will. Andsuch an outcome should definitely be preferred to not serving those people, leaving them at themercy of quasi-legal loan sharks.Being able to simulate the complex dynamics of generations of interacting agents: citizens, banks,fintechs, and others in a way that multiple optimization objectives are present, with inclusion and",
  "EMPIRICAL MODEL": "The objective of this section is to provide a formal economic setup for the simulation of the evolutionof the rural commune and Capitalist models. In doing this, let us leave the buffaloes out, eventhough those would make a nice proxy for capital production input, and focus just on labor as aninput, and rice as the only output. Also, let us assume the rice field is infinite and thus can sustainan infinite population of villagers. This is what we are getting for the rural commune: Each commune member , = 1, 2, .., maximizes their utility, (,), + = , where isconsumption, is leisure, and is labor. Cobb-Douglas utility will be used throughout theexercise, (,) = log() + (1 ) log().",
  "The total revenue is driven by the quantity produced, that is, ( [(1) +]1),and the total cost is given by = ( [(1 ) + ]1)": "The Capitalists profits have no easy closed-form solution for the profit-maximizing; we will have to maximize the profits function numerically (implemented using a simplexmethod algorithm). While rice price now does enter the optimality conditions, the price issupposed to have realized by the time the wages are determined, so it is not a risk factor.",
  "An evolutionary algorithm implemented for this study generally follows the lines of an earlier onewe used in and is a special case of a generalized multi-objective evolutionary algorithm": "Let be independently and identically distributed Standard Uniform . Let the individual productivity parameters be distributed 2/ where the scale parameter > 1. This allows us to fine-tune the productivity in such a trial-and-error fashion that wedo not end up getting too much of an explosive growth in rice output. Let us add a bit of realistic noise by adding a Standard Normal (0, 1) shock to the individualoutput (). Let the price of rice be be independently and identically distributed 2 sothat the expected price is one in all time periods.",
  "Each pair gets to have a randomly chosen number of kids which follows the Poisson dis-tribution with one degree of freedom so that the couples expected number of offspring isone": "Some part of the population is set to die off after mating. A vector of probabilities of deathgets generated from the Standard Uniform. The vector is ranked in the descending order;then all members of the current population are ranked top down by the product of their age(i.e. the integer number representing their generation) and labor contributed at the currentiteration. With the ranked probabilities thus assigned, a Bernoulli variable gets generatedand theolder part of the population who have worked a lot normally gets removed.",
  "(b) Average life expectancy": "One hundred replications of the societys evolution were generated, 30 generation cycles in each.The reader needs to be reminded that, in a context of multi-criteria evolutionary optimization, anindividual is no longer a standalone candidate solution but more of a component to a collectiveone. The algorithm was implemented in R statistical software .Both societies growth results in an exponentially growing population, see a, as well asrice production, shown in b; however, the Capitalist society is noticeably more productiveat roughly the same population size. In fact, this kind of exponential growth was characteristicof the model under a variety of settings, practically any configuration which would not resultin the population dying out would feature it growing exponentially. Whether this aligns withhistorical data is debatable; the colonial period did indeed show a quadruple increase in the totalarea farmed .There is rapid capital accumulation in the Capitalist economy, see a. Given the averagerice price of one, our Capitalist is consistently worth more than the entire output of the society.",
