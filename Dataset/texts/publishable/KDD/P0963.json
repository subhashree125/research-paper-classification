  "Abstract": "Agriculture, vital for global sustenance, neces-sitates innovative solutions due to a lack oforganized domain experts, particularly in de-veloping countries where many farmers are im-poverished and cannot afford expert consulting.Initiatives like Farmers Helpline play a cru-cial role in such countries, yet challenges suchas high operational costs persist. Automatingquery resolution can alleviate the burden on tra-ditional call centers, providing farmers with im-mediate and contextually relevant information.The integration of Agriculture and ArtificialIntelligence (AI) offers a transformative oppor-tunity to empower farmers and bridge informa-tion gaps. Language models like transformers,the rising stars of AI, possess remarkable lan-guage understanding capabilities, making themideal for addressing information gaps in agri-culture. This work 1 explores and demonstratesthe transformative potential of Large LanguageModels (LLMs) in automating query resolu-tion for agricultural farmers, leveraging theirexpertise in deciphering natural language andunderstanding context. Using a subset of a vastdataset of real-world farmer queries collectedin India, our study focuses on approximately 4million queries from the state of Tamil Nadu,spanning various sectors, seasonal crops, andquery types.",
  "Agriculture serves as a pivotal foundation forglobal economies, engaging a considerable work-force and making noteworthy contributions to the": "Equal contribution.Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal Academy ofHigher Education, Manipal, IndiaDepartment of Computer Science and EngineeringDepartment of Data Science & Computer ApplicationsEnterprise Analytics & Data Science, Artificial Intelli-gence - Center of Excellence, Wells Fargo International Solu-tions Private Limited, Bangalore, India1Code available at: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in numerous coun-tries (Alston and Pardey, 2014). This is especiallytrue for developing countries, where agriculture of-ten forms the backbone of the economy, providingemployment for a large portion of the populationand significantly driving economic growth and sta-bility (Mosley and Suleiman, 2007).While playing a crucial role, the sector encoun-ters numerous challenges, especially concerningthe distribution of knowledge and accessibility toexpert guidance. These factors are essential forimproving agricultural productivity and sustainabil-ity. Overcoming these challenges through betterinformation dissemination and access to expert re-sources is critical for enhancing agricultural out-comes and ensuring long-term sustainability. Byaddressing these issues, developing countries canboost their agricultural productivity, foster eco-nomic development, and reduce poverty (Devlet,2021).In recent years, the rapid digitization of the agri-cultural sector, facilitated by advancements in In-formation and Communication Technologies (ICT),has opened new avenues for addressing these chal-lenges. Initiatives like the Kisan Call Center (KCC)in India have marked significant steps toward bridg-ing the information gap faced by farmers (Zhanget al., 2016). Nevertheless, limitations like networkcongestion, restricted operational hours, and theproficiency of call center agents emphasize the re-quirement for scalable and efficient solutions. Toboost efficiency and effectiveness in the agricul-tural sector, there is an urgent demand for advancedsolutions capable of addressing the various chal-lenges robustly faced by farmers.Conventional methods like manual surveys andon-site visits by experts, while beneficial, are fre-quently time-consuming and expensive (Jack, un-dated). The irregular resource allocation makes itchallenging to conduct these methods regularly, of-ten taking several days or weeks. This underscores",
  ": Flow Diagram of our methodology": "the need for an automated solution to promptly andefficiently address farmer queries. Historically, au-tomated query answering relied on keyword match-ing and predefined rules, leading to robotic andinaccurate responses. However, the recent emer-gence of Language Models and transformers sig-nals a transformative phase. Recent progress in large language models(LLMs) and autoregressive LLMs such as Chat-GPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Llama has demonstratedconsiderable promise.Through extensive pre-training, these models can produce high-quality,contextually relevant summaries that are both infor-mative and accessible. However, they come witha substantial computational cost and often requirefine-tuning for specific tasks, demanding signif-icant computational resources and energy (Khe-makhem et al., 2021). Sequence-to-sequence models present a promis-ing solution, effectively addressing these computa-tional challenges. Their encoder-decoder structureenables them to efficiently manage input and outputsequences, making them well-suited for tasks withsmall input-output sizes. Compared to LLMs, theyare more computationally efficient, requiring fewerresources for fine-tuning and inference while main-taining high performance and suiting some tasksbetter than causal models (Lei et al., 2018). Thesemodels also excel in scenarios where a specifictone, particularly one understandable to users inregions like developing countries, needs to be mod-eled. This is particularly relevant in regions whereusers are accustomed to a particular tone of En-glish and generally prefer shorter, more keyword-highlighted conversations. This can be challengingfor autoregressive LLMs when fine-tuned, as theyare pre-trained on a large corpus of English textprimarily contributed by people from America andEurope. This can lead to model forgetting infor- mation learned during pre-training, hallucinations,and subpar performance on downstream tasks.Significant progress has been made in develop-ing conversational AI interfaces tailored for vari-ous sectors, resulting in diverse solutions that meetthe specific needs of stakeholders (Dwivedi et al.,2021). However, there has been limited explorationin the context of agricultural use cases. In particu-lar, there has been no investigation into using LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) for Natural LanguageGeneration (NLG) to address query answering inthe agricultural sector. This work demonstrates theNLG capabilities of LLMs in automating queryresolution within this domain.Leveraging their proficiency in interpreting natu-ral language and understanding context, our studyaims to present a reliable solution to the challengesfaced by farmers in their daily lives.This re-search is pioneering in its application of LLMsfor sequence-to-sequence generation in the agri-cultural context. Unlike previous efforts that didnot fully utilize the advanced capabilities of LLMs,our approach harnesses these models for naturallanguage generation using a subset of an extensivedataset of real-world farmer queries collected inIndia. To enhance the quality and clarity of theanswers, ensuring they are understandable to theminority of youths with basic education involved inagriculture, we integrated a pre-trained foundationLLM (Kivisild et al., 2003). This model enrichesthe structure and corrects the grammar of the an-swers generated by our base model.",
  "Neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modelshave proven to be highly effective in handling vari-ous human language tasks and modeling sequentialdata. These models can process and generate hu-": "man language, starting with the basics of naturallanguage processing (NLP). Transformers, a signif-icant advancement in NLP, enable more efficienthandling of long-range dependencies in sequences.Seq2seq models, which build on transformers,encode an input sequence into a fixed representa-tion and then decode it into an output sequence.Large language models (LLMs) and autoregres-sive models, such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT, fur-ther enhance the capabilities of seq2seq models bygenerating coherent and contextually appropriatetext based on given prompts (Floridi and Chiriatti,2020). These sophisticated models offer a power-ful approach for improving agricultural knowledgedistribution and expert guidance accessibility by en-abling advanced data processing and interpretation(Neubig, 2017).The evolution of Natural Language Processing(NLP) progressed from seq2seq models like recur-rent neural networks to transformer models. Trans-formers revolutionized the field by enabling effi-cient parallel processing and capturing long-rangedependencies in text with greater accuracy (Malteand Ratadiya, 2019). Historically, automated queryanswering relied on keyword matching and pre-defined rules, leading to robotic and inaccurateresponses. However, the recent emergence of Lan-guage Models and transformers signals a transfor-mative phase.Trained on extensive datasets of text and code,LLMs showcase exceptional proficiency in under-standing and generating human-like language. Thispositions them as pioneers in automated query an-swering, providing unmatched fluency, dynamiccomprehension, continuous learning, and expertisein multiple languages. LLMs handle intricate ques-tions with nuance, decipher ambiguous queries,improve iteratively through user interactions, andsurmount language barriers.Despite ongoing advancements, challenges likefactual inconsistencies and biases necessitate at-tention. Nevertheless, the rapid evolution of LLMtechnology suggests a revolution in our interactionwith information, making automated query answer-ing more intuitive and advantageous.",
  "AgricultureTalkBot(VijayalakshmiandPandimeena,2019)employedNaturalLan-guage Processing (NLP) based query retrievalalongside speech synthesis to create a more": "intuitive and accessible platform for addressingfarmers questions, narrowing the knowledgegap.AgriBot (Jain et al., 2019) utilized theKisan Call Center (KCC) and other datasets toprovide guidance on weather conditions, markettrends, and government policies using sentenceembedding and Artificial Neural Networks forquery retrieval-based answering.The LINEchatbot in Thailand demonstrated the practicalapplication of these technologies in educatingfarmers about crop management, emphasizingthe significance of chat-bots in the evolution ofintelligent agricultural systems (Suebsombut et al.,2022).Farmer-Bot (Darapaneni et al., 2022) leverag-ing WhatsApps popularity in India to provide achatbot with RASA backend while utilizing theKCC dataset for the state of Assam, aiming to over-come limitations faced by traditional help centers.Farmers Friend (Venkata Reddy et al., 2022) devel-oped a similar multi-platform solution that aimedto help farmers through advanced NLP techniques.Recently, AgAsk (Koopman et al., 2023), took asignificant step by utilizing scientific literature torespond to intricate agricultural queries, highlight-ing the capabilities of information retrieval systemsand setting a new standard for AI applications inagriculture.",
  "Dataset Description": "In the realm of agriculture, timely and accurateinformation is crucial for the success and sustain-ability of farming practices (Vadivelu and Kiran,2013). Farmers frequently encounter challengesthat require immediate expert advice, ranging frompest management to crop rotation strategies (Rao,2007). Addressing this need for an efficient andaccessible solution, the Indian Ministry of Agricul-ture and Farmers Welfare initiated the Kisan CallCenter (of Agriculture and Welfare, 2004) project,where farmers can call to ask queries which will beanswered by domain experts.The dataset comprises real queries posed byfarmers and responses from domain experts. Itencompasses essential details such as the farmerslocation, crop type, nature of the query, and addi-tional pertinent information about the specific cropin question. This extensive dataset comprises morethan 32 million queries, spanning from 2006 to2023, covering all states in India. To align with",
  "Data Preparation": "In this study, we work with the queries based onthe geographic region of the state of Tamil Nadu,which contains 4 million records. we created asplit of 1% each for testing and validation. Dur-ing the split, we ensured an equitable distributionof various query types and crop categories acrossall subsets. The data cleaning process requiredsubstantial effort to remove extraneous data andaddress observed inconsistencies.Since the dataset consisted of transcripts ofphone queries, it contained numerous run-on sen-tences, complicating the parsing and comprehen-sion of the text. We thoroughly analyzed n-grampatterns to identify these blended phrases lackingclear boundaries. Due to the intricacy of the issueand the absence of an automated solution, manualcorrection became necessary. By carefully examin-ing n-gram patterns, we manually separated thesephrases in the samples, thereby enhancing the read-ability and structure of the dataset. The effects ofmodifications are detailed in .During the data pre-processing phase, our mainemphasis was on resolving abbreviations, ensur-ing case consistency, and handling data that com-bines numbers and text, with the numeric text re-tained due to its significance in providing contextand detail to the textual data. This thorough pre-processing significantly improved data quality andreliability, both qualitatively and quantitatively.Due to farmers preference for their regional lan-guage and their limited English proficiency, with a vocabulary mostly consisting of certain keywordsrelated to fertilizers, crops, and techniques, a largenumber of query and resolution instances in thedataset are grammatically incorrect.However,these queries are understandable to farmers andhave a regional tone, which helps them confidentlyaccept and understand the solutions, making themwell-suited for the use case. To improve the quality and readability of theanswers, which should be understandable by theminority of youths involved who have basic edu-cation, we incorporated a pre-trained foundationmodel (i.e., Gemini Pro ). This model enriches andcorrects the grammar of the answers produced byour base model, as shown in .",
  ": Qualitative Results from fine-tuned Flan T5Base": "shows some of the generated modeloutputs for the queries of the test set. Upon ex-amination, these outputs align closely with theactual solutions to the problems as suggested byexperts. This alignment indicates the models ef-fectiveness in generating accurate and relevant so-lutions, demonstrating its potential utility in real-world applications. highlights cases where the models out-puts do not perfectly align with the actual answersin the test set. However, it is evident that the out-puts are very close to the correct solutions, demon-strating the models potential usefulness for users.",
  "Model Development": "Our methodology can be observed in . Weemployed sequence-to-sequence modeling, specif-ically designed to transform small sequences ofinput data into corresponding sequences of out-put data, enabling the handling of intricate taskslike text translation, summarizing, and question-answering.The primary reason for using language sequence-to-sequence models for this task, rather than causalmodels, is their computational efficiency, result-ing in faster query processing times. Additionally,given the nature of the datasets, farmers or usersmay require a clear, one-shot answer to their agri-cultural queries, which seq2seq transformers caneffectively provide.To effectively prepare the model for the desig-nated task, we conducted fine-tuning on variousmodels such as BART (Lewis et al., 2019), T5 (Raf-fel et al., 2023), and Pegasus (Zhang et al., 2020a).We also included indicBART (Dabre et al., 2022)and a multilingual T5 model (Xue et al., 2021) inour study, as they are capable of handling multiplelanguages.The fine-tuning process entailed configuring abatch size of 64 and a learning rate of 4 105",
  "Enhancing Answer Tone and Grammarwith Pre-Trained LLM": "As previously noted, the dataset contains a spe-cific tone and may have grammatical errors sinceEnglish is not the primary language of the localpopulation in Tamil Nadu, and conversations mayemphasize keywords. Consequently, the generatedanswers might not be easily understandable to abroader audience.To address this challenge, we use a foundationalauto-regressive large language model to improvethe grammar and tone of the generated answers.This approach allows us to produce both a localversion and an easily understandable version for aneducated audience.For this enhancement, we utilized GooglesGemini Flash model, which significantly improvedthe tone and grammatical accuracy of the gener-ated answers. By employing this advanced tool,we produced coherent, professional, and beneficialresponses for the end users, ultimately enhancingthe overall user experience and the utility of ourmodels outputs. The specific prompt used for thistask was,",
  ": Enhancing the quality of generated answersthrough a foundation model for an educated audience": "the grade level required for comprehension basedon characters, words, and sentences, with higherscores signifying greater complexity. DCRS as-sesses readability based on familiar words, wherelower scores mean the text is easier to read.In evaluating interpretability as shown in Table 5, rephrased outputs with higher FKGL scores sug-gest that the text is more detailed and sophisticated,potentially offering more nuanced and precise infor-mation, which can be beneficial in certain contexts.Additionally, a lower DCRS score in therephrased output indicates that, despite the in-creased complexity, the text uses familiar words,making it more accessible and easier to understand.Thus, rephrased outputs showing higher FKGLand CLI scores and a lower DCRS score comparedto the models output demonstrate a balance of",
  "Results and Analysis": "We performed experiments with various state-of-the-art and baseline model architectures as de-scribed in section 3.3, and the results of fine-tuningare shown in . These quantitative resultswere obtained without using the Gemini API forrephrasing, underscoring the similarity in gram-mar and tone between the generated output and theexpert answers provided in the dataset.The Flan T5 Base (Chung et al., 2022), pegasus-xsum (Zhang et al., 2020a), and Bart-base (Lewiset al., 2019) models exhibited the most impressiveperformance metrics, demonstrating superior textgeneration capabilities due to their architecturaldesign and pretraining techniques when comparedto other models.To assess the consistency and robustness of theLLM models for the Query Generation Task acrossvarious distributions, we aimed to utilize meta-data. This involved a detailed analysis of the mod-els based on three key attributes: Seasons (Rabi,Kharif, and Jayad, which are local names for In-dian agricultural seasons), Query Types (such asplant protection, nutrient management, fertilizerusage guidelines for specific conditions, govern-ment schemes, and regional cultural practices), andCrop Sectors (e.g., horticulture crops like fruits andvegetables, and other agricultural crops). presents the performance analysis of our top fine-tuned model, Flan T5 Base, demonstrating well-",
  ": Results of Ablation studies with Flan T5 Base indicating Blue Score, Rouge Score, Precision, Recall, andMacro F1 scores for various meta-data subsets": "rounded results. The model exhibits consistentlystrong performance across different sectors and sea-sons, though some variability is observed amongquery types. Notably, queries related to fertilizerusage and nutrient management yielded the bestoutcomes.We saw consistent performance trends acrossdifferent attributes in all the models we developed,though with increased standard variation. Thus,we can conclude that its capabilities are robust andconsistent across almost all diverse scenarios.",
  "Conclusion and Future Works": "In this work, we harness the power of languagemodels for sequence-to-sequence text generationto aid in addressing farmer queries over the dataset,which consists of authentic farmer query conversa-tions with domain experts from the KCC dataset.Our approach involved rigorous data cleaning andpreprocessing to eliminate noise from the dataset,marking one of the initial applications of LLMsfor Natural Language Generation in this domain.The fine-tuned models demonstrate robust perfor-mance and effective generalization across variousattributes, resulting in high-quality text generation.By enhancing tone and grammar with pre-trainedlarge language models (LLMs), the rephrased out-put can be tailored to a more general and widereducated audience rather than just the local popula-tion. This approach has the potential to contributeto societal well-being by alleviating the workloadon conventional call centers and domain experts,providing farmers with immediate and contextuallyrelevant information.This, in turn, establishes the groundwork for amore inclusive and responsive agricultural ecosys-tem, ensuring universal access to vital knowledgefor all farmers and fostering a sustainable and pros- perous future for global agriculture.In future research endeavors, we aim to enhanceour proposed methodology by integrating metadatacollected alongside farmer inquiries to improve thetraining using Large Language Models (LLMs),enhancing their effectiveness.Furthermore, we plan to expand our work todiverse regions across India present in the KCCDataset, enabling a more comprehensive resolu-tion of farmers concerns and collaborating withregional languages relevant to offer more localizedassistance.",
  "Ethical and Societal Implications": "We examine the use of large language models(LLMs) to automate responses to farmer queries inIndia in this work. Given the crucial role agricul-ture plays in Indias economy and the livelihoodsof a significant portion of the population, it is vitalto consider the ethical and societal implicationsof deploying such technologies. We recognize thepotential benefits, such as enhancing farmers ac-cess to timely and accurate information, which canimprove crop management, increase productivity,and ultimately strengthen food security. However,it is equally important to carefully define what con-stitutes \"positive impact\" in this context.A crucial consideration is the accessibility ofthese technologies for all farmers, including thosein remote or underserved areas. The deploymentof LLMs must be inclusive, ensuring it does notworsen existing inequalities or exclude specificgroups. Integrating this technology with accessibleservices, such as phone-based systems, could beparticularly beneficial. Additionally, the accuracyand reliability of LLM-generated information areparamount, as incorrect recommendations couldlead to adverse outcomes for farmers. The use of LLMs in addressing farmer queriesalso raises complex issues of accountability andliability. It is essential to determine who is respon-sible if AI-generated advice results in crop failuresor financial losses and to establish fair systems ofredress. Therefore, a trial of such systems shouldbe conducted to compare their actual effectivenesswith user satisfaction. An expanded study incorpo-rating multimodal features, such as location, croptype, and season, could improve the model andimprove outcomes. Furthermore, this technologymay drive long-term societal changes, potentiallyreshaping farmer-consumer relationships and rural-urban dynamics as agriculture becomes more data-driven and efficient.We must also consider how this technology inter-acts with traditional knowledge systems. There isa risk that AI-driven advice could inadvertently un-dermine local, traditional farming wisdom passeddown through generations, leading to a homoge-nization of agricultural practices and a reductionin crop diversity and resilience. Balancing techno-logical progress with the preservation of culturalheritage and biodiversity will be a key challenge.In conclusion, while automating farmer queriesthrough LLMs offers promising opportunities tosupport Indias agricultural sector, it is essentialthat these efforts are guided by a strong ethicalframework. We advocate for a broad discussion onwhat constitutes \"positive impact\" in this context,ensuring that the benefits of such technologies areequitably distributed and contribute to the overallwell-being of the farming community.",
