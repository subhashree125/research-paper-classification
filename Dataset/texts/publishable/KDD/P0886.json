  "Introduction": "PageRank is a celebrated metric for assessing node centrality ingraphs, originally introduced by Google for ranking web pagesbased on their prominence within the web network . Overthe past two decades, PageRank has evolved into one of the mostpopulargraph centrality metrics, with widespread applications acrossdiverse elds. These include social network analysis , spamdetection , recommender systems , graph representationlearning , chemical informatics , and bioinformatics ,and more . The computation of PageRank has become a funda-mental aspect of modern network analysis.In recent years, the exponential growth in network sizes hassparked signicant interest in the eld of local PageRank estima-tion . This problem focuses on the ap-proximation of a given target nodes PageRank score, with the goalof exploring only a small portion of the graph. Various practical ap-plications illustrate the utility of local PageRank estimation. For ex-ample, in recommender systems, there is a growing need to quicklyapproximate the PageRank scores of individual users during on-line operations, as opposed to performing time-consuming globalcomputations of determining all nodes PageRank scores within agraph . Similarly, in web search scenarios, website owners whoare interested in enhancing their search engine rankings may onlyseek the PageRank score of their specic websites, not those of theentire web . Additionally, in social networks, users often desireto gauge their PageRank-based popularity by eciently probingthe friendship graph, rather than having to traverse the entire net-workr . Therefore, it is imperative to have highly ecientalgorithms for local PageRank estimation.This paper focuses on local PageRank estimation in undirectedgraphs 1. We aim to address the problem of computing, with proba-bility (1 ), a multiplicative (1)-approximation of the PageR-ank score for a given target node in an undirected graph com-prising nodes and edges. Both and are constants set withinthe (0, 1) range (e.g., = = 0.1). This problem is of great impor-tance from both theoretical and practical aspects.Theoretical Motivations. Existing studies on local PageRank es-timation can be broadly divided into two categories. The rst cat-egory focuses on the approximation of a single nodes PageRankscore on general directed graphs , while the secondspecically targets undirected graphs . For directed graphs,the best-known lower bound of min1/21/2max,1/31/3for 1Its important to note, as formally established in , that the PageRank scores inundirected graphs are not simply proportional to node degrees, despite common mis-conceptions to the contrary often cited in the literature.",
  "proximation can be improved tolog min,1/2by lever-": "aging the symmetry of PageRank vectors in undirected graphs 2.Here, denotes the degree of the target node in the undirectedgraph . We note that this upper bound is even asymptoticallybetter than the lower bound established for directed graphs. Thisencouraging result underscores the theoretical signicance and ne-cessity of exploring the complexity bounds of local PageRank es-timation on undirected graphs. However, the question of whetherthis upper bound can be further improved remains open due tothe lack of lower bounds for undirected graphs . To the bestof our knowledge, only a trivial lower bound of (1) has been es-tablished over the years. This gap in understanding motivates ourexploration in this area.Applications Signicance. Local estimation of PageRank scoreson undirected graphs is a versatile tool with a range of applications.A typical example is its use in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).The majority of GNN models are primarily designed for undirectedgraphs, aiming to derive low-dimensional latent representationsof all training nodes from structural and feature information. Amessage-passing mechanism is typically employed in existing GNNmodels for feature propagation. In particular, a line of research utilizes PageRank queries for ecient feature propaga-tion, where the initial feature vector serves as the preference vectorfor PageRank computations (as detailed in ). In these mod-els, feature propagation is essentially akin to computing PageR-ank scores for a selected group of nodes in semi-supervised learn-ing tasks, like community classication on a billion-scale graphFriendster , where feature vector entries are binary and thenumber of training nodes is small. Thus, an ecient local PageR-ank algorithm can greatly enhance the scalability of GNN modelsin these contexts. Moreover, the simulation of random walks inundirected graphs is a prevalent approach widely adopted in vari-ous graph learning tasks . While prior studies havedemonstrated the empirical ecacy of this method, they fall shortof providing a theoretical foundation for the optimality of gener-ating random walks in undirected settings. This paper establishesthat merely generating random walks from a specied target nodeachieves the optimal complexity for local PageRank computation.Our ndings aim to lay a theoretical foundation for the ecacy ofrandom walk simulations in undirected graphs, thereby informingthe design of graph learning methods tailored to such graphs.",

It is wellknown that () equals the probability that an -discounted ran-dom walk, starting from a random source node uniformly chosenin , terminates at node . Here, an -discounted randomwalk is a type of random walk where the length of the walk is arandom variable that takes on value with probability (1 ) for each 0.

  "Computational Model": "In this paper, we adopt the standard RAM model for computationalcomplexity. To establish lower bounds, we consider query com-plexity under the standard arc-centric graph access model ,where local algorithms can access the underlying graph only througha graph oracle via several local queries and a global jump() opera-tion. This setting aligns well with practical situations with massive-scale network structures. Specically, for undirected graphs, thegraph oracle supportsthree elementary query operations, each tak-ing unit time: deg(), which returns; neigh(,), which returnsthe -th node in N (); jump(), which returns a random node uni-formly chosen from . Algorithm 2 is an example on how to lever-age these query operations to sample random walks in the graph.The query complexity of a graph algorithm is dened as the num-ber of elementary query operations invoked on the graph oracle. Itis worth noting that the query complexity of an algorithm servesas a lower bound for its computational complexity.",
  "Related Work": "The problem of estimating PageRank scores locally was introducedin , and, in its various forms, has received considerable atten-tion over the past decade . Thesemethods can be broadly categorized into three groups based ontheir underlying techniques. A summary of their complexity boundsis provided in . In this section, we will briey review thesemethods. will delve into the limitations of existing meth-ods and oer a detailed comparison with our BackMC algorithm.The rst category is inspired by the probabilistic in-terpretation of PageRank scores. The seminal work by Fogaras etal. introduced a Monte Carlo (MC) method that initiates a se-ries of -discounted random walks across the graph , where eachrandom walk is generated from a uniformly random source nodein. The MC method calculates the proportion of walks that termi-nate at the given target node , utilizing this ratio to approximate(). To achieve a multiplicative (1 )-approximation of ()with probability 1 , the expected computational complexity ofthe MC method is upper bounded by (). This result is applicableto both directed and undirected graphs.",

Moreover, Bressan, Peserico, and Pretto have shownthat a lower bound of min1/21/2max,1/31/3elementaryquery operations is necessary in the worst case to estimate ()within a multiplicative (1) factor with probability (1) in di-rected graphs.

The RBS, BPPPush, and BPPPush methods are three excep-tions, each of which devises the original push operation. However,RBS , BPPPush , and BPPPush are tailored for generaldirected graphs and do not leverage the symmetry of PPR scoresin undirected graphs. This limitation prevents them from achiev-ing optimality in undirected graphs due to the dierences in localPageRank estimation between undirected and directed graphs.",

Analogously, BackMC consistently out-performs all baseline methods on all datasets in terms of both e-ciency and accuracy.

  "Experiments on Synthetic Graphs": "In this subsection, we evaluate BackMC and the competitors on syn-thetic ErdsRnyi (ER) graphs.Datasets. We generate four ER graphs, each comprising a xednumber of nodes ( = 100, 000). The rst graph, designated asER10, features an edge-connection probability of 10/ betweenany two nodes. In other words, the probability that any given pairof nodes in the ER10 graph will be connected is consistently setto 10/. This connection probability is sequentially increased to100/, 1000/, and 10000/ for the subsequent graphs, referred toas ER100, ER1000, and ER10000, respectively. As a direct outcome,the average degree of nodes in the ER10 graph is approximately10, while the corresponding average degrees in the ER100, ER1000,and ER10000 graphs are roughly 100, 1000, and 10000, respectively.Notably, we present the minimum degree (i.e., min) observed inthese four ER graphs in , which are around 1, 10, 102, and103 for each graph, in ascending order of connection probability.These variations in ER graphs serve as a basis to demonstrate thesuperior performance of BackMC across a spectrum of graphs dis-tinguished by diering values of min.

Specically, on the ER10 graph,BackMC is tenfold faster than both SetPush, Undir-BiPPR and RBS.This leading factor escalates from tenfold to a thousandfold. On theER10000 graph, BackMC exceeds the performance of all competi-tors by at least three orders of magnitude in query time for com-parable actual relative errors. Additionally, it is important to high-light that while the query time for competitor methods escalateswith an increase in min (thus attributable to the growing numberof edges), BackMC uniquely exhibits reduced query times as minincreases. This phenomenon underscores BackMCs exceptional ef-ciency and corroborates our analysis, demonstrating a negativecorrelation between the computational complexity of BackMC andmin.",
