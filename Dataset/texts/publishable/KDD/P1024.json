  "ABSTRACT": "In video recommendation, an ongoing effort is to satisfy users per-sonalized information needs by leveraging their logged watch time.However, watch time prediction suffers from duration bias, hinder-ing its ability to reflect users interests accurately. Existing label-correction approaches attempt to uncover user interests throughgrouping and normalizing observed watch time according to videoduration. Although effective to some extent, we found that theseapproaches regard completely played records (i.e., a user watchesthe entire video) as equally high interest, which deviates from whatwe observed on real datasets: users have varied explicit feedbackproportion when completely playing videos. In this paper, we in-troduce the counterfactual watch time (CWT), the potential watchtime a user would spend on the video if its duration is sufficientlylong. Analysis shows that the duration bias is caused by the trun-cation of CWT due to the video duration limitation, which usuallyoccurs on those completely played records. Besides, a Counterfac-tual Watch Model (CWM) is proposed, revealing that CWT equalsthe time users get the maximum benefit from video recommendersystems. Moreover, a cost-based transform function is defined totransform the CWT into the estimation of user interest, and themodel can be learned by optimizing a counterfactual likelihoodfunction defined over observed user watch times. Extensive exper-iments on three real video recommendation datasets and onlineA/B testing demonstrated that CWM effectively enhanced videorecommendation accuracy and counteracted the duration bias.

  "INTRODUCTION": "The rising of video content platforms have attracted billions ofusers and become more frequent in the daily use of users nowa-days . To satisfy users information needs and en-hance their engagement, developing accurate and personalizedvideo recommender systems is critical. It is essential to incorpo-rate various feedback signals that reflect users interests to achievethis goal. In the video scenario, watch time has been commonlyemployed as an indicator of user interest and can be leveraged toenhance the accuracy of video recommender systems .Like other implicit feedback signals (e.g., user click) in recom-mender systems, directly inferring the user interest labels fromthe watch time is also hurt by the bias problem. One crucial bias isduration bias; that is, users watch time is not only related to their in-terest but also affected by the duration (length) of the video .It has been observed that users naturally tend to watch for moretime on longer videos, making watch time no longer a faithfulreflection of the users interest.Existing approaches like Play Completion Rate (PCR), WatchTime Gain (WTG) and Quantile-based method (D2Q) re-gard duration bias as a problem of inconsistent watch time scalescaused by the video duration. The longer the video duration, thelarger the watch time scale, resulting in a longer average watchtime. Therefore, these methods group and normalize the watchtime according to the video duration, which keeps the watch timecorresponding to different video duration consistent in scale. For",
  ": Comparison between counterfactual watch time andobserved watch time. Users A and B have the same observedwatch time but different counterfactual watch times": "example, PCR directly divides the watch time according to the cor-responding video duration and then normalizes the watch time intointervals of 0 to 1. These normalized values are treated as estimatedlabels of user interest in downstream tasks. Since these methodsmitigating bias via correcting labels, they can be categorised aslabel-correction methods. In practice, both video ranking basedon user interest and accurately predicting watch time are crucialtasks. The advantage of the label-correction method is that it cannot only provide an unbiased estimate of the user interest scorebut also predict watch time through the inverse transformationof the normalization function. In contrast, other existing methods,such as the feature-based methods: DCR and CVRDD ,primarily focus on the unbiased estimation of user interest scores.While these methods have proven effective, they struggle to simul-taneously estimate both watch time and user interest scores aseffectively as label-correction methods.Although existing label-correction methods have shown effec-tiveness in some extent, we argue that there are still limitations. Inexisting methods, after the normalization, the completely playedrecords (i.e., the user watched the whole video) are usually treatedas the highest user interest, regardless of the video duration. Typi-cally, records with explicit feedback can reflect user engagementand interest to some extent. However, from the explicit user feed-back signals provided in KuaiRand dataset1 and WeChat dataset 2,we observed that user explicit feedback in these completely playedrecords does not align well with current methods. Specifically, shows the proportion of explicit positive feedback(i.e., like and for-ward) received by those completely played records, grouped bythe video duration. In existing methods , since the user hasfully watched the video, these completely played records shouldbe considered as indicating equally high interest. However, clearly shows that, on both two datasets, longer completely playedvideos have a higher proportion of positive feedback, even thoughthe short videos are also completely played.The results in suggest that even if users have watched theentire video, these completely played records may reflect varyinglevels of interest. Moreover, the shorter the video duration, thelower the user interest level that a completely played record canrepresent, as it corresponds to a lower explicit feedback proportion.This inspires us to derive a novel interpretation of the durationbias: There exists a potential watch time that faithfully reflects userinterest, which is truncated by the videos duration, thereby resultingin a duration bias.. As illustrated in , lets consider two users,A and B, engaged in watching the same video with a 30s duration.Both users have completely played the video, and their watch timesare recorded as 30s in the log data. However, after watching thesame video, User B exhibits a higher level of interest than UserA, thus appearing to be left wanting more. We then consider acounterfactual question: How long will the user watch if the videoduration is sufficiently long? It becomes clear that User A is lesslikely, or even unlikely, to extend her observed watch time. Thelogged 30s watch time for user A can sufficiently reflect her interest.Conversely, User B prefers exceeding her observed watch time.Since her information needs are not fully satisfied after watchingthis video, the logged 30s watch time cannot represent Bs interest.To this end, we argue that there exists a counterfactual watchtime (CWT) corresponding to user interest, which is partially ob-served due to the truncation by video duration. For incompletelyplayed records, the CWT equals its observed watch time, thus re-flecting user interest. For completely played records, the CWT couldbe longer than the observed watch time due to the truncation byvideo duration. The users true interest level could be higher thanthat directly inferred from the observed watch time.The CWT can explain the results in well: various CWTare truncated by video duration in an entirely played video. There-fore, the same observed watch time may correspond to variousCWT and thus cannot distinguish user interest level. Furthermore,the completion of shorter videos occurs more easily than longerones, exacerbating the truncation of CWT. This results in a morepronounced duration bias, impacting the accuracy of interest mea-surement based on watch time.To model the CWT and estimate user interests, we proposea Counterfactual Watch Model (CWM) that adopts an economicperspective to model users CWT. Specifically, CWM treats userwatching as a process of accumulating watching rewards, where themarginal rewards are indicative of user interest, and the investedwatch time corresponds to the user watching cost. At the time pointwhere a users marginal cost equals the marginal rewards, the userattains the maximum cumulative benefit, making her actively stopwatching. This time point corresponds to the aforementioned CWT.Then, a cost-based transform function is derived to transform theCWT to the estimated user interest. The duration-debiased recom-mendation model can be learned by optimizing a counterfactual",
  "RELATED WORK": "Video Recommendation. In the evolution from traditional videorecommendation to TV show, various methods have been devel-oped to enhance the user experience and accuracy of recommenda-tions. Park et al. introduced a system that incorporates timefactors and user preferences using 4-dimensional tensor factoriza-tion to improve recommendation accuracy. Cho et al. presenteda recommendation method that accounts for user feedback withinspecific watchable intervals to enhance user satisfaction with TVshow recommendations. Qin et al. proposed a model that iden-tifies and adapts to the behavior of multiple users interacting witha TV system, thereby improving the personalization of recommen-dations. Most research works have transferred from traditionalvideo to micro-video scenarios in the mobile internet era. Cov-ington et al. introduced the funnel architecture of YouTuberecommender system. They predicted the expected watch timefrom training samples with weighted logistic regression, whichutilizes observed watch time as the weight of positive samplesloss. Multi-task methods have been proposed to im-prove metrics such as watch time prediction, relevance of user-itempair, and number of video views together. Ma et al. extend themixture-of-experts architecture to multi-gate expert knowl-edge integration. Tang et al. proposed a shared learning struc-ture to address the seesaw phenomenon. Chang et al. proposeda plug-and-play parameter and embedding personalized networkfor a multi-domain and multi-task recommendation.Counterfactual Information Retrieval. Most information re-trieval systems consider users implicit feedback as a supervisionsignal to infer their true interests. However, implicit feedback isinfluenced not only by users interests but also by external factors.Consequently, user interest signals are often concealed within im-plicit feedback and remain unobserved. Researchers have drawninspiration from causal inference techniques and developedcounterfactual information retrieval technology to address the bi-ases inherent in implicit feedback. Previous work in counterfac-tual IR primarily focuses on mitigating position bias ,popularity bias , and selection bias . How-ever, duration bias becomes a crucial concern when it comes tovideo recommendation, which has been discussed in existing stud-ies . In contrast to our approach, current methods for correcting duration bias cannot effectively explain and eliminateduration bias.Click model in Information Retrieval. Modeling user behav-iors plays a vital role in enhancing the performance of informationretrieval systems. The ability to accurately model user behaviors al-lows a retrieval system better to fulfill users information needs .To this end, many models have been proposed to explain or predictuser click behavior in various contexts: cascade model (CM) ,user browsing model (UBM) and dynamic Bayesian network(DBN) model model users click behavior in desktop search-ing with different assumption; mobile click model (MCM) andF-shape Click Model (FSCM) further extend the understand-ing of users click behaviors on mobile devices. Moreover, Borisovet al. and Chen et al. develop the click model into neuralnetworks, which enable automatic dependency detection. Unlikethe above click models, the UWM proposed in this paper focuseson modeling and explaining users watching behavior since it is abetter quantitative indicator of user preferences in video feeds.",
  "COUNTERFACTUAL WATCH TIME": "In this section, we will first define the video recommendation prob-lem and the counterfactual watch time (CWT); then we will providesupporting evidences for our proposed CWT. We also present aneconomic view of the user watch behavior based on the watch costand reward. Finally, we point out the current methods limitationfrom the CWT viewpoint.",
  "Definition of counterfactual watch time": "The task of user interest and watch time prediction can be formal-ized as follows: Suppose U and V are the sets of users and videos,respectively. We can record user Us watching behavior onvideo V as D, = {x,,,,}, where x, R representsthe feature vector of the sample pair and is the feature dimension., R+ denotes user s observed watch time on video (e.g., inseconds), while R+ is the duration of video .Next, we will introduce a novel concept called counterfactualwatch time CWT, which is denoted as ,. As we have discussedbefore, the CWT can be defined as: Definition 1 (counterfactual watch time). For user andvideo , the CWT , R is defined as the time users want to watchbased on the users interest , if the video duration is sufficientlylong. There is no correlation between , and video duration . The CWT , corresponds to user interests. However, CWT, does not always equal the observed watch time, since it canbe truncated by video duration in practice3. Their relationshipis formulated as follows:",
  "The existence of counterfactual watch time": "Though the CWT is not directly observable from the data, we canstill find hints about the existence of CWT in real-world videorecommendation datasets. Next, we will use CWT to explain twophenomena presented in real datasets: (i) users repeated playingand (ii) the bimodal distribution of watch time. 3.2.1Evidence 1: repeated playing. In real datasets, we found thatusers may engage in repeated playing (for example, by rewindingthe video progress bar), leading to actual watch time that exceedsthe video duration. This phenomenon is often due to users high interest level in the current video. However, the videos duration isinsufficient to meet their needs, which is similar to our definitionof CWT. Since the definition of CWT necessitates a sufficientlylong video duration (Definition 1), in this study, we do not equaterepeat playing with CWT. In , we investigate the repeatedplaying in both the KuaiRand and WeChat datasets. Specifically, wefocus on two metrics: (1) repeated play proportion, which representsthe proportion of repeat played records within the current videoduration, and (2) average repeat play ratio, which reflects the averageextent of repeat playing within the current video duration, definedas (, )/. The results depicted in indicate that boththe proportion of users repeat playing and the degree of repeatplaying are higher for shorter videos and decrease as video durationincreases. 3.2.2Evidence 2: bimodal distribution. Another supporting evi-dence is the bimodal distribution of users watch time. For theoverall distribution of all the video playing records, existing stud-ies argue that logarithmic watch time obeys the Gaussiandistribution. However, when we focus on a given video duration(e.g., 30s), the distribution of observed watch time turns out tobe bimodal, as shown in . The bimodal distribution revealsthat most users skip over the recommended video or completelywatch it, while only a few users stop watching in the middle of thevideo playing . This abnormal distribution change is lessinterpreted by existing studies but can be well explained by theCWT. 3.2.3Explanation from counterfactual watch time. Without loss ofgenerality, we assume that CWT, obeys a Gaussian distribution.However, as we have mentioned in Eq. (1), all sampled , will betruncated by duration . Meanwhile, , will also be truncatedto 0 since all recorded watch times have to be non-negative. Thetruncated samples are assigned to or 0, respectively. As illustratedin (a), with the video duration increases, CWT experiencesless truncation on the right side, thereby reducing the tendency forusers to engage in repeat playing. Meanwhile, in (b), when theoriginal Gaussian distribution is truncated, it presents a bimodaldistribution, as we observed in the real-world dataset. Hence, CWTcan successfully interpret the above phenomenon, which in turnsupports its existence.",
  "An economic view of user watching": "To address the relationship between CWT and user interest, wemodel the users watch behavior from an economic perspective.The foundation of CWT within this framework is based on theconcepts of utility maximization and rational choice .This means users decide how much time to allocate to watchingvideos based on the perceived utility (satisfaction) derived from thecontent and their resource constraints. In accordance with theseeconomic principles, individuals allocate resourcesin this case,timeto maximize their utility. Utility can be seen as the rewardminus the cost. For users, the reward for watching a video is theinformation or pleasure derived from the video content, which isdetermined by their interest to the video. However, users cannotearn unlimited rewards, as they face resource constraints, such aslimited time. To illustrate the constraint, we introduce the concept",
  ": The economic view of user watching": "of watching cost, which refers to the overall effort and resourcesrequired to watch a video, including not just the value of timefor the user but also the users mental energy and attention. Thiswatching cost highlights that watching a video requires users toallocate their finite resources, which could have been spent on otheractivities.In summary, We assume that the users watching behavior fol-lows the underlying assumptions: Diminishing marginal reward: When the user watchesa video, the enjoyment or satisfaction derived per seconddecreases gradually, which is supported by the habituationphenomenon in the psychology filed and existing prac-tice . The initial marginal watch reward corresponds touser interest. Constant marginal cost: Since the watching cost is mainlyinfluenced by context factors, we can mildly assume thatcontext factors are not significantly altered during the perioduser watching video. Therefore, we consider the marginalwatch cost as a constant.",
  "Rational users: Users typically act rationally by maximizingtheir cumulative utility. Users will stop watching the videowhen the marginal watch cost equals the reward": "Based on the three assumptions above, we draw the marginalwatch cost/reward curves in (a) and the cumulative watchcost/reward curves in (b). The marginal curves are obtainedas derivatives of the cumulative curves. The figure shows that themarginal watch reward decreases monotonically while the marginalwatch cost curve is constant. When these two curves meet, a usersmarginal watch reward equals the marginal watch cost. At thispoint, the cumulative utility (i.e., cumulative reward minus cumu-lative cost) is maximized, as illustrated in (b). Formally, werefer to this time point as our proposed CWT. Our economic viewcan interpret the phenomenon in and : users interestlevel in a video is reflected by the time when they receives theirmaximum cumulative utility. When the video duration is too shortto achieve each users maximum cumulative utility point, userswith either high or low interest will completely play it.",
  ": Computational flow of the proposed CWM": "Theorem 1 (observed watch time is not the indicator of in-terest). For W R+, G, given : R W, we have 1 :W R, where W is the set of all observed watch time values, G isthe function space, R is the set of all interest probability values. The proof of this theorem is presented in our Appendix A. Thistheorem indicates that existing methods fail to uncover user inter-est in those completely played records, especially when the videoduration is short. The failure of current methods motivates us todevelop a CWT-based approach to address this problem and betterunderstand user interest.",
  "OUR APPROACH": "For better modeling the CWT and estimating user interest, wepropose Counterfactual Watch Model (CWM). Fig 7 illustrates theflow of CWM in the inference stage and training stage. At theinference stage, a recommendation model (), parameterized with, estimates the user interest , based on the feature vector x,.Then a transform function (), conditioned on user watch cost, converts the interest estimation into the CWT prediction ,.The actual watch time prediction , is obtained by truncating itthrough the video duration .At the training stage, to estimate the parameters in (), weemploy a set of user activity log D {D, = {x,,,,} : U, V}. For each D, D, the observed watch time ,is transformed into the supervision signal of user interest by theinverse of the transform function, i.e., , = 1(,;). Althoughwe use observed watch time , as the input of the inverse trans-form function here, we will approximate it to CWT in optimization.Then the predicted user interest , = (x,) is calculated withcurrent model parameters. For all D, D, comparing , and, jointly with duration derives the likelihood function L ().Thus, the learning of the recommendation model can be performedby optimizing L ().Next, we will elaborate on the design of CWMs key components:(1) the transform function () and (2) the likelihood function L ().",
  "cost = ,,": "where the (,) is the initial marginal reward that correspondsto user interest level ,, and is the user watch cost per second. Itis evident that the derivative function of reward is monotonicallydecreasing while that of cost is constant, which satisfies the as-sumptions in .3. When their derivative values are equal,we can derive a time point (i.e., CWT) for the maximum cumulativebenefit:d reward",
  "Counterfactual likelihood function": "Although we have proposed the cost-based transform function todescribe the relationship between CWT and user interest, we stillface the problem that CWT is truncated when the record is com-pletely played. We need to approximate the CWT by the observedwatch time to optimize our recommendation model. 4.2.1Formulation of the counterfactual likelihood function. Inspiredby the solution of survival analysis , we regard the observedwatch time distribution as the truncated distribution of CWT. Theoverall likelihood function of the truncated CWT can be written as:",

When , , the likelihoodfunction equals the probability that the CWT variable is truncated.As discussed in Theorem 1, we cannot find a transform functionfor indicating user interest from observed watch time. What weknow is only , , so we incorporate this prior in likelihoodfunction, allowing the models to determine the extent to which, should exceed .Maximizing Eq.

(5) to Eq. (7) can be found inour appendix. Finally, a duration-debiased recommendation modelcan be obtained through maximizing Eq. (7):",
  "EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS5.1Experimental setting": "We conducted experiments to verify the effectiveness of CWMon two large-scale publicly available benchmarks and a datasetcollected from an industrial video product. More implementationdetails can be found in Appendix B. More experimental results canbe found in Appendix D. The source code and dataset are availableat 5.1.1Datasets. The experiments were conducted on two publicreal-world datasets: WeChat and KuaiRand. They are respectivelycollected from two large micro-video platforms, Wechat Channelsand Kuaishou. We also conduct our evaluation in a large-scale prod-uct dataset from our video platform, which has tens of billions ofdaily active users. We list their statistic information in . Notethat we present each datasets completely played record percent-age in the last column of . Since the duration bias usuallyoccurs on those completely played records, their percentages in allrecords represent the severity of the duration bias of each dataset.According to the statistics, WeChat has the most serious bias, whileKuaiRand has the least bias. 5.1.2Evaluation. In this paper, we not only adopt our CWM forranking videos by user interest (i.e., relevance ranking) but also forpredicting users watch time. Both tasks are of great importance inreal video recommendation scenarios. As for the task of watch timeprediction, we utilize users actual watch time , as the ground truth, MAE(Mean Absolute Error) and XAUC were used as theevaluation measures. Note that XAUC evaluates if the predictionsof two samples are in the same order as their actual watch time.Such pairs are uniformly sampled, and the percentile of samplesthat are correctly ordered by predictions is XAUC. A larger XAUCsuggests better watch time prediction performance.As for evaluating the task of relevance ranking according to userinterest, considering that the user interest labels are unobserved inreal-world datasets, we defined user interests based on CWT. Givena (, ) pair, the user interest label is defined as:",

When a user watchesbeyond this time, we consider the user to be interested. The similaruser interest definition is also adopted in . We will discussthe unbiasedness of , in Appendix C. The , is used as theground truth for evaluating the relevance ranking task, AUC andnDCG@k are utilized as the evaluation metrics. 5.1.3Baselines. In the experiments, we compared the proposedmethod with the following baselines: Three duration debiased base-lines: PCR, WTG ,D2Q , D2Co ; Two watch time-weighted baselines: WLR and NDT ; And a naive baseline:VR (value regression) which directly fit the observed watch time.For relevance ranking task, we also provide the result of Oracle,which is trained directly with the label defined in Eq. (8) and de-note the upper bound performance of relevance ranking. Most ofthese methods are designed initially for relevance ranking or watchtime prediction via a transform function. For the relevance rankingtask, we directly rank the candidate videos via the predicted scoresoutput by the recommendation models trained by these methods.For the watch time prediction task, we first transform the predic-tion of recommendation models into the interval of watch timevia the inverse transform function of each method. Then we clipthe estimated watch time into 0 to as what we did in CWM.Two exceptions are WLR and NDT, which are implemented by atwo-tower model and have no inverse transform function available.Therefore, WLR is only used in watch time prediction, and NDT isused only in relevance ranking.To investigate the generalization of our method and the base-lines, we integrate them with different backbone models. Specifi-cally, we use recommendation models of FM , DCN andAutoInt as the backbone models. These three backbone mod-els respectively represent three types of feature interactions: innerproduct, outer product, and attention mechanisms.",
  "Overall performance": "We compared our CWM with other baselines in the three datasetswatch time prediction task and relevance ranking task, as shownin and , respectively. It can be seen that our CWMobtains the best performance on almost all three datasets, all back-bones and both tasks significantly. We also note that on WeChat,those methods equipped with duration debiasing (e.g., WTG andD2Q) perform even worse than the naive VR method. The reason isthat the WeChat dataset has much more completely played records",

  ": The relative improvement of each methods to VRon different duration bins of KuaiRand": "(45.5%) than that of KuaiRand (17.5%), showing that increasingcompletely played records make current debiasing methods getineffective. In contrast, CWM improved more on WeChat than onother datasets. The results also verified the motivation of this paper:Current methods regard all completely played records as the samehigh interest, violating real interest distribution in real data. There-fore, when the dataset contains many completely played records(i.e., records with truncated CWT), the performance of these meth-ods gets worse. Instead, CWM can model users truncated CWT toestimate user interest better and predict users actual watch time.",
  "Effectiveness on duration debiasing": "To investigate why our CWM is more effective on duration debi-asing than other baselines, we divided the KuaiRand dataset intoten equal parts with different duration ranges. Then we evaluateeach model on the subset of KuaiRand. The result is presented in. Note that the evaluation metric has different value scalesamong different subsets, so we report the relative improvementof each method to VR to show the extent to which these methodsaddress duration bias. The relative improvement is = 0",

Bottom two:relevance ranking task": "Fig 8(a) illustrates the performance of each method on the watchtime prediction task, measured by on XAUC. Fig 8(b) illus-trates the performance of each method on the relevance rankingtask, measured by on AUC. In both tasks, most baselines per-form better than VR in short videos (i.e., duration<30s), indicatingtheir effectiveness on duration debiasing to some extent. However,since they simply regard completely played records as equally highinterest, CWM performed better than them. We can find that thesebaselines perform worse in longer videos on both tasks. This is alsobecause they regard short, completely played video recordings ashigh interest, leading to underestimating user interest and watchtime prediction for longer videos. In contrast, CWM can modelthe CWT and assign fairer interest estimates to videos of differentdurations.",

The superiority of CWM is consistent acrossall datasets and backbone models. In conclusion, our CWM methoddemonstrates superior performance in mitigating duration biasby modeling counterfactual watch time (CWT), highlighting itseffectiveness in delivering more accurate and unbiased recommen-dations in short video recommendation systems.",
  "Ablation study": "We also investigate how CWMs two components benefit the CWM,i.e., the cost-based transform function and the counterfactual likeli-hood functions. The cost-based transform function estimates userinterest from the CWT, and the counterfactual likelihood functionoptimizes the model unbiasedly using the observed watch time.Specifically, we produce two variants for CWM. The first is denotedas CWM-C, which removes the cost-based transform functionand directly applies the original watch time to the counterfactuallikelihood function. The second one is denoted as CWM-L, whichreplaces the counterfactual likelihood function with a mean squarederror loss function. demonstrates the performance comparison between CWMand its variants on two datasets and two tasks. On KuaiRand, CWM-L obtains similar performances to CWM, while CWM-C has a sig-nificant performance drop to CWM. We argue that when CWT isless truncated (e.g., KuaiRand has only 17.5% completely playedrecords), how it is converted into an interest estimation can pri-marily affect performance. On WeChat, CWM-C obtains a similarperformance to CWM, while CWM-L has a significant performancedrop to CWM. We argue that when CWT is heavily truncated (e.g.,WeChat has 45.5% completely played records), how the observedwatch time is used to approximate the learning of CWT becomesthe performance bottleneck.",
  "Online A/B Testing": "To verify the effectiveness of CWM in real-world recommendationscenarios, we conducted online experiments in our commercial sys-tem, a popular platform with tens of millions of active users everyday. The baseline is a highly-optimized multi-task model deployedfor the product.Both the baseline and CWM were trained incremen-tally on the same anonymous logging data, and each one serves5% traffics, randomly selected from the same user group. As forshort video recommendations, improving customers mean watchtime (MWT) is the main target. Other metrics, such as averagevalid viewing volume (VV) and click-through rate (CTR), are alsoadopted. According to the online A/B testing results shown in Ta-ble 5, we can see that CWM does help users to entertain themselvesand spend more time watching the short videos.",
  "CONCLUSION": "In this study, we aim to counteract the duration bias in video rec-ommendation. We propose counterfactual watch time (CWT) forinterpreting the duration bias in video recommendation and pointout that the duration bias is caused by the truncation of the usersCWT by video duration. A Counterfactual Watch Model (CWM) isthen developed, revealing that the CWT equals the time users getthe maximum benefit from video recommender systems. A cost-based correction function is defined to transform the CWT intothe user interest, and the unbiased recommendation model can belearned by optimizing a counterfactual likelihood function definedover observed user watch times. Experimental results on three of-fline real datasets and online A/B testing indicate the superiorityof the proposed CWM.

  "BDETAILED EXPERIMENTAL SETTING": "In our paper, we briefly described the dataset used in our papersand the baselines due to the limitation of pages. Now, we put amore detailed experimental setting in this appendix.WeChat. This dataset is released by WeChat Big Data Challenge2021, containing the WeChat Channels logs within two weeks. Fol-lowing the practice in , we split the data into the first 10 days,the middle 2 days, and the last 2 days as training, validation, andtest set. We noticed that there is an unusually high proportion of60s videos among the dataset (17.3%), so our experiments were con-ducted on a subset of 60s videos that were excluded (i.e., the durationrange is [5s,59s] in the subset). The adopted input features includeuserid,feedid,device,authorid,bgm_song_id,bgm_singer_id,user_type.KuaiRand . KuaiRand is a newly released sequential recom-mendation dataset collected from KuaiShou. As suggested in ,we utilized one of the subsets KuaiRand-pure in this study. Tomitigate the sparsity problem, we selected data from which thevideo duration is up to 400s. We split the data into the first 14days, the middle 7 days, and the last 10 days as training, validation,and test set. The adopted input features include user_id, video_id,author_id, music_id, follow_user_num_range,register_days_range,fans_user_num_range, friend_user_num_range, user_active_degree,most_popular_tag, video_type,upload_type,tab.Product. We collect the product dataset from the server log ofour video platform, which samples the log data from June 19, 2023to June 25, 2023. Due to the data imbalance, we intercepted therecords below 42 seconds as the final training set. We trained ourmodel on this dataset and tested them in the last two hours of serverlog data. The pretrained ID embedding and side information areused as feature inputs for all methods.In this study, we implement WLR following the details in .For D2Q, the group number is set to 60 in KuaiRand, 30 in WeChat,and 10 in our Product dataset. For NDT, we set its hyper-parametersas the author suggested in their paper . For D2Co, the windowsize and sensitivity-controlled term are set as suggested in their",
  ": (Left) The proportion of user interest labels ,and (Right) The proportion of explicit feedback when , = 1grouped by video duration on (a) KuaiRand and (b) WeChat": "paper . We utilize Adam as the optimizer and set the initiallearning rate as 54 for all methods. The batch size is set as 512. Forall the backbone models, we set their latent embedding dimensionto 10. For all methods with neural networks, the hidden units areset to 64 while the dropout ratio is set to 0.2. The value of user cost and in our CWM is set to (1/40, 2) in the KuaiRand dataset,(1/40, 20) in the WeChat dataset, and (1/5, 5) in the Product dataset.We tune our hyperparameters on the validation set while evaluatingthe performance on the test set.",
  "To evaluate the performance of relevance ranking tasks in this study,we need an unbiased indicator of user interest first. However, the": "user interest labels are unobserved in real-world datasets. Althoughexplicit feedback can reflect user interest and is not affected byduration bias, it suffers from severe selection bias and noise : this indicates that users might not provide explicit feedbackfor videos they like and might mistakenly provide explicit feedbackfor videos they dislike. Therefore, using explicit feedback as a labelfor evaluating relevance ranking tasks is inappropriate. To this end,we defined user interests based on CWT in Eq. (8). However, theunbiasedness of this interest label still needs to be discussed.To achieve duration unbiased, the user interest indicator ,needs to fulfill two characteristics: (1) it should be independentof video duration, and (2) when , = 1, user explicit feedbackshould be equivalent across all video duration (thus mitigating theissue described in Fig 1). To verify whether our interest indicatordefined in Eq. (8) satisfies the above characteristics, we calculate theproportion of user interest labels , and the proportion of explicitfeedback when , = 1 grouped by video duration. Note that sincevideos shorter than 0.7 cannot achieve a watch time of 0.7, weexclude these videos from our analysis. The results are presented inFig 10. It is evident that our defined , roughly satisfies the abovetwo characteristics on both the KuaiRand and WeChat datasets,thus indicating its unbiasedness.",
  "DMORE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTSD.1Parameter sensitivity": "There are two hyper-parameters in the proposed CWM: one is theuser watch cost in the cost-based transform function (Eq. (3)). Thelarger the , the more sensitive users are to watch time; Anotheris the variance term of user interest in counterfactual likelihoodfunction (Eq (6)). The larger the value of , the more dispersed theusers interest distribution is. illustrates the performancechanges of recommendation with different values of and . Forwatch time prediction ((a)), the best hyper-parameter is (1.0, 2.0) (1/40, 1/20); For relevance ranking ((b)), thebest hyper-parameters is (2.0, 5.0) (1/80, 1/60). Note thatthe best hyper-parameters of two tasks may not be the same. Inpractice, it is necessary to adjust the hyper-parameters to makeCWM perform best.",
  "D.2Better fit to the true watch time distribution": "We examine whether CWM can fit the true watch time distribution.As a comparison, we also present the estimated watch time distribu-tion by PCR, which is representative of existing debiasing methods.Fig 12(a) shows the true and estimated watch time distribution onvideos with less than 100s duration on KuaiRand. We can find thatthe estimated watch time distribution by PCR is more flatteningthan the true distribution. It overestimates higher watch time (i.e.,>10s). In contrast, our CWM can fit the true distribution even better.Fig 12(b) shows the true and estimated watch time distribution onvideos with 30s duration on KuaiRand. It can be found that PCRonly estimates a single-peaked distribution which differs signifi-cantly from the true bimodal distribution. In comparison, CWMcan estimate a similar bimodal distribution to the true distribution,demonstrating CWMs effectiveness in watch time prediction."
