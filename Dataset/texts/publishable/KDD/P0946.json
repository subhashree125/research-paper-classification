  "ABSTRACT": "In a two-sided marketplace, network effects are crucial for com-petitiveness, and platforms need to retain users through advancedcustomer relationship management as much as possible. Maintain-ing numerous providers stable and active presence on the plat-form is highly important to enhance the marketplaces scale anddiversity. The strongest motivation for providers to continue us-ing the platform is to realize actual profits through sales. Then,we propose a personalized promotion to increase the number ofsuccessful providers with sales experiences on the platform. Themain contributions of our research are twofold. First, we introducea new perspective in provider management with the distributionof successful sales experiences. Second, we propose a personal-ized promotion optimization method to maximize the number ofproviders sales experiences. By utilizing this approach, we ensureequal opportunities for providers to experience sales without be-ing monopolized by a few providers. Through experiments usingactual data on coupon distribution, we confirm that our methodenables the implementation of coupon allocation strategies thatsignificantly increase the total number of providers having salesexperiences.",

  "INTRODUCTION": "In the evolving landscape of two-sided marketplaces, the dynam-ics between supply side (e.g., listers in Airbnb, drivers in Uber,providers in flea market apps) and demand side (e.g., travelers, cus-tomers, consumers) play a pivotal role in shaping the competitiveadvantage and sustainability of the platform. Unlike traditionalbusiness-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce services, two-sided mar-ketplaces have a unique challenge: the platform cannot directlycontrol the supply side, but it must rely on the voluntary participa-tion of individual providers.The success of two-sided marketplaces depends significantly onthe platforms ability to utilize and amplify network effects, wherethe value of the service increases as more participants join thenetwork . This characteristic necessitates innovative customerrelationship management (CRM) to enhance provider lifetime value(LTV), thereby ensuring a steady and diversified supply to meet thegrowing demands of the marketplace. The CRM strategies differfrom service to service. In this paper, we especially discuss serviceswhere actual product sales occur, such as online flea market apps(e.g., eBay, Etsy), rather than other two-sided market services, suchas social network services.There are various strategies to increase provider LTV , suchas providing tools that enhance their business operations, offering",

  "RELATED WORK2.1Coupon allocation": "Albert and Goldenberg utilized uplift modeling estimations forpersonalized promotions and discount optimization in an onlinee-commerce setting. They focused on purchase completion andincremental revenue as objective values and solved the optimiza-tion problem as a multiple-choice knapsack problem. While otherstudies have also addressed personalized promotions and discountoptimization using uplift modeling , their emphasis is onmaximizing short-term metrics like purchase completion during thepromotion period. Retaining users in the long term is essential formaintaining a competitive advantage in a two-sided marketplace.Yang, Li, and Jobson proposed personalized promotions opti-mization with direct and enduring effect prediction to evaluate thepromotional effect even after the promotion period. They enhanceddirect and enduring response training by applying a multi-tasklearning framework. However, they formulated promotion opti-mization for consumers, which can not directly apply to CRM forproviders who usually have multiple items in our two-sided mar-ketplace scenario.We propose personalized promotions optimization for providersusing an uplift modeling framework in two-sided marketplaces. Bysetting the probability of provider sales experiences as the targetvariable, we aim to offer a value proposition to a larger number ofproviders as a platform, ultimately leading to medium to long-termretention of providers.",
  "Fair recommendation": "Fairness can vary in definition depending on the characteristics ofthe service and the stakeholders involved. Wang et al. providedan overview of recent studies and gave an organized classificationof fairness. Fairness can be distinguished based on the means andobjectives. In terms of means, it is divided into process fairnessand outcome fairness. Regarding objectives, it depends on whichfairness of the subject is to be guaranteed. The problem we areaddressing in this paper focuses on outcome fairness for providers.While there are several studies on item fairness in two-sided mar-ketplaces , there are few prior studies addressing providerfairness. Burke and Abdollahpouri and Burke categorizedthe provider fairness as the item fairness at the group level. How-ever, they did not provide specific formulations of provider fairnessand evaluations.",
  "Strategic Coupon Allocation for Increasing ProvidersSales Experiences in Two-sided MarketplacesTSMO KDD24, August, 2024, Barcelona, Spain": ": The number of treated providers: Provider unitGreedy (P-Greedy) model focuses on treating more providerswith the same number of coupons. On the other hand,the SER model treats fewer providers and boldly allocatescoupons to the same providers to maximize their conversionrates. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have consideredwhether or not having successful experiences is a fairness metricfor providers. Furthermore, this paper is the first to aim to maxi-mize the total number of successful providers within the couponallocation framework instead of opportunity fairness based solelyon rankings to boost item views. Through experiments with realdata, we verified that our proposed method is more efficient inpromoting successful providers than models aiming to maximizeitem sale rates.",
  "Coupon effect estimation": "Uplift modeling is a predictive modeling approach designed toforecast the net impact of a specific action on a particular outcome. We employ meta learners , which merge machine learningand causal inference to estimate the conditional average treatmenteffect (CATE).For each item, let denote a vector of predictor variables, and () denote an outcome variable where a coupon is allocated when = 1 and no coupon is allocated when = 0. The CATE, the effectof a coupon on an item with the data = , is given by",
  "Providers sales experience rate": "We define the coupon effect based on the item sale rate, whichmeans 1() shows an item sale rate with a coupon. Here, weintroduce a metric representing the probability of a provider expe-riencing at least one sale. Note that the () is an item unit effect,while we aim to pursue a provider unit effect.As shown in , we assume that a provider has a set ofitems and a vector z {0, 1}| | represents whether each item isallocated a coupon or not. Then, the provider Sales Experience RateSER(, zs) is then given by taking the complement of the probabilitythat no items are sold:",
  "() {0, 1}( , )": "Since the number of combinations grows exponentially with thenumber of items held by providers, we reduce the number of com-binations from 2| | to | | by imposing a constraint to intervene indescending order of the items sales rate uplift of the items ()for each provider in the numerical experiments. For example, if theintervention is limited to only one coupon per user, assigning thecoupon to the item with the highest uplift would result in the high-est overall uplift. Similarly, with two coupons available, targetingthe top two performing items with the highest uplift could be advan-tageous, rather than selecting other combinations such as the firstand third highest uplift items. Therefore, such a coupon allocationconstraint may have minimal impact on the overall effectiveness ofuplift.",
  "Integer linear programming transformation": "The uplift model with SER has a non-linearity on the shape of theobjective function (, zs). By listing out all possible patterns ofcoupon allocation zs, the problem can be reformulated as integerlinear programming.Let = {1, 2, . . . , 2| |} denote the index set corresponding toa set of 0-1 assignment for zs (i.e., a set of all patterns of couponallocation). For each , let zs() denote the -th 0-1 assign-ment. Let () denote the binary variable that takes one if acoupon allocation pattern is chosen and zero otherwise, and () represent the number of allocated coupons correspondingto provider and an allocation pattern . By computing () = (, ()) a priori and treating it as a constant value, theinteger linear programming is then given as follows:",
  "Dataset": "We use real-world data of digital coupons on an online marketplaceapp operated by Mercari Inc., Japans largest C2C marketplaceservice. Our dataset consists of multiple iterations conducted ondifferent weeks of February 2024, with approximately 2 millionproviders and several million coupons. The coupons are distributedrandomly to each item of targeted providers, i.e., it is a RandomizedControl Trial (RCT) among the targeted providers. Naturally, thereare instances where multiple coupons are allocated to a singleprovider for various items. We use a single type of coupon andobserve whether each item is sold within one week after the couponis distributed.In this paper, we use data from four iterations of experiments.We train a T-learner with LightGBM using data from thefirst two iterations. We train it using 21 features, such as recentview counts, comment numbers, item categories, etc. The remainingtwo iterations are used as test data. However, for computationalefficiency, we perform a random sampling of 10,000 providers fromeach test data and calculate each performance metric ( - 5).",
  "Evaluation methodology": "We define two types of evaluation metrics. First, we define theuplift in the number of items sold, which is the focus of item-levelalgorithms such as I-Greedy or the NSW model. Second, we definethe uplift in the number of successful providers, which is the targetmetric for provider-level algorithms such as P-Greedy or the SERmodel.In RCT, we can obtain unbiased estimates of the metrics byincluding only the records in which the action taken (i.e., receivinga coupon or not) aligns with the random assignment of treatmentsin the RCT. shows the types of item sets. In the appendix,we prove that the evaluation metrics to be introduced are unbiasedestimators of CATE in the RCT scenarios.",

  "Evaluation metrics are computed using two iterations of test data": "4.4.1With respect to the number of items sold. shows thatthe item unit greedy algorithm outperforms in terms of the uplift inthe number of items sold. This superiority can be attributed to thefact that the item unit greedy algorithm is designed to maximizethe item sales rate, not the successful provider rate.From another perspective, the NSW model tends to have a smalleruplift in the number of items sold than the SER model. This canbe attributed to the NSW models characteristic of having the ob-jective function a product of the item sales rates, making it moresusceptible to interventions on items with low sales rates. Increas-ing interventions on such items may not eventually lead to actualsales. 4.4.2With respect to the number of successful providers. Looking atthe uplift in the number of successful providers, as shown in , SER models outperform the item unit greedy model regarding thenumber of successful providers. We can also see that the minimumitem quality assurance plays a particularly crucial role in the SERmodels. shows that without this assurance (SER modelwith Q=0%), the model only achieves performance close to the itemunit greedy model. Conversely, when this assurance is included, the",
  "CONCLUSION": "We highlighted the importance of retaining providers in a two-sided market to sustain a competitive edge with network effects.Our proposed promotion optimization model aims to maximizethe total number of successful providers who experience at leastone sale, thereby contributing to provider retention. To addressthe practical challenge of limited access to commercial nonlinearsolvers, we reformulated the optimization model as an integer linearprogramming problem. Additionally, we observed an enhancementin model performance by incorporating item quality assurancepreprocessing to handle the spread in item quality in a two-sidedmarketplace.",
