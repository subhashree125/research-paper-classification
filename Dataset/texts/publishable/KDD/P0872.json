Le, Chu Myaet Thwal, Chaoning Zhangand Choong Seon Hong, Fellow, IEEE": "AbstractIn this paper, cyber-attack prevention for theprosumer-based electric vehicle (EV) charging stations (EVCSs)is investigated, which covers two aspects: 1) cyber-attack detec-tion on prosumers network traffic (NT) data, and 2) cyber-attackintervention. To establish an effective prevention mechanism, sev-eral challenges need to be tackled, for instance, the NT data perprosumer may be non-independent and identically distributed(non-IID), and the boundary between benign and malicioustraffic becomes blurred. To this end, we propose an edge-assistedfederated prototype knowledge distillation (E-FPKD) approach,where each client is deployed on a dedicated local edge server(DLES) and can report its availability for joining the federatedlearning (FL) process. Prior to the E-FPKD approach, to enhanceaccuracy, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient is adopted forfeature selection. Regarding the proposed E-FPKD approach, weintegrate the knowledge distillation and prototype aggregationtechnique into FL to deal with the non-IID challenge. To addressthe boundary issue, instead of directly calculating the distancebetween benign and malicious traffic, we consider maximizingthe overall detection correctness of all prosumers (ODC), whichcan mitigate the computational cost compared with the formerway. After detection, a rule-based method will be triggered ateach DLES for cyber-attack intervention. Experimental analysisdemonstrates that the proposed E-FPKD can achieve the largestODC on NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and IoTID20 datasets in bothbinary and multi-class classification, compared with baselines.For instance, the ODC for IoTID20 obtained via the proposedmethod is separately 0.3782% and 4.4471% greater than Fed-Proto and FedAU in multi-class classification. 2024 IEEE.

  "Index TermsCyber-attack prevention, prosumer-based EVcharging stations, non-IID data, federated prototype knowledgedistillation": "I. INTRODUCTIONAT present, electric vehicles (EVs) have gradually pene-trated into our daily lives, which have the potential toreduce the emissions of greenhouse gas thereby protecting theenvironment . Specifically, there may be around 125 millionEVs being expected to be on the road by 2030 . By 2040,EVs will account for 55% of the new global vehicle salesand 33% of vehicles on the road estimated by Bloomberg .Owing to the penetration of EVs, the demand for chargingfacilities has also gradually surged. To this end, prosumerswhich can be regarded as EV charging stations (EVCSs) are focused in this article. Particularly, we concentrate on thesmart meter-equipped prosumers. Nevertheless, smart metersare easy to suffer from cyber-attacks , despite their tamper-detection and encrypted communication capabilities . Dueto this defect, attackers are capable of hacking into the meters. When the meters are hacked, the energy consumptionreadings can be tampered which can result in electricity billreduction , leading to vast economic losses for the powerutilities all over the world . Hence, it is pivotal important toprevent cyber attacks on prosumer-based EV charging stationsthat are equipped with smart meters.To prevent the cyber attacks, it is necessary to identify thecyber attacks, which can be achieved by detecting the networktraffic (NT) data. However, as cyber-attacks continue to growin sophistication and the boundary between maliciousand benign traffic becomes fuzzy , detecting cyber-attacksremains a huge challenge. Thus, a method that can identifycyber-attacks as accurately as possible needs to be designed.Centralized learning method has the potential to detect the net-work traffic (NT) for the prosumer-based EV charging stations.However, this method requires the centralized collection of NTdata from each distributed prosumer, which may arouse dataprivacy issue . Thanks to federated learning (FL) which isa privacy-preserving decentralized method , handling thatissue becomes possible since FL can train a model withouttaking the data off-premises. Nevertheless, network trafficdata of all prosumers may be non-independent and identicallydistributed (non-IID), which may cause FL performance degra-dation . Besides, in practice, it is unrealistic to presumeall the clients can always serve the training process .",
  "JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 20212": "Thus, there may exist a phenomenon that some clients maybe reluctant to participate in the training process.To this end, to address the aforementioned issues, an edge-assisted federated prototype knowledge distillation (E-FPKD)approach is proposed for cyber attack prevention towardsprosumer-based EVCSs. To be specific, through the proposedmethod, firstly, cyber-attacks will be detected by using thenetwork traffic (NT) data. Secondly, the detected cyber attackswill be intervened via rule-based method at each edgeserver. Additionally, prior to the proposed E-FPKD approach,since feature selection process can increase the accuracy ,feature selection with Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)is adopted. For the proposed E-FPKD approach, it is designedbased on the FL framework so that it permits each clientcan join in the training process without letting its local dataleave the local side. Thus, the data privacy concern regardingsubmitting data to a central place can be solved. In addition,considering the non-IID NT data, we employ knowledge dis-tillation (KD) for each client, owing to the following benefits:1) its easiness of implementation in any off-the-shelf deeplearning (DL) architecture without the need for extra softwareor hardware , 2) applying KD into FL is an effectivemethod to deal with the data heterogeneity . In addition toKD, we also employ the prototype aggregation mechanism intothe considered FL framework, because of its supportabilityfor heterogeneous clients . Finally, rule-based method istriggered to intervene the detected attacks. To be friendly, theclients willingness for joining the FL process (i.e., participat-ing availability per client) is additionally integrated.The cyber-attack prevention (cyber attack detection and in-tervention), KD, and prototype aggregation have been studiedby some previous studies, respectively. For ease of under-standing, brief summary of several previous studies and thisarticle are conducted. The detailed contents will be illustratedin Section II. In regard to the cyber-attack detection for EVCS,, were proposed. However, none of them considerintegrating KD technique and prototype aggregation into FLframework to prevent cyber attacks on prosumer-based EVcharging stations. Cyber-attack intervention was considered by, , . Particularly, the preventive event was adoptedby for Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacksprevention, the expert-based intervention was employed by, and the vulnerability assessment and penetration testingwas proposed by for cyber attack prevention, whichdiffer from this work. In , KD approach has beenconsidered. Specifically, with respect to , the typeof KD adopted by those three studies are different from thiswork. In the case of , although a mentor network anda mentee network are considered for building each client,prototype aggregation is not utilized. For , variousKD-based FL approaches were proposed for intrusion detec-tion, while the study aims to detect the energy theftvia the method that incorporates FL with KD and modelcontrastive learning. However, none of them consider theprototype aggregation approach. In regard to , despiteall of them introducing the prototype aggregation technique,none of them simultaneously introduce feature selection, clientavailability reported by the client itself, KD, and prototype aggregation to detect the cyber attacks towards the prosumer-based EV charging stations. Thus, unlike , , , , and , we comprehensively employfeature selection and meanwhile, integrate client availabilityand KD along with prototype aggregation in FL to detectthe cyber-attacks for the prosumer-based EVCSs, while weadopt rule-based approach to intervene in the cyber-attacks.The main contributions of this work are illustrated as follows: We consider cyber-attacks prevention for prosumer-basedEVCSs, where prosumers are regarded as the infrastruc-ture for charging EVs. Particularly, cyber-attack detectionvia NT data, and cyber-attack intervention are focused. For cyber-attack detection, to make the boundary betweenbenign and malicious traffic as clear as possible, maxi-mizing the mean distance between samples from benignand malicious traffic is considered. However, this mannerhas a high computational cost if each prosumer hasmany NT data and/or has high dimensional feature space(proved in Section IV-B). Thus, instead, maximizing theoverall detection correctness of all prosumers (ODC) isconsidered, which can achieve lower computational costand is proven in Section IV-C. Afterward, we considerintervention against the detected cyber-attacks. We propose a method named edge-assisted federated pro-totype knowledge distillation (E-FPKD) approach whichis capable of overcoming the non-IID NT data. Beforeutilizing the proposed E-FPKD method, the PearsonCorrelation Coefficient (PCC) is adopted to select featuresover the NT data. Besides, we give each client thefreedom to report their own availability for participatingin FL process. In addition, we introduce KD for eachclient. Motivated by which constructs each clientwith a mentor and a mentee model, we consider eachclient owns a teacher and a student network. Moreover,we introduce prototype aggregation at each round,while we additionally add model aggregation in thefinal round to generate global model. Then a rule-basedmethod called if...then is employed for cyber-attacks intervention. Finally, a comparison experiment is conducted on threedatasets, i.e., NSL-KDD , UNSW-NB15 ,and IoTID20 . Specifically, we compare the proposedmethod with several base methods, e.g., FedProto ,pFedSD , FedAU , and FedExP . Experimen-tal results clarify that the proposed methods effectivenessis notable compared with those baselines. For instance,for IoTID20, in binary classification, the ODC achievedby the proposed method is 1.0810% and 16.10% largerthan that of pFedSD and FedExP, respectively. The remainder of this article is given below. In SectionII, we discuss several related works. In Section III, we showthe notations of this work. In Section IV, the system modelwith associated problem formulation are described. Some basicknowledge regarding the proposed method is given in SectionV. In Section VI, we describe the proposed E-FPKD approach.In Section VII, a comparison experiment is performed. Thelimitations and future potential area are provided in Section",
  "II. RELATED WORK": "As aforementioned, we focus on preventing cyber attacksby detecting and intervening in the attacks on NT data.To devise the solution, we consider employing knowledgedistillation in FL, while adopting the prototype aggregation todeal with the non-IID challenge. In this section, we providethe previous literature on the following aspects: 1) cyber-attackdetection for EV Charging Stations (EVCSs), 2) cyber-attackintervention/prevention, 3) knowledge distillation technique inFL, and 4) prototype aggregation technique.",
  "A. Cyber-attack Detection for EV Charging Station": "Cyber-attack detection for EV charging stations is one ofthe aspects considered by this article. Consequently, we listsome previous studies and illustrate various points consideredby this article. Currently, several studies have been proposedfor the EVCS in terms of cyber-attack detection such as , (summarized in Table I). Specifically, in , a mul-tiple cloud-aided FL-based security module was proposed forcyber attack intrusion detection towards EVCS. Nevertheless,prosumer-based EVCS, KD and prototype aggregation werenot considered by , whereas those points are the focusof this paper. aimed to detect the Distributed Denial ofService (DDoS) attack towards the EVCS network. Differentfrom , we consider binary and multi-class classificationscenarios. In binary classification, we do not distinguish thetypes of attacks; all types of attacks will be regarded asanomalies. In multi-class classification, we consider detectingvarious attacks. Another different point is that the FL-basedapproach was not taken into account by , whereas weconsider that approach in this paper. In , since the riskof cyber-attacks is increasing, multiple ML-based classifieralgorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes classifier, filtered classifier) wereevaluated to detect the malicious traffic of the IoT EVCS.However, prosumer-based EVCS and FL-based approach werenot considered by . In , to detect EVCSs denial ofservice (DOS) attacks, intrusion detection systems based ondeep learning was proposed. However, prosumer-based EVCSand FL-based approach were not taken into account by .",
  "In this article, we consider cyber-attack prevention, and theintervention process is one of the steps for the purpose ofpreventing cyber-attacks. Thus, we provide several previous": "studies regarding cyber-attack intervention or prevention, suchas , , . Moreover, we also illustrate the differencesbetween those studies and our proposed solution. In ,a deep learning-based method was proposed to prevent thenetwork from being attacked by DDoS attacks and insecuredata flows along with similar network intrusions, where apreventive event is triggered at the edge service, e.g., blockingdata transmission. However, does not employ FL, KDand prototype aggregation, which are important techniquesconsidered by this paper. In addition, unlike , we considerpreventing various attacks by multi-class classification in thispaper. In , J48 decision tree algorithm was adopted toextract the patterns that are related to the cyber-attacks via his-torical data, and then a prediction model is built to forecast thefuture cyber-attacks. Afterwards, an expert will take the cyber-attacks intervention to address the cyber-attack. However,identical to , FL, KD and prototype aggregation techniquesdo not utilized by , either. provided vulnerabilityassessment and penetration testing for cyber attack prevention.Different from , we adopt an FL-based deep learningapproach to detect the cyber attacks and then we employ therule-based approach to intervene in the detected cyber-attacks.",
  "C. Knowledge Distillation (KD) Technique in FL": "In this work, KD is one of the techniques that we inte-grate into FL to construct the proposed solution. Thus, inthis subsection, we will describe several previous literatureregarding integrating KD technique in FL including (summarized in Table II). In , a heterogenous FLframework was proposed, where bidirectional KD (i.e., client-to-cloud and cloud-to-client distillation) was utilized to buildeach client model and public dataset for server is needed.In particular, for client-to-cloud distillation, global model istreated as the student network, while each local network areregarded as a teacher network. Thus, the global model willunify the knowledge from each local teacher network. Forcloud-to-client distillation, the global models knowledge willbe distilled for each local network. In , personalized FLbased on self-KD was proposed, where the knowledge ofprevious personal model belongs to a client will be distilledto guide its current local model, and no need to use thepublic dataset. Different from and , we consider eachclient forms by a teacher model and a student model in thisarticle. This is inspired by that adopt a mentor modeland a mentee model to build each client. However, prototypeaggregation was not leveraged by , whereas we integrateKD with prototype aggregation in each round and model",
  "Public dataset is not required. Besides, feature selectionstage and prototype aggregation is considered": "aggregation in the final round. As for , layer-wise KD wasadopted in FL, where a single teacher (server) and multiplestudents (multiple devices) were considered. Besides, considered distilling the knowledge from various layers of theglobal model to teach the local student model. Moreover, needs to use proxy dataset to produce knowledge. Differentfrom , in this paper, proxy dataset is not required, andeach client is constructed by a teacher model and a studentmodel. Besides, we consider distilling the knowledge fromthe teacher model to the student model of the same client.KD-based FL has been leveraged by several studies for vari-ous detection purposes. For instance, have conductedresearch on KD-based FL approach for intrusion detection(ID), while tried to detect energy theft via KD-basedFL method to ameliorate energy management. Particularly, in, dual teacher-student paradigm based FL approach wasproposed for ID, where the knowledge of two teacher modelswill be distilled to guide student model. This structure isdifferent from this article, where we build each client witha teacher and a student model. In , a KD-based semi-supervised FL approach was presented for ID, where unlabeleddata was utilized by distillation approach for enhancing theperformance of classifier. Unlike , we use labeled dataand supervised learning approach. In , FL ensemble KD(FLEKD) approach was proposed for ID, where the server-sidemodel was regarded as student model, while the client modelswere treated as teacher models. Whereas, a client consists ofa teacher and a student model is adopted by this article. In, federated contrastive KD was presented to detect energytheft for an urban area. However, although also consideredbuilding each client by a teacher and a student model, cyber-attack detection is not considered, whereas that is a main pointof this work. Moreover, in , prototype aggregation arenot considered, whereas we adopt it in the proposed solution.",
  "D. Prototype Aggregation (PA) Technique": "In this part, we provide some previous studies that employthe prototype aggregation (PA), which is one of the techniquesused by this work. Besides, we also point out the differencebetween those studies and this article. Several studies haveconsidered using PA to address various problems, e.g., . Specifically, in , PA was adopted to guide the FLframework for human activity recognition. To be more specific, took into account transmitting both the prototypes and therepresentations between server and clients. Unlike , in thispaper, until the penultimate round, we only consider prototypetransferring for the training process. In the final round, notonly prototype transferring, but also model transferring areperformed. In addition to this, we concentrate on cyber attackdetection for prosumer-based charging stations. In , PA was employed in FL for predicting the heterogeneous defect. proposed a multi-branch prototype FL for processing theimage domains in natural and medical, where PA was executedacross each layer of the representation layer. Nevertheless,both and do not consider prosumer-based EVCSs,feature selection and KD. PA was also adopted by , whereprototype per device will be transmitted to the neighbors ofthat device for aggregation. Differ from this, we considersending local prototypes to distribution system operator (DSO)for aggregation.III. NOMENCLATUREIn this section, we illustrate the related notations that areused in this work, which are shown in Table III.IV. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATIONConsidering the prosumer-based EV charging stations(EVCSs) that are composed of a set P = {1, 2, ..., P} ofprosumers, a set S = {1, 2, ..., S} of dedicated local edgeservers (DLESs), a set of charging service required EVs,a distribution system operator (DSO) and the power grid,shown as . In particular, we consider each prosumer hasa smart meter (SM) that is equipped with tamper-detectionand encrypted communication function . Besides, eachprosumer is embedded with a solar panel (SP) along with atleast an EV supply equipment (EVSE), which is regarded asthe physical infrastructure for supplying energy to public EVs.Moreover, each prosumer is considered connecting with theDSO for purchasing power grid energy. Further, we assumeeach prosumer p P is associated with a DLES s S .",
  "JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 20216": "considered EVCSs, which can distinguish the malicious trafficfrom the benign traffic. Generally, the DL model is composedof 1) feature extraction layers (i.e., representation layers ),2) classification decision-making layers (a.k.a. classifier).For each prosumer p P, we assume its connectedDLES owns its NT data. Thus, we deploy the DL modelin each connected DLES s. In addition, we consider a setTp = {1, 2, ..., Tp} of Tp time slots. As a result, the NTdata of prosumer p at all time slots can be denoted as Xs ={x1s, x2s, ..., xts}, xts Rd, t Tp and the corresponding labelscan be represented as Ys = {y1s, y2s, ..., yts}. It is worthwhile tomention that Rd represents the d-dimensional Euclidean space. Let s() and s() denote the representation layers andthe classifier of DL model in the DLES s, respectively. Hence,we can define the extracted features at time slot t, ts, asts = s(xts), which is leveraged as the input of the classifier.For the detected result yts, as per , it can be obtained by,",
  "B. Malicious and Benign Traffic Boundary Model": "To detect the cyber-attacks, it is possible to be achievedby distinguishing the malicious traffic (i.e., anomaly) fromthe benign traffic (i.e., normal). Due to the boundary betweenthose two categories (i.e., inter-class distance ) becomingambiguous, many false detection can occur . Thus, it isstill necessary to be dedicated to distinguish the boundarybetween those two categories (i.e., malicious category andbenign category) as clearly as possible.To facilitate the definition of the boundary between benignand malicious traffic per prosumer p, we define the malicioustraffic set as Xs = {x1s, x2s, ..., xt1s } and the benign traffic setas Xs = {x1s, x2s, ..., xt2s }, where Xs = Xs Xs. According to, the boundary between two categories can be represented asthe mean distance between samples from those two categories(i.e., inter-class distance ). Hence, assuming Xs and Xs arenot empty, the mentioned boundary can be given as follows:",
  "t2=1DIST(t1s , t2s ),(2)": "where DIST(t1s , t2s ) represents the distance between t1sand t2s . Here, t1s and t2s can be obtained by representationlayers. As for | Xs| and | Xs|, they are used to indicate the num-ber of malicious samples and benign samples, respectively.For the boundary distinction between malicious categoryand benign category, as per , it can be realized by maximiz-ing the inter-class distance (maximizing boundarys). However,this method may cost high computational cost, which can beknown through the following Lemma and its proof. Lemma 1: The computational cost of eq. (2) is high, if thereexists many network traffic data per prosumer and/or high-dimensional feature space.Proof: In eq. (2), for the DIST(t1s , t2s ), various meth-ods (L1-distance, L2-distance, etc.) can be chosen for calcu-lation. Consequently, the number of mathematical operationsrelies on the selected method for calculating the distance. For convenience, suppose Edist denotes the number of math-ematical operations for calculating DIST(t1s , t2s ). Thus,according to eq. (2), DIST(t1s , t2s ) needs to be calculated| Xs|| Xs| times. Besides, we also need to compute a multiplica-tion and a division operation for obtaining1 | Xs|| Xs|. Namely,two additional calculations are needed. Accordingly, the totalnumber of operations of eq. (2) is p = | Xs|| Xs|Edist + 2.As a result, if | Xs|, | Xs| and/or Edist are very large, thecomputational cost for eq. (2) will be high.",
  "C. Problem Formulation": "In this work, we concentrate on the cyber-attack preventionissue for the considered prosumer-based EVCSs. Specifically,we consider detecting cyber attacks in NT data first, thenperforming a cyber attack intervention process. The contentsregarding intervention is explained in Section VI. Thus, nextwe will only explain the purpose for cyber-attack detection.According to Lemma 1 with its proof, when each prosumerowns a large amount of NT data and/or high-dimensional fea-ture space, using eq. (2) for malicious and benign traffic datadistinguishment will encounter the computational cost issue.Therefore, reducing the computational cost of distinguishingthe malicious and benign traffic needs to be tackled.To this end, in order to mitigate the computational cost,instead of maximizing eq. (2), we consider maximizing theoverall detection correctness of all prosumers (ODC). It isworth noting that maximizing the ODC has less computationalcost compared with maximizing the eq. (2) for all prosumers.To prove this point, we need to define ODC first. To defineODC clearly, two indicator functions, 1yts=0 and 1yts=1, areintroduced, which are separately given as follows:",
  "1yts=1 = 1, if yts = 1,0, otherwise.(4)": "Here, yts = 0 means the network traffic data at time slott actually is malicious traffic. If the detected result is alsomalicious (i.e., yts = 0), then 1yts=0 is equal to 1. Otherwise,1ytyt s=0 = 0, which means the detected result is wrong. Fors = 1, it represents the network traffic data at time slott is benign traffic in fact. At this situation, if the detectedresult is correct (the detected result is also benign (yts = 1)),then 1yts=1 = 1. Otherwise, 1yts=1 = 0, which indicates thedetected result is malicious traffic.Accordingly, the ODC maximization problem can be de-fined as follows:",
  "t=1(1yts=0 + 1yts=1).(5)": "It is noteworthy that since we consider a prosumer p connectswith a DLES, we have |S| = |P|. Here, |P| means the totalnumber of prosumers in the considered EV charging stations.As for the computational cost of (5), since a traffic data iseither normal or abnormal, the calculation cost of all theprosumers by (5) is |S||Tp| = |S|(| Xs| + | Xs|). Compared",
  "the computational cost of (2) and eq. (5) for all prosumers,we can get the following Lemma with its proof": "Lemma 2: The computational cost of (5) is less than max-imizing eq. (2) for all prosumers under some considerations.Proof: For eq. (2), considering applying it for all pro-sumers, then the computational cost can be obtained as|S|p = |S|(| Xs|| Xs|Edist +2). According to the definition of| Xs|, | Xs| and Edist, since we consider Xs = and Xs = ,it can be known that | Xs| 1, | Xs| 1 and Edist 1. Next,we will illustrate the following cases to prove Lemma 2. Case 1: If | Xs| = 1, | Xs| = 1 and Edist 1, then thecomputational cost of applying eq. (2) can be calculatedas |S|(| Xs|| Xs|Edist + 2) = |S|(Edist + 2). BecauseEdist 1, |S|(Edist + 2) 3|S|. In the case of the com-putational cost of (5), it will be |S|(| Xs| + | Xs|) = 2|S|.Hence, for this case, Lemma 2 can be proved to be true. Case 2: If | Xs| = 1, | Xs| > 1 and Edist 1, thenwe can obtain |S|(| Xs|| Xs|Edist + 2) = |S|(| Xs|Edist +2) |S|(| Xs|+2). The computational cost of (5) can becomputed as |S|(| Xs|+| Xs|) = |S|(| Xs|+1). Thus, in thiscase, we can know |S|(| Xs|| Xs|Edist + 2) > |S|(| Xs| +| Xs|). Accordingly, for this case, Lemma 2 is true. Case 3: If | Xs| > 1, | Xs| = 1 and Edist 1,then |S|(| Xs|| Xs|Edist + 2) = |S|(| Xs|Edist + 2) |S|(| Xs|+2), and |S|(| Xs|+| Xs|) = |S|(| Xs|+1). Thus,|S|(| Xs|| Xs|Edist+2) > |S|(| Xs|+| Xs|), thereby, Lemma2 is correct for this case. Case 4: If | Xs| | Xs| > 1, and Edist 1, then|S|(| Xs|| Xs|Edist + 2) > |S|| Xs|| Xs|Edist. In addition,in this article, | Xs| is adopted to represent the numberof the samples that belong to the benign traffic. Thus,it is integer. Accordingly, since | Xs| > 1, it can beinferred that | Xs| 2. Therefore, it can be obtainedthat |S|| Xs|| Xs|Edist 2|S|| Xs|. For the computationalcost of (5), because | Xs| | Xs|, |S|(| Xs| + | Xs|) |S|(| Xs| + Xs|) = 2|S|| Xs|. Accordingly, we can obtainthat |S|(| Xs|| Xs|Edist + 2) > |S|(| Xs| + | Xs|). Conse-quently, for this case, Lemma 2 is also true. Case 5: If | Xs| | Xs| > 1, and Edist 1, since | Xs|denotes the number of malicious traffic samples, we caninfer | Xs| 2. Hence, similar as Case 4, we can provethat |S|(| Xs|| Xs|Edist+2) > |S|| Xs|| Xs|Edist 2|S|| Xs|and |S|(| Xs|+| Xs|) |S|(| Xs|+ Xs|) = 2|S|| Xs|. Thus,we can prove Lemma 2 is correct in this case.According to the analysis from Case 1 to Case 5, we can proveunder some considerations, Lemma 2 is correct.",
  "V. PRELIMINARIES KNOWLEDGE": "To prevent the considered prosumer-based EVCSs fromsuffering cyber-attacks, we propose an edge-assisted federatedprototype knowledge distillation (E-FPKD) approach. Be-fore explaining the proposed E-FPKD, as federated learning,knowledge distillation, and prototype aggregation are used todesign the proposed solution, for ease of understanding, it isworth to explain those three techniques first before going intothe depth of the proposed solution in Section VI.",
  "The proposed E-FPKD is a FL-based approach. To under-stand the structure of the proposed solution more easily, wewill illustrate the background knowledge of FL in this part": "In edge computing, an emerging approach named FL iswidely used, which is composed of a server and several clients. FL aims to collaboratively train machine learning modelsamong various clients without the necessity of lettingthe data leave their local side. When it comes to FL, it isworth mentioning that a commonly utilized approach is termedFederatedAveraging (i.e., FedAvg) proposed by .As shown in , the procedure of FedAvg consists of 4steps, which will be iterated as per .

In the beginning, the server will send the global modelto each organization to initialize each local model. Then eachorganization will train the local model via its local networktraffic (NT) data such that to update the local model. Next,the updated local model will be transmitted to the server formodel aggregation to generate a new global model.",
  "B. Background: Knowledge Distillation (KD)": "Considering the NT data of each prosumer may be hetero-geneous, since integrating KD into FL is an efficient way forhandling the data heterogeneity issue , KD technique isintroduced to be a composition of the proposed approach. Tomake it easier to understand the proposed method, we providesome background knowledge of KD in this part.KD is the approach that can benefit the training processof the smaller student network (SNet) from the supervisionof a larger teacher network (TNet) . Specifically, theknowledge of TNet will be distilled to SNet. To do this,Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be employed to enablethe SNet to imitate the behavior of the TNet .

  "C. Background: Prototype Aggregation (PA)": "Prototype aggregation (PA) mechanism is another techniquethat we will integrate into FL to construct the proposed method(Section VI). Thus, for ease of understandability towards theproposed solution, it is valuable to illustrate PA beforehand. Prototype is defined as the average value of the embeddingvectors for the instances in class k , where the embeddingvectors are the extracted features from the representationlayers. Notably, according to , one prototype is used toindicate one class.

OVERALL ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN FOR THEPROPOSED METHODOLOGY": "Based on the background knowledge illustrated in the previ-ous section, we design the method for cyber-attack preventiontowards the considered prosumer-based EVCSs. shows the structure of the proposed solution, whichwill be illustrated next. Firstly, feature selection (FS) processfor network traffic (NT) data preprocessing is employed sinceFS is beneficial for increasing accuracy . Secondly, con-sidering the privacy issue per prosumer and the heterogeneousdata distribution among each prosumer, an edge-assisted fed-erated prototype knowledge distillation (E-FPKD) approachis proposed for cyber-attacks prevention, where this methodis designed based on the incorporation of federated learning,knowledge distillation (KD), prototype aggregation and rule-based method . Particularly, we deploy the DL-based CDMon each DLES (dedicated local edge server) and treat eachDLES as an E-FPKD client. To be more specific, the proposedE-FPKD approach contains two parts: cyber-attacks detectionby solving eq. (5), and cyber-attacks intervention. To detect",
  ": Overall architecture of the proposed E-FPKD approach towards cyber-attacks prevention in both detection and intervention": "cyber-attacks, we combine KD and prototype aggregation withthe FL approach. Besides, in practice, it is unrealistic tosuppose all clients are always able to offer the training service, which may cause some clients to be unwilling to join thetraining process. Thus, each clients availability is adopted inthis article. Accordingly, as shown in , we introduce thelocal client by the following order: 1) the availability of eachclient for joining the FL process, 2) how to use KD to constructthe local client (teacher network and student network), 3) theprototypes gained by each local SNet, and 4) the objectiveof each local SNet. As for the DSO cloud, availability-basedaggregation process for cyber-attacks detection is conducted,which contains 1) prototype aggregation in each round, 2)model aggregation in the final round for future application,and 3) the global objective. After detection, the detectedcyber attacks will be intervened at each edge via the rule-based method. It is noteworthy that the proposed solution isadvantageous in handling NT data with non-IID nature and canprotect privacy to a certain extent. The reasons are as follows: The proposed E-FPKD approach is constructed based onthe FL. For FL, it can ensure data privacy by saving dataand training the model on each client locally . Thus,the proposed E-FPKD approach can also assure the dataprivacy issue caused by central data collection. However, FL faces the challenge of handling non-IID data. Since applying KD in FL can help deal with thedata heterogeneity issue , we introduce KD into FLto build the proposed E-FPKD approach. Motivated by that considers each client to consist of a menteemodel and a mentor model, we employ a teacher modeland a student model to form each client. Hence, eachclient will have its own teacher model, which can betteradapt to the local datasets characteristics. Apart from KD, prototype aggregation proposed by is also employed to create the proposed E-FPKD ap-proach. Prototype aggregation has the following goodnessgiven by : 1) through prototype aggregation, theidentical label space can enable the embedding space of the participating client to be shared, 2) the information iscapable of exchanging efficiently across all the participat-ing heterogeneous clients, and 3) the heterogeneous classspaces can be supported. Hence, integrating prototypeaggregation can further help process non-IID data.The sub-sections VI-A VI-G are organized byA G shown in , while sub-section VI-H summarizes theproposed E-FPKD algorithm towards cyber-attack prevention. shows the overall architecture of the proposed E-FPKDapproach.

  "A. Feature Selection for NT Data Preprocessing": "Feature selection is a critical step for optimizing learningcomplexity through prioritizing the features, especially forthe network traffic data . Through the feature selectionprocess, the irrelevant features can be excluded .In this article, Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) is em-ployed for feature selection. Particularly, PCC was introducedin 1895 by Pearson , which adopts bivariate analysis that is capable of evaluating the strength of the relationshipbetween two vectors . Let T= {1, 2, ..., T} denoteall time slots of network traffic (NT) data. As described inSection IV-A, we consider the NT data of each time slott belongs to Rd (d-dimensional Euclidean space), withoutloss of generality, we denote the NT data at time slot t asxt = {xt1, xt2, ..., xtd}, t T . Then the NT data of all timeslots can be denoted as X = {x1, x2, ..., xt}. For two featuresof X, i and j, the vector of feature i can be represented asxi = {x1i, x2i, ..., xti}, while the vector of feature j can bedenoted as xj = {x1j, x2j, ..., xtj}, t T .

As a result, we consider 0.1 PCC 1or 1 PCC 0.1 as the rule for choosing features.Algorithm 1 lists the process of the feature selection processvia PCC. Specifically, in line 1, we generate each featurevector of the network traffic data. Then using eq. (9), the PCCof each two features will be computed (line 2). In line 3, wecheck whether the calculated PCCs satisfy the condition. It isnoteworthy that instead of finding the minimum feature set forCDM model generation in this article, to reduce the complex-ity, we only focus on the effectiveness of the feature selectionwith the PCC approach for the proposed E-FPKD approach.Thus, the following rule is introduced heuristically (line 4):1) obtain and sort the No. of PCC in [1, 0.1] [0.1, 1] perfeature, 2) retain the features corresponding to the top fewnumbers empirically. Next, the NT data of a client after thefeature selection process will be obtained (line 5). Finally, wecan get NT data after feature selection in line 6.Notably, NT data handled by PCC will be used as the inputof the proposed E-FPKD approach that will be illustrated next.",

  ": KD applied to per client in the proposed E-FPKD approach": "In , we demonstrate the KD applied to each client (i.e.,DLES s) in the proposed E-FPKD approach, which is a partof . To be specific, each client has two network: teachernetwork (TNet) and student network (SNet). TNet is used togenerate the teacher model, while SNet is utilized to producethe student model. In addition, the network traffic data afterfeature selection process will be used as the input of both TNetand SNet. For TNet and SNet, we adopt deep learning to createthem. Thus, they both contain the representation layers andclassifier 1. For the sake of simplicity, we use the combinationof one-dimensional (1D) convolutional neural network (CNN)and fully connected (FC) network to build the representationlayers of TNet and SNet, as shown in . It is noteworthythat the reason for utilizing 1D-CNN is that we representa network traffic record by a vector. For the classifier, wesimply adopt an FC layer. The idea of KD can be the idea ofleveraging the TNets soft probabilities to supervise the SNet, where the soft probabilities can be calculated via Softmaxwith Temperature scaling (softmax T). Accordingly, weconsider using softmax T to convert the output of the classifierinto soft probability in this work. Then the soft probability ofTNet and SNet will be used to determine the KD loss.Given the network traffic data at time slot t, xts, theoutput of TNet per client s can be denoted as bs(xts) =[b1s(xts), b2s(xts), ..., bks(xts)].

Before definingthe local loss function of this work, it is valuable to mentionthat multiple types of cyberattacks may exist in the real world.Thus, without loss of generality, we consider both binaryand multi-class classification in this work.

The problemis that with prototype aggregation, each client will have itsown personal model. Thus, if a new client joins the process,even though the global prototypes can be downloaded fromthe DSO cloud, it requires the newly joined client to dothe fine-tuning process by adjusting its local prototypes tomatch the downloaded global prototypes as much as possible.To tackle this problem, to be simplified, firstly, we assumeeach participating client agrees with using the same structure.Secondly, we consider using the prototype aggregation fortraining in all rounds, and then, different from , weintroduce model aggregation in the final round to generate theglobal model.

Based on the detection results, the rule-based methodwill be performed to block the malicious NT data in line 4. Remark 1: Trade-off between Security and ComputationalEfficiency.The proposed E-FPKD approach is designedbased on FL. It is possible to support EVCSs with large-scaleprosumers. When the No. of prosumers increases, we merelyneed to raise the No. of the clients in the proposed method.Like FL, accessing the local data owned by each client is notrequired by the server. Thus, compared with centralized man-ner, the data privacy issue caused by centrally gathering datacan be protected to a certain extent. Hence, for an environmentwith high data privacy requirements, the proposed method canbe preferred over centralized methods. As for the independentmethod (training model individually), the average performanceacross all the clients may be degraded, compared with theproposed method. Because of the existence of the data non-IIDissue, some clients may not have abundant data. This can affectthe overall performance, because insufficient data can hinderthe performance as per . Thus, there is a trade-off betweenthe proposed method and the independent methods. Regardingthe proposed method, the additional computational overheadmay happen at each client during teacher model (TM) pre-training phase. However, this only occurs in the beginning.Because we do not need to train TM every round, thereby,the computation overhead of the proposed method can be stillsmaller than the one with training TM every round.In addition, we introduce prototype aggregation (PA) in eachround, while only in the final round, both PA and modelaggregation (MA) are used. Owing to this manner, the riskof inferring original input data may be reduced, comparedwith using MA in each round. Because the input data is ableto be inferred through the given model . As for eachprototype, it is an average value of the embedding vectorsand a prototype corresponds to a class, which can increasethe difficulty of reasoning the data structure (e.g., data vectorlength). Accordingly, since we only adopt MA in the finalround, we can infer that the data leakage risk of the proposed",

Moreover,since KD and prototype aggregation are beneficial for non-IID data processing, the proposed method is advantageous inprocessing heterogeneous data. As a result, considering thesecurity issue (data leakage) and the potential of handling non-IID data, it is reasonable to employ the proposed method forcyber-attack prevention. Time Complexity (TC).The proposed E-FPKD approachis an FL-based approach composed of a server (i.e., DSOcloud) and multiple clients, where each client consists ofTNet and SNet. In particular, TNet is pre-trained and SNetis used for training. We adopt the combination of CNN andfully connected (FC) network to form each TNet and SNet.For TNet, same as , we calculate its time complexity bysumming up the time complexity of CNN and FC networks.Specifically, the TC of a convolutional layer of TNet can begiven as: OGneGnfGks(Gts Gks +1), where Gne, Gnf,Gks and Gts denote the number of elements of the input vector,the number of CNN filters, kernel size and the number oftime steps (time slots in this work) .

  "A. Experimental Setup": "1) Model Setup: In this article, we consider the teachernetwork consists of three 1D-convolutional layers with twofully connected (FC) layers. Particularly, the number of chan-nels for the input of the convolutional layers is separately 1,512 and 1024, while the number of channels generated bythe convolutional layers are 512, 1024, and 2048, respectively.Each convolutional layer is considered to connect with a BatchNormalization and a ReLU activation function. As for the firstFC layer, the input unit is the features number for a record 2048, and the output unit is 512. For the second FC layer, theinput unit is 512, while the output unit is the number of classes.In the case of the student model, we consider it owns two 1D-convolutional layers and two FC layers. Specifically, regardingthe convolutional layers, the number of input channels for each",

Besides, the input for the first FC layer is thenumber of features for a record 128, and the correspondingoutput unit is 64. The second FC layers input unit is 64 andthe output unit is the number of classes. In addition, in regardto the optimizers, we adopt Adam for the teacher network andSGD for the student network. Additionally, identical to which considers randomly initializing the weight of the deepneural network (DNN)-based network at the first iteration, weconsider initializing the weights of TNet and SNet randomlyin the beginning round. Moreover, regarding the availabilityof the clients, inspired by which considers randomlyselecting EV charging stations to join the FL process in eachround, we also adopt the stochastic selection for determiningthe availability of the clients (i.e., DLESs of prosumers) ineach round. The settings of the parameters are summarizedin Table IV. Notably, for datasets, we adopt NSL-KDD ,UNSW-NB15 , and IoTID20 dataset (describein Section VII-A3). The features number for a record dependson the dataset, which will be illustrated in Section VII-A4.2) Baselines: To evaluate the effectiveness of the pro-posed method, we compare it with the following bench-marks: 1) the E-FPKD approach without featureselection (FS), where we remove FS but keep otherparts same as the proposed E-FPKD method. 2) TheE-FPKD approach without learning rate (LR)decay, where we discard the LR decay (0.97 ) per roundbut embrace other parts of the proposed method. Particularly,we adopt LR = LR 0.97q1 to calculate LR in qth round. 3) The E-FPKD approach with DNN-basedrepresentation layers, where DNN is used to createthe representation layers. In particular, for handling the NSL-KDD dataset, the network per client contains two FC layers asrepresentation layers, and one FC layer as classifier. The inputunits for each FC layer are separately the number of featuresfor a record, 128 and 64, while the output units for each FClayer are 128, 64 and No. of classes, respectively. To addressthe UNSW-NB15 and IoTID20 datasets, we consider usingtwo FC layers, where one layer is regarded as representationlayer, and the other is treated as classifer. The input units foreach layer are the number of features for a record and 32,respectively. The output units per layer are separately 32 andNo. of classes. 4) Independent CNN, where we apply CNNfor each client independently (the CNN is the same as the SNetadopted by the proposed method); 5) Independent KD,where KD technique is leveraged for each client independently(the KD is identical to the proposed method; 6) FedKD:where we retain the KD part of the proposed method anduse mode aggregation in each round. 7) some other FL-basedframework: FedAvg , FedProx , FedProto ,pFedSD , FedAU , FedExP , FedGKD .For these methods, we embrace the student network of theproposed method to form each client. Next, we will discussthe limitations of baseline methods and how to deal withthem with the proposed E-FPKD approach.In regard to E-FPKD without feature selection (FS) method,lack of FS may result in irrelevant features in the input data.Large irrelevant features will cause serious issues for the existing machine-learning approaches . Thus, since FS iscapable of excluding irrelevant features , we adopt FS inthis work. With respect to the method of E-FPKD withoutlearning rate (LR) decay, the LR of the network will continueto be fixed. According to , if LR is too small, the modeltraining process will converge slowly; if LR is too large, themodel performance will degrade. Hence, to solve this issue,same as , we adopt LR decay in this work, which willmake the LR vary each round. When it comes to the method ofE-FPKD with DNN-based representation layers (RLs), DNNis used as the RLs. For this manner, huge amount of data maybe required for training. This is because to achieve the targetaccuracy, DNN needs to use large input data to train the model. However, some prosumers may lack data, thus, in sucha situation, it will become inappropriate to use DNN. As per, adding the convolutional layer can increase the networknonlinearity, which can help increase the accuracy. Therefore,instead of DNN, we employ the convolutional layers in thiswork. In the case of FedKD, FedAvg , FedProx ,pFedSD , FedAU , FedExP and FedGKD ,all of these methods utilize model aggregation method. Withmodel aggregation, as the input data is capable of beinginferred through a given model , the input data inferenceproblem needs to be focused. For FedProto , despiteFedProto leverages prototype aggregation rather than modelaggregation, when a new client joins, fine-tuning processis required . To balance the model inference and fine-tuning issues, in the proposed method, we conduct prototypeaggregation in each round, and model aggregation in the finalround to generate the global model for future use.3) Datasets Description: To verify the goodness of theproposed approach, we use three datasets including NSL-KDD dataset (i.e., KDDTrain+.csv and KDDTest+.csv),UNSW-NB15dataset(UNSW NB15 training-set.csv and UNSW NB15 testing-set.csv is adopted), andIoTID20 dataset .NSL-KDD dataset KDDTrain+.csv is employedfor global model generation and KDDTest+.csv is used inapplication stage. This dataset is a new version of the KDDdataset that is composed of the chosen records from thefull KDD dataset . As described in , for the NSL-KDD dataset, it contains 43 features, where 41 features arethe input traffic features and the other two features are thelabel of the category (i.e., normal or attack) and the scoreused to indicate the severity of the attack. For simplicity, thescore feature is abandoned in this article. In addition, thisdataset is labeled under normal and four categories, viz.,DoS, probe, U2R and R2L. It is worth noting that theNSL-KDD dataset has several advantages. As per , thoseadvantages are given below: 1) in the training dataset, there areno redundant records, 2) for the test dataset, it does not containduplicate records, 3) in both the training and test datasets,the number of records is reasonable (i.e., KDDTest+.csv has22544 records, while KDDTrain+.csv has 125973 records).As aforementioned, we consider both binary and multi-classclassification. Thus, in binary classification, we regard DoS,probe, U2R, and R2L as anomaly class, and normal asnormal class. In multi-class classification, we consider five",

In particular, UNSW NB15 training-set.csvisutilizedforproducingtheglobalmodel,whileUNSW NB15 testing-set.csvisadoptedforapplication stage. For these two files, there are 175, 341and82, 332recordsfortrainingpartandtestingpart,respectively.Inthecaseofthelabelsfortwofiles,10labelsareincluded,namely,Analysis,Backdoor, DoS, Exploits, Fuzzers, Generic,Reconnaissance, Shellcode, Worms,andNormal. Thus, in binary classification, the record withthe labels of Analysis, Backdoor, DoS, Exploits, Fuzzers,Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode, and Worms are treated asanomaly category, while the records with Normal label areregarded as normal category. In multi-class classification,we consider these 10 labels as 10 categories for detection.IoTID20 dataset IoTID20 dataset was proposedby , which contains a huge number of the general net-work features as well as flow-based features . For thisdataset, it is produced from a real-time scenario by IoTdevice and can be used for detecting the anomalousactivity in the IoT networks . Besides, it contains 86columns and 625, 783 records (i.e., rows) . Consideringthis dataset contains duplicate records, same as , weconsider removing those duplicate records. Consequently, only461, 696 records are left. In addition, for IoTID20, thereexists several infinite values . It can be known from that we can remove those infinite values. Hence, forsimplicity, the records with infinite value are discarded inthis paper. Additionally, some features in IoTID20 datasetbelong to nominal type, which are highly regarding thetestbeds network configuration . Those features include {Flow ID, Src IP, Dst IP, Timestamp} . As men-tioned in , those features can be discarded. Thus, we getrid of those features for convenience. For global model gener-ation and testing in the application phase, we consider usingaround 70% and 30% data, respectively. In IoTID20 dataset,3 features that are related to label are provided, where thosefeatures are named Label, Cat, and Sub Cat, respectively. Tobe specific, the Label feature is composed of {Anomaly,Normal} these two classes, while the Cat feature con-sists of {DoS, Mirai, MITM ARP Spoofing (MAS),Scan, Normal} these five classes. As for the Sub Catfeature, it consists of more classes. Thus, to be convenient,the Label feature is used for binary classification in this work,while the Cat feature is leveraged for multi-class classification. 4) Data Preprocessing via Feature Selection (FS): Theoriginal NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets have trainingand test parts. For simplicity, we perform FS process withPearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) for the training partof NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. For IoTID20, FS processis executed for the whole dataset. As mentioned in SectionVI-A, we consider PCC in the range of [1, 0.1] [0.1, 1]for feature selection. From to , we list the numberof PCC values for each feature versus other features with 0.1 PCC 1 or 1 PCC 0.1. Notably, the Label featureis excluded. Since we only focus on the effectiveness of thefeature selection with the PCC approach for the proposed E-FPKD method rather than finding the minimum feature set,for simplicity, we retain the features with the larger numberof PCC values in the range of [1, 0.1][0.1, 1]. Empirically,we select the top 22 features with the largest number ofPCC values that meet the conditions for NSL-KDD dataset.Similarly, the top 27 features of UNSW-NB15 dataset areselected, while the top 40 features of IoTID20 dataset arechosen. The name of those selected features can be foundin , and , respectively.",

To this end, for the sake ofexploring the robustness of the proposed method, to tail thedataset for each client with heterogeneous characteristics, theDirichlet Distribution with parameter = 0.5 , = 0.9 and = 5 are employed. In addition, to further exhibit thegoodness, various levels of clients are taken into consideration.To be specific, we consider 10, 20, and 50 clients, respectively.As mentioned in Section VI-E, there may be sorts of cyberattacks in the real-world. Consequently, for the consideredprosumer-based EV charging stations, to achieve the purposeof cyber attacks prevention, we consider both binary and multi-class classification. As a result, in this section, those twotypes of classification are taken into account for evaluatingthe potential advantage of the proposed method. In termsof the binary classification, we only consider two classes:{anomaly, normal}, while the classes in multi-class classifi- cation will be varied according to the dataset being used in thiswork. It is noteworthy that in Section IV, we consider the ODCis calculated based on two categories: the malicious trafficand benign traffic. Hence, although multi-class classificationis considered, when computing the ODC, various detectedanomaly classes will be counted as the category of malicioustraffic, while normal traffic belongs to the category of benigntraffic. As for the condition towards the considered prosumer-based EVCSs, in order to avoid the fine-tuning process of eachnewly joined client, as mentioned before, we assume thoseclients are not against using the same model structure.",

Therefore, we adopt accuracy,precision, recall, F1 score, and FAR as QPMs to analyzethe efficiency of the proposed method towards cyber-attackdetection. Moreover, based on the first four metrics, we ad-ditionally define average accuracy (AA), average precision(AP), average recall (AR), and average F1 Score (AFS) forquantitative analysis.

To obtainthose metrics, there are four terms that need to be known.Identical to , , we present those four terms as below:1) True Positive (TP) means correctly detected as attacks(actual is attack traffic), 2) True Negative (TN) indicatescorrectly detected as normal traffic (actual is normal traffic), 3)False Positive (FP) represents the normal traffic is incorrectlydetected as attacks, and 4) False Negative (FN) denotes theattack traffic is incorrectly detected as the normal traffic.

Thus, inthis part, we will conduct efficiency comparisons between theproposed method and baselines via considered QPMs.Various Scenarios.In Table VI, we perform the proposedE-FPKD approach on three datasets for binary and multi-class classification, where we choose different parameter forDirichlet Distribution (i.e., = {0.5, 0.9, 5}). It is noted thatthe smaller means higher data heterogeneity . ThroughTable VI, it can be observed that for binary classification overthe considered three datasets, the higher the data heterogeneity(i.e., smaller ), the higher the accuracy achieved by theproposed method. However, when it comes to multi-classclassification, it can be seem that for both UNSW-NB15 and IoTID20 datasets, the accuracy increases as decreases. Whereas, concerning the NSL-KDD dataset ,when changes from 5 to 0.9, the accuracy rises, but whenit drifts from 0.9 to 0.5, the accuracy declines. Thus, wecan conjecture that the proposed method can be adapted toNon-IID data environment within a certain range. For theconvenience of evaluating the proposed method, we select = 0.9 in the following.Scalability.Similar to which evaluates the scalabil-",

Through TableVII, it can be known that when the number of clients is onan upward trend, the accuracy is on a downward trend. Thereasons for this phenomenon are speculated as follows: 1) thetotal data quantity of those three datasets is fixed regardless ofthe number of clients, 2) additionally, for each round, it maybe not all clients are willing to participate in model generationprocess. As observed in Table VII, the proposed approach cansupport varying scale of clients in both binary and multi-classclassification.

In terms of multi-classification, for both NSL-KDD and IoTID20 datasets, it canbe seen that the proposed method can acquire higher accuracy.As for the UNSW-NB15 dataset, when leveraging DNN as therepresentation layer, the achieved accuracy is very low, therebywe omit to mark the corresponding value in the Table. Thisphenomenon occurs because the convolutional layer is adoptedby the proposed method, which can increase the networknonlinearity such that the accuracy can be increased .To reduce the occupied space in this work, and for conve-nience, we show the confusion matrix (CM) for binary clas-sification by using the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasetsonly (as shown in ), while we show CM for multi-class classification with IoTID20 dataset (shown as ).According to and Section VII-B1, we derive TableIX. From this Table, compared with FedProx and FedKD, forNSL-KDD dataset, it can be seen that the accuracy, precision,recall, F1 score and AA achieved by the proposed methodare the highest, while the achieved FAR is the lowest.

The reasons for such phenomenon are asfollows: 1) compared with FedProx, FedKD and pFedSD, onlythe proposed E-FPKD approach adds the regularization term(eq. (14)) to each local loss function. As stated in , the",

Integrating KD into FL is an effectivemanner to handle data heterogeneity . Thus, owing to KD,the performance of the proposed method in handling non-IIDdata is improved. Accordingly, we can infer that the proposedmethod is an effective way to detect cyber-attacks. Next, we compare our proposed method with IndependentCNN (ICNN) and Independent KD (IKD) approach regardingaverage accuracy, average precision, average recall, and aver-age F1 score by using NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets,as shown in .

The reasons forobtaining those results are that: 1) compared with FedProto,we additionally integrate KD, where as mentioned previously,adding KD to FL is helpful for handling the non-IID data.2) In contrast with other methods, a regularization term isadded to the proposed approach, which can help to learn abetter representation net. Consequently, the proposed methodcan gain the highest accuracy.Robustness of the Proposed Method.To evaluate therobustness of the proposed method, same as , we alsoconsider demonstrating the achieved accuracy across differentrounds (as shown in Table XI). In this Table, compared withFedAvg and pFedSD, for NSL-KDD and IoTID20 datasets,the accuracy obtained by the proposed method is the best inboth binary and multi-class classification at various rounds. Asfor UNSW-NB15 dataset, the proposed method can realize themaximum accuracy in binary classification. In multi-class clas-sification, in comparison with FedAvg, the achieved accuracyvia the proposed method is higher. However, compared withpFedSD, the accuracy obtained via the proposed approach islower when considering 5 rounds. This is because the modeltraining is still in the exploration stage in the initial rounds,it is possible to get lower accuracy via the proposed methodthan that obtained by pFedSD for multi-class classificationof the UNSW-NB15 dataset. This trend is changed when theround is increased to 10, 20 and 50. Hence, overall, it canbe conjectured that the robustness of the proposed method issignificant to some extent, compared to FedAvg and pFedSD.In Table XII, we clarify the ODC (eq.

  "Need server buffer to save historical global modelsNoNoNoYesNo": "and the highest accuracy (as shown in Section VII-B2), it canbe inferred that the performance of the proposed method inaddressing the non-IID NT data of this work is the best amongthose methods. In addition, all of them can solve the dataprivacy issue caused by centralized gathering, since centralizeddata collection is not required. Considering the input data canbe deduced through the given model , data leakage istaken into account. Among the considered methods, only Fed-Proto and the proposed method can reduce data leakage riskcaused by model inverse inference. This is because prototypeaggregation is employed in each round for FedProto, whilemodel aggregation (MA) is only adopted in the final roundfor the proposed method. Through such a manner, the modelinverse inference can be mitigated. Apart from this, for futureapplication, when a new client joins, only FedProto requiresnew client to conduct a fine-tuning process. The reason isthat MA is adopted by FedAvg, pFedSD, and FedGKD ineach round, and employed by the proposed method in thefinal round. Thereby, the final generated global model can bedirectly used by the newly joined client without the need offine-tuning. As for FedProto, it generates global prototypeswhich can not be directly used as a model. Further, onlyFedGKD requires the server buffer to save historical globalmodels. Because FedGKD needs to save several historicalglobal models for generating the ensemble model. 2) Qualitative analysis by analyzing Computing ResourceUsage: In this part, we will compare the computing resourceusage of the proposed method with FedAvg, pFedSD, Fed-Proto, and FedGKD. In particular, we compare the server andeach client of the proposed method with those baselines interms of computing resource usage. Notably, after detectingthe cyber-attacks with each method, we simply adopt a basicrule-based method to directly block the malicious networktraffic. Thus, for simplicity, we only consider the computingresource utilization for cyber-attack detection. Specifically,compared with FedAvg and FedProto, for each client, pre-training TNet is required by the proposed method, whichcauses the proposed method to consume additional comput-ing resources. During the clients student network training,FedProto needs to compute the regularization term and thelocal prototypes, but the client of FedAvg does not need to.In contrast to FedProto, the proposed method also needs tocalculate the KD loss. Accordingly, the client of proposedmethod requires the most computational resources comparedwith FedAvg and FedProto. Regarding the server, modelaggregation (MA) is adopted by FedAvg in each round, whileprototype aggregation (PA) is employed by FedProto. When itcomes to the proposed method, the PA is performed in eachround, and the MA is only executed in the final round. Hence,we can infer the computing resource usage of the server of the proposed method is in the middle of FedAvg and FedProto.As for FedGKD and pFedSD, compared with FedAvg, thosemethods need to additionally compute the KD loss. In additionto KD loss, as the proposed method also needs to calculatethe prototype in each client, the client computation resourceutilization of the proposed method is higher than FedGKDsclient and pFedSDs client. Moreover, both FedGKD andpFedSD adopt model aggregation in each round. For FedGKD,it is necessary to calculate the ensemble model by using severalmodels. As such, among FedGKD, pFedSD and the proposedmethod, the server computing resource usage of the proposedmethod is the smallest, and that of FedGKD is the largest.Accordingly, the order of servers computing resource usageis: FedGKD > pFedSD = FedAvg > E-FPKD (Ours) >FedProto. Considering the purpose of this work is to maximizethe ODC (5), for the proposed method, although the computingresources separately used by each client and the server are notthe smallest, its efficiency (as shown in Section VII-B2) is thebest in achieving (5). Therefore, it is feasible to adopt theproposed E-FPKD for cyber-attack detection.",
  "VIII. DISCUSSION": "Limitations.In this work, although the ODC achievedby the proposed solution is competitive compared to otherbaselines (e.g., FedProto), the proposed solution still hastwo limitations. Concretely, supervised learning is adoptedto construct the proposed E-FPKD approach. Owing to this,to generate the model, labeled data are required. In such away, unknown patterns will fail to be recognized . Inaddition, in the final round, model aggregation is adopted togenerate the global model. According to , with the givenmodel, input data can be inferred. Thus, although the proposedsolution can solve the data privacy issue caused by centralizedgathering data, the risk of data leakage may still occur due tothe potential of model inverse inference in the final round.Future Potential Research Areas.Future potential re-search areas can be conducted based on above two limitations.Specifically, rather than supervised learning, unsupervisedlearning (UL) or semi-supervised learning (SSL)can be leveraged. Thus, combining FL with advanced UL orSSL can be a potential research direction. To mitigate the dataleakage issue, model protecting technique can be considered.For instance, masks and homomorphic encryption are possibleto be employed since they can prevent data from being inferredby a variety of attacks (e.g., model inversion attack) .",

The purpose is to maximize the ODC. To tacklethis aspect, an edge-assisted federated prototype knowledgedistillation (E-FPKD) approach has been proposed. To improveaccuracy, we have conducted feature selection with PearsonCorrelation Coefficient before using the proposed E-FPKDapproach. In addition, we have considered deploying eachclient model on a dedicated local edge server, where eachclient can launch its availability for participating in the FLprocess. Apart from this, we have integrated the KD techniquefor each client, which allows the student model can learnfrom the teacher model to gain useful information. Besides,we have combined the KD with the prototype aggregation forperformance enhancement. Then, the global model obtained byaveraging all the participating clients personal models in thefinal round is adopted for the application stage such that thenewly joined clients can directly use it without the necessityof fine-tuning. Finally, to intervene in the detected cyber at-tacks, a rule-based method called if...then is employed. Theconducted experiments clarify the practicality of the proposedmethod.

  "TD SGE (Multi-class)0.5856": "Applicability.In this part, we shed light on the applica-bility of the proposed E-FPKD approach. As stated before, 1D-CNN combined with FC network, and supervised learning areused to construct the proposed method. Thus, the applicationrange of the proposed method can be: since 1D-CNN isutilized to receive the input data, if the data is labeled dataand each data record can be denoted as a vector, the proposedmethod can be leveraged. Next, as examples, we apply theproposed approach to two cases in other domains, where thedetailed scenario will be discussed based on each case.Case 1: Smart Grid Stability Analysis.Considering anurban area that consists of multiple regions and a distribu-tion system operator (DSO) for buying power grid energy,particularly, each region is formed by one energy producerand multiple energy consumers. For such an urban area,we aim to analyze its smart grid stability by the proposedapproach. Specifically, each region is considered as the clientof the proposed approach and the aggregation process will beexecuted in the DSO. To perform this, Smart Grid Stability(SGS) dataset is adopted since each record of thatdataset is labeled by stable or unstable, and it contains the information regarding a energy producer and multiple energyconsumers. As SGS dataset only includes two categories (i.e.,{unstable, stable}), only binary classification scenariois considered in this case. Further, we use Dirichlet Distribu-tion with parameter = 0.9 to prepare data for 10 clients.Case 2: Energy Theft Detection.Consider a smart gridenvironment that is composed of multiple energy users anda DSO (same as case 1), we aim to detect the energy thefttowards such an environment with the proposed approach.Specifically, each energy user is considered as each client,and the aggregation process is performed in DSO. For eval-uation, we employ Theft detection in smart grid environmentdataset (TD SGE) which contains energy consumptiondata belonging to normal or six types of thefts. Thus, weconsider both binary (i.e., {Theft, Normal}) and multi-class classification (i.e., {Theft1, Theft2, Theft3,Theft4, Theft5, Theft6, Normal}) scenarios forTD SGE dataset. In addition, we also use Dirichlet Distri-bution with parameter = 0.9 to split data for 10 clients.In Table XIV, we clarify the accuracy achieved by theproposed method for both Case 1 and Case 2.
