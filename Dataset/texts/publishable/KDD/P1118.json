  "Kolkata, India": "ABSTRACT Cloud computing has high applicability as an Internet based service that relies on sharing computing resources. Cloud computing provides services that are Infrastructure based, Platform based and Software based. The popularity of this technology is due to its superb performance, high level of computing ability, low cost of services, scalability, availability and flexibility. The obtainability and openness of data in cloud environment make it vulnerable to the world of cyber-attacks. To detect the attacks Intrusion Detection System is used, that can identify the attacks and ensure information security. Such a coherent and proficient Intrusion Detection System is proposed in this paper to achieve higher certainty levels regarding safety in cloud environment. In this paper, the mating behavior of peafowl is incorporated into an optimization algorithm which in turn is used as a feature selection algorithm. The algorithm is used to reduce the huge size of cloud data so that the IDS can work efficiently on the cloud to detect intrusions. The proposed model has been experimented with NSL-KDD dataset as well as Kyoto dataset and have proved to be a better as well as an efficient IDS.

INTRODUCTION Cloud Computing provides the opportunities of accessing the remote activities which are services like platform, software or infrastructure as per the needs over the Internet. It provides the facilities over the Internet which can be accessed from anywhere the user wishes to use. Since the use of this technology is increasing day by day, the privacy of data has become a matter of concern as it attracts more intruders who try to access data illegally . For privacy, IDS provides us with a solution. IDS performs a crucial role in minimizing threats to the information system and maintaining security in the network . IDSs are of mainly two types: Network based IDS (NIDS) and Host based IDS (HIDS). NIDS is located at critical points of the network to investigate all data packets passing across . It analyses the passing packets on the entire subdivision of the network. In case it notices any malicious activity by matching it with previous attack records, it notifies the host and prevents the attack. It has a strong mechanism but with very low visibility in the host server. HIDS is placed on individual hosts. It holds a record of important system files and keeps on checking each incoming and outgoing file. In case any alterations in the records are found, it notifies the administrator. HIDS is not capable of monitoring applications, only the use of resources of the applications can be checked by it. Depending on the finding mechanism of IDS, it can be categorized into misuse detection and anomaly detection . Only the attacks for which a previous record is already present can be",
  ". Flowchart of the proposed model": "3.1. Behavior of Peafowls By the term Peafowl, both peacock and peahen are addressed. Peacocks elaborate their colorful feathers to attract the peahens. In the mating season, the peacocks spread their feathers to show the dominance and to prove themselves superior compared to the others. The prettier the peacock, the more peahens are attracted by it. A peacock shakes his feathers and struts around with confidence as if he owns the place. Tail feathers of a peacock can be seen underneath the feathers which are spread to attract peahens. Peacocks have also a wide vocabulary of calls, and during the mating season they make a distinctive hoot to attract the peahens. The peahens are attracted by the colorfulness as well as the intensity of the sound or mating call generated by the peacocks. The peahens roam around the territories, after that, they select the peacock to mate with. The peacocks with the higher colorfulness and sound intensity are likely to be chosen by the peahens with higher efficiency. Peacocks are polygamous by nature i.e., they wish to mate with as many peahens as possible. There are some peacocks who are more attractive as well as stronger than others and are likely to mate with multiple peahens in a single season. These types of peacocks are called dominant ones. So, they are basically more efficient creatures in their own kingdom. The Peacocks which are not so efficient are called non-dominant peacocks. Those are less likely to mate with more than one peahen. After mating, peahens leave the place with the fertilized eggs to lay. In this way the generation continues.",
  "In every generation the total number of peafowls are constant": "The algorithm is basically based on two key characteristics of peafowl: the intensity of mating call of the peacock and the colorfulness of their feathers. The attractiveness (Ai) of a peafowl i, depends on the intensity of mating call I0, the colorfulness of the feathers C0 and the distance dij between peafowl i and j. Ai varies with the change in dij. As the medium is interpreted as consistent, attractiveness varies monotonically and exponentially. The attractiveness is described as",
  "(1)": "where, 1 and 2 are sound wave distortion coefficient and color absorption coefficient respectively. Values for 1 and 2 are given as 1, 2 [0, +). The value of dij for two peafowls i and j is basically the Euclidean distance between co-ordinates xi and xj which can be given as",
  "(2)": "In this proposed PFM algorithm, the authors have taken n data points as N (set of n number of data points or peafowls) randomly with binary values i.e., 0s and 1s for the experimental purpose. For the first iteration using classifier, the fitness value of each data point is calculated. A random number r is generated (which depends on the size of the population) to differentiate between male (Np) and female (Nh). Equation (3) and (4) give the number of males np and number of females nh.",
  "(4)": "To extract Np and Nh separately, the data points are sorted in descending order according to their fitness value. The top np data points are separated as male in Np and the rest nh points are stored as female in Nh. There are two types of males, one is normal another one is dominant. The dominant ones are basically capable to mate with multiple females i.e., they much more efficient than the normal",
  "(6)": "Here, nd is the number of dominant males and nn is the number of the remaining normal males. The top nd number of males are denoted by Nd and Nn represents nn number of other males. For the mating purpose, the peahens with higher fitness values choose the dominant peacocks which are also of higher fitness values. Every peahen chooses one peacock of its choice. The dominant peacocks can be chosen by more than one peahen. After mating, the newborn peafowl are stored in a set called new. A newborn peafowl k, born with the peacock xi and the peahen xj, can be described as",
  "(7)": "where, rand is a random number generated for including a mutated behavior. The value of rand should be a fraction to properly regulate the positional value of the newborn. The value of rand lies between -1 to 1 (both inclusive). Some of the features of a newborn is acquired on its own due to evolution and it occurs because of the rand variable. Once the set of newborn peafowl is calculated as new, the value of newkd (i.e., dth dimension of the kth data point) can be either in the range of 0 to 1 or out of it. There is a need to transform the real values into binary i.e., 0 or 1 as the selected features are needed to be extracted. So, a probabilistic rule which is based on hyperbolic tangent function is applied to each dimension of the position vector. Equation (8) gives the formula of the function.",
  "(9)": "After that, the new peafowls are added to the parent set with their respective fitness values. Now, all the peafowls are sorted in a decreasing manner with accordance to their fitness values. The topmost n number of peafowls are selected for upcoming iteration. In this way, the process continues updating as well as adding the new peafowls and fetching out top n number of peafowls every time. This is done to obtain only the peafowls with higher fitness values and keep the size of the population constant. Finally, after completing all iterations, the peafowl having maximum fitness value is selected as the optimal feature subset. The experiment with the proposed model showed that it has performed better for the work of feature selection in terms of both decreasing the processing power and the memory requirement. In the proposed model, 1 and 2 are set to 1. r is a random value lying in the range [0.4, 0.6]. Both intensity of mating call I0 and colorfulness of the feathers C0 are set to 0.1 and is the dominance factor which is regulated at 0.8.",
  "The pseudo-code of the proposed algorithm is given below: Algorithm: Feature Selection based on PFM Algorithm Input: Dataset X which contains x number of records Output: Optimal Feature Subset Steps:": "1: begin 2: Generate population N with n number of datapoints 3: Set values for parameters r, , 1, 2 4: Calculate fitness of each peafowl 5: Sort them in decreasing order with respect to their fitness values 6: while (iteration < maximum number of iteration): do 7: while (season_number < maximum number of season): do",

Network traffic, from November 1st, 2006 to December 31st, 2015, is captured by the Kyoto University . To conduct experiments authors have collected a part of the benchmark dataset. Network traffic of March 30th, 2010 is gathered and after deleting all duplicate and redundant records, only 1,63,752 connections are taken for experimental purposes. Kyoto dataset contains 16 conditional features and 1 decision making feature . The portion of Kyoto dataset used in this experiment contains 74,837 numbers of normal and 88,915 numbers of attack instances. Both of the above benchmark datasets contain numeric as well as non-numeric conditional attributes. To transform these non-numerical values into numerical and for making the input suitable, preprocessing is done before the experiments. All non-numerical conditional features of both datasets are assigned with numerical values according to the number of occurrences of those particular feature values. Conditional attributes contain discrete and continuous values. Due to the combination of discrete and continuous values, the range of the feature values are not same. To make the range of all the features same and comparable, normalization is done. In the proposed model, to make the datasets normalized, min-max normalization method is used . After performing preprocessing and normalization NSL-KDD dataset as well as Kyoto dataset are used for performing the testing of the proposed model. 4.1.1. Experiments using Benchmark Functions The numerical proficiency of the proposed Peafowl algorithm is tested using 23 classical benchmark functions. To show the superiority of PFM, it is compared with a number of swarm-based optimization algorithms. The population size of 30 and 500 iterations are taken for each algorithm. All benchmark functions are explained in figure 3, 4 and 5.",

Comparative results show that the PFM algorithm provides very good exploitation. To evaluate the ability of exploration of the optimization algorithm, F8-F23 benchmark functions are considered. F8 to F23 functions are multimodal functions that include multiple local optima which increase exponentially with the size of the problem. Comparative results also show very good exploration capabilities of the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm. reflects that the proposed novel PFM algorithm makes a balance between the exploitation as well as exploration during the search and is also successful in finding the optimum solution. 4.1.2. Experiments using Datasets Datasets contain a number of attributes, among which some are useless and if those are not excluded, it takes more time for evaluation as well as the accuracy rate decreases.

Here, authors have taken NSL-KDD train dataset for training and NSL-KDD test dataset to judge the performance of reduced datasets. A number of different classifiers have been applied to measure the performance. presents the obtained results.

It is found that in every case, reduced set of features gave better performance as well as consumed less memory space. Hence, the proposed PFM algorithm creates a robust and efficient IDS.

Performance metrics of FSs1 of NSL-KDD dataset using RF in Scenario 1": "Scenario 2: In this scenario, both NSL-KDD train set (1,25,973 records) and Kyoto dataset are considered. 10-fold cross validation is applied on the two datasets. It means that a dataset is split into 10 sections or folds. The AC, DR and FPR of the classifiers NN, DT, KNN, Bagging and RF are noted in and 8. The classifiers are trained in two ways (i) classifiers trained with all features and (ii) classifiers trained with the selected FSs found by the PFM algorithm. The result shows that in most of the cases the selected subset of features gives higher accuracy and better results than the complete dataset. Apart from this, in this scenario a comparative study featuring the recent advancements in IDS on DR and FPR is shown. This study is presented in . From these comparisons, it is evident that the proposed IDS model based on Peafowl Mating algorithm performs better than other mentioned IDS models. The PFM algorithm detects intrusions with high efficacy resulting the DR to be 99.568% as well as rarely misjudges normal packets as attacks which generates FPR of 0.271% only on an average.",

As the data on cloud is placed at remote locations, the authentication of users to access data is becoming a serious threat. This is the time when the data scientists need to work on classifying the authenticated users and the intruders accurately as well as efficiently. An efficient IDS is needed to be developed to suffice this insecure situation. Figuring out the intruders is no less than the ultimate tough thing, as the size of data on Cloud is so large. This is why the algorithm should work in such a manner so that it processes the data most efficiently without compromising with the accuracy. The Peafowl Mating (PFM) Algorithm proposed in this paper has shown better outcomes through Feature Selection approach resulting in increased classification accuracy by reducing the dimensions of the dataset. The authors have shown that the proposed algorithm has performed better than the mentioned ones. As examined by the authors in this paper, the average accuracy of PFM algorithm during train-test scenario is 81.784% which shows the immense potency of this algorithm. The classification results on five different classifiers namely NN, DT, KNN, Bagging and RF show better results and proficiency of the proposed IDS. This proves that the proposed IDS model using PFM algorithm is capable of securing the Cloud environment from attackers. In the future, the proposed Feature Selection algorithm can be calibrated with the classifiers other than the ones used in this paper to perform experiments which may produce even better results. Therefore, an efficient IDS is created that can be deployed in a cloud environment"
