  "ABSTRACT": "Metabolite biosynthesis is regulated via metabolic pathways, whichcan be activated and deactivated within organisms. Understandingand identifying an organisms metabolic pathway network is a cru-cial aspect for various research fields, including crop and life stockbreeding, pharmacology, and medicine. The problem of identifyingwhether a pathway is part of a studied metabolic system is com-monly framed as a hyperlink prediction problem. The most impor-tant challenge in prediction of metabolic pathways is the sparsityof the labeled data. This challenge can partially be mitigated usingmetabolite correlation networks which are affected by all activepathways including those that were not confirmed yet in laboratoryexperiments. Unfortunately, extracting properties that can confirmor refute existence of a metabolic pathway in a particular organismis not a trivial task. In this research, we introduce the NetworkAuralization Hyperlink Prediction (NetAurHPD) a frameworkthat relies on (1) graph auralization to extract and aggregate rep-resentations of nodes in metabolite correlation networks and (2)data augmentation method that generates metabolite correlationnetworks given a subset of chemical reactions defined as hyper-links. Experiments with metabolites correlation-based networksof tomato pericarp demonstrate promising results for NetAurHPD,compared to alternative methods. Furthermore, the application ofdata augmentation improved NetAurHPDs learning capabilitiesand overall performance. Additionally, NetAurHPD outperformedstate-of-the-art method in experiments under challenging condi-tions, and has the potential to be a valuable tool for exploringorganisms with limited existing knowledge.",
  "INTRODUCTION": "Understanding metabolic behavior is essential across various lifescience fields, including crop breeding improvement, drug design,and bio-fuels . Metabolism describes the complex biochemicalprocesses occurring within a cell, which generally convert mate-rials entering the cell into substances necessary for cellular andorganismal growth and function .Metabolic pathways are described as linked series of chemicalreactions, where each reaction involves the conversion of one ormore molecules, known as substrates, into one or more molecules,known as products. In the context of metabolism these moleculesare called metabolites . While many metabolic pathways havebeen well-characterized, there is still much to discover .The reduction of data-collecting costs and the advent of newdata-mining technologies facilitate the construction models target-ing multiple aspects of metabolism . In this study, we focus ontwo types of data: (1) the metabolic network and (2) the metabo-lite correlation networks. Metabolic networks, hypergraphs wherenodes are metabolites and directed hyperlinks represent chemicalreactions, capture the known metabolic pathways of a particularorganism . Hyperlink prediction methods can be applied to metabolic networks to identify hypotheses of new unknown meta-bolic pathways . However, metabolic networks cannot indicatewhether or not the chemical reactions within a pathway took placein a set of samples.Metabolite correlation networks (Metabolite CN) capture thecorrelations between the quantities of metabolites . Metabo-lite CNs are constructed based on a high throughput collection ofmetabolic profiles of the organisms and do not depend on priorknowledge of the metabolic pathways. Contrary to the metabolicnetworks, Metabolite CNs are believed to provide a fingerprint ofan organisms underlying biochemical system and its regulatorymechanisms reflecting chemical reactions that actually happenedwithin a set of samples . This assumption is the theoretical justi-fication of the current study. Nevertheless, extracting informationabout chemical reactions from Metabolite CNs is a major challengedue to the extreme complexity of the problem .This research aims to exploit the information embedded in theMetabolite CN to predict the presence and absence of metabolicpathways in an organism. Specifically, we develop the network au-ralization hyperlink prediction model (NetAurHPD), which relieson a waveform representation of metabolites within the MetaboliteCN, combined with deep learning (DL) methods. The waveformrepresentation is obtained through the process of Network Aural-ization . The models are evaluated on Metabolite CNs of tomatopericarp . To mitigate the challenge of data sparsity, we suggesta simple data augmentation process that generates artificial Metabo-lite CNs given a subset of known reactions.

Consequently, covering all hyperlink candidatesin a prediction task becomes computationally infeasible. 2.1.3Negative Sampling. Most supervised link prediction mod-els suffer from an imbalanced training set due to the sparsity ofmost real networks (few links vs many non-links). This problemis exaggerated in hypergraphs where non-links include arbitrarysubsets of nodes.

  "Network Auralization": "2.3.1Network Auralization and Node Waveforms. In 2022 Puzis introduced an innovative application of sound recognitionneural networks to predict centrality measures of nodes within anetwork, by learning from the sound emitted by network nodes.Networks can be likened to resonating chambers, where soundpropagates through nodes and links, generating a waveform-basedrepresentation for every node.The core process of network auralization involves the propa-gation of energy among nodes to their neighbors until the totalenergy is evenly distributed throughout the entire network. 2.3.2M5 Architecture for Centrality Learning. M5 is a very deepconvolutional neural network, presented by Dai et al. for recog-nizing environmental sounds in urban areas. M5 is built from fourcore blocks: 11 Convolutional layer, Batch normalization and MaxPool layer. Average pooling layer and fully connected layer comesafter the convolutional blocks, as presented in Supplementary Fig6.Originally, M5 was designed for classification tasks with soft-max as output . For the purpose of his research, Puzis transformed the M5 architecture into a prediction task architectureby replacing the softmax layer with a fully connected layer, andshaping it as a regressor.Puzis trained several M5 models for various centrality mea-sures using auralized random graphs, including Erds-Rnyi andBarabasi-Albert. Later, these models were tested on larger versionsof the training graph types and also on well-known graphs like theKarate Club and the Southern Women Network. In the majority ofcases, high correlations between the ground truth and predictionswere observed, demonstrating that the combination of auralizednodes and M5 accurately reflect the network structure and theimportance of nodes.",
  "RELATED WORK3.1Predicting the Presence and Absence ofMetabolic Pathways": "Predicting the presence and absence of metabolic pathways inan organism is a common approach in the attempt to learn anorganisms metabolic network. By leveraging a novel metabolicpathways classifier, we will be able to uncover pathways and bridgeexisting knowledge gaps in the metabolic network.Toubiana et al. successfully classified metabolic pathwaysand identified undiscovered pathways in tomato pericarp. They constructed Metabolite CNs from three tomato datasets that weresampled across different seasons. Metabolite-level network fea-tures were extracted from these Metabolite CNs and aggregatedinto pathway-level features. Following feature selection, MachineLearning (ML) models were trained to detect known pathways oftomatoes, as well as pathways unrelated to tomatoes and randompathways. The Random Forest (RF) model yielded the best results,achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.932 and anaccuracy score of 83.78%. The classification of candidate pathwaysidentified 22 as potential tomato pathways. In vivo assays confirmedthe presence of one of these pathways.To the best of our knowledge and based on the available litera-ture, Toubiana et al. research stands as the only study to datethat utilizes Metabolite CN structure to identify metabolic path-ways. However, there is an extensive research effort dedicated topathway classification. Dale et al. were the pioneers in apply-ing ML algorithms to detect metabolic pathways by learning frombiological features, opening new options beyond the biological algo-rithms previously dominant in this field. Following the successfulresults, Dale highlighted the explainability of ML, which unlikealternative biological algorithms, enables researchers to understandwhy certain pathways were predicted to be present or absent.A decade after Dales publication, Basher et al. introducedthe mlLGPR solution, which also apply ML to detect metabolicpathways, and enabled scalability in both the coverage of organismsand parallel computation. Other notable studies were made by Joeet al. and Aljarbou and Haron , which applied the XGBoostand Support Vector Machine models, respectively. Both studiesachieved superior results compared to previous research.In 2022 Shah et al. integrated a DL architecture with an MLclassifying model. They fed Aljarbou and Harons features intoa fully connected network with two hidden layers. The networklearned the features and then used the network output to classifythe presence or absence of pathways using RF model.",

Within this category,methods utilize metrics like Common Neighbors score and KatzIndex score.Probability-based methods often employ various probability estima-tors, such as maximum likelihood estimation and Bayes theorem.Like Similarity-based methods, techniques in this category generatescores that often fail to capture and leverage high-order topologicalattributes.",
  "METHODS4.1NetAurHPD for Classification of MetabolicPathways": "NetAurHPD combines graph-based and DL methods to predict thepresence or absence of metabolic pathways in an organism basedon its Metabolite CN. The full suggested pipeline is illustrated inSupplementary Fig??. Inspired by Puzis innovative work, wewill develop a DL classifier based on aggregated metabolite signals,which function as hyperlinks.NetAurHPD requires two inputs, Metabolite CN (SupplementaryFig7.a) and a pool of labeled pathways (Supplementary Fig7.b), someof which occur in the organism and some do not. The Metabolite CNwill be transformed into an aural representation (SupplementaryFig7.c) as described in Algorithm 1, resulting in a sound repre-sentation for each metabolite (Supplementary Fig7.d). Using thelabeled pathways, we average the waveforms of each pathwaysparticipants by index (Supplementary Fig7.e) and producing a sin-gle sound representation for each pathway (Supplementary Fig7.f).Based on these pathway sound representations, we will train M5as classification model (Supplementary Fig7.g) to predict the classof each pathway (Supplementary Fig7.h).The core of M5 has four convolution blocks with the components:convolutional layer, Relu activation function, Batch normalization,and Max Pool layer, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig6. M5 learnseach signal input through a sliding window technique. The signalpropagates through the four convolutional blocks, followed byan average pooling layer and a fully connected layer, producinga single value. This value is then fed into a sigmoid activationfunction, yielding the final prediction. Loss function. Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) is a common lossfunction in binary classification problems. BCE measures the per-formance of each computed output, by comparing the predictionvalue and the actual class, 0 or 1. The cross-entropy for each sampleis calculated by the formula:BCE = ( log(()) + (1 ) log(1 ())) where denotes the true class of the -th sample.

  "Data Augmentation": "4.2.1Generation of Metabolite CN. Frequently, DL models excelwhen trained on large datasets. However, training such a model onlimited available data (low-sample-size regime) can be challenging.DL models trained over small datasets commonly struggle to gen-eralize and may tend to overfit. Data augmentation methods aim toincrease the size of the training data and face the low-sample-sizeregime challenge. Various approaches and methods exist for per-forming data augmentation. Some generate synthetic data usinggenerative models or simulations, while others apply transforma-tions to the existing data .In our research, we imitate the metabolic activity within anorganism, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig??. This section de-scribes the augmentation of the tomato pericarps metabolite pro-files. Therefore, the augmentation process may differ for otherorganisms.The required input for augmentation is the organisms path-ways in their directional format, allowing us to label the substrateand product metabolites in each pathway (Supplementary Fig??.a).The next step involves creating different \"Species\" (SupplementaryFig??.b), subgroups that represent organisms with variations intheir biological activity due to environmental conditions or geneticmanipulations . For each species, we generate several replicas,which are as the samples in the process (Supplementary Fig??.c).Each sample is a closed metabolic system that starts with a fixedconcentration level, uniformly distributed among the metabolites,meaning the number of units for each metabolite is not equal butsimilar.We mimic metabolic activity by executing a series of metabolicpathways (Supplementary Fig??.d). In each iteration, if the par-ticipant metabolites are in sufficient amounts, substrate are trans-formed into products. The process can stop after a fixed numberof iterations or when completing the pathways is impossible dueto the lack of required metabolites. Once completed (Supplemen-tary Fig??.e) we calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient be-tween every pair of metabolites (Supplementary Fig??.f) to generatethe Metabolite CN, referred to as Augmentations (SupplementaryFig??.g).",
  "EXPERIMENTS5.1Dataset": "To study the suggested pathway prediction models we used thedata provided by Toubiana et al. . The architecture requires twoinputs: 1- Metabolite CN constructed from organ samples, and 2labeled pathways for the classification task. 5.1.1Metabolite CN construction. In our case, we used a datasetcontaining metabolic profiles of the tomato pericarp for three har-vesting seasons: 2001,2003, and 2004. The data contains 4 to 6 bi-ological replicates of every introgression line, which is a uniquespecies developed by incorporating genes from one species intoanother, often from wild species into domestic crops. Each samplerepresents the concentration of a metabolite in the Introgressionline. As a preliminary step to constructing the Metabolite CN, thedata were normalized at both the sample and metabolite levels.Additionally, missing values were completed using a probabilisticPCA method available in the pcaMethods package in Rstudio.For every year a metabolite CN was constructed as describedin section 2.2, where the selected correlation threshold was set tobe || 0.3 and 0.01. For 2001 the Metabolite CN included 75metabolites and 473 links. For 2003 it comprised 75 nodes and 869edges, and for 2004 it had 78 nodes and 338 edges. 5.1.2Metabolic pathways for classification task. The dataset isdivided into tomato and non-tomato pathways as positive andnegative examples. Pathways were sourced from TomatoCyc, apathways collection of tomatoes and from MetaCyc which in-cludes non-plant pathways. Only pathways with more than twocompounds that appear in the Metabolite CN were included in thedataset. Specifically, the three Metabolite CNs contain 52 commonmetabolites, and only pathways with two or more compounds fromthis list were added to the dataset. From TomatoCyc 169 pathwayswere identified as sharing two or more common metabolites. FromMetaCyc 163 non-plant pathways were partially mapped to thecommon metabolites. To enhance model robustness, 85 randompathways were sampled as subsets of the 52 common metabolitesand labeled as negative targets (negative sampling). It should beemphasized that we assume all TomatoCyc pathways are presentin all three years.",
  "Training NetAurHPD on Tomato MetaboliteCN": "5.2.1Experimental Setup - Experiment 1. NetAurHPD will be testedseparately for each year: 2001, 2003 and 2004, using its MetaboliteCN. Additionally, in order to create a balanced target we had todown-sampling the negative class since there are 163 MetaCycpathways, 85 random pathways and only 169 TomatoCyc pathways.For each training session, we randomly selected half of the negativeexamples from the MetaCyc pathways and the other half from the random pathways subset, resulting in a balanced positive-negativedataset.Once we had the inputs, we followed NetAurHPD process tocalculate the predictions (Supplementary Fig7). Given the relativelysmall size dataset, we trained M5 on all samples without the needto split it into batches. We evaluated the proposed solution with 10-fold cross-validation, where each pathway in the dataset appearedonce in the validation set and received the model prediction. Basedon all validation set predictions, we calculated the micro-averageAUC and used Youden index to determine the optimal thresholdand compute the performance metrics. M5 Hyperparameter selection. This experiment involves a signifi-cant level of randomity. Negative examples are randomly chosenfrom MetaCyc and the random pathways for each new trainingsession, and the 10-fold split of pathways is also based on randomselection. Additionally, M5 weights and biases are initially set torandom values. Furthermore, the use of Augmentations, which willbe present later, includes an additional level of randomness. Due tothese factors, each training session can vary significantly, makingit impossible to compare models and optimizing parameters. There-fore, we used pre-defined parameters. The network dimensions aredetailed in Supplementary Fig 6. We employed the Adam optimizerwith a learning rate of 0.0001, a stride size of 8, and trained themodel for 300 epochs. The experiments described later will followthe same experimental design, unless stated otherwise. 5.2.2Experiment 1 Results. The left column in Fig3 displays NetAu-rHPD loss charts of representing folds in the 10-fold cross-validationtraining. We can see that across the three years the model man-aged to learn and improve as the loss decreased. However, afterapproximately 150-200 epochs, the loss stabilized and then beganto exhibit overfitting. In 2001 the micro-average AUC was 0.87 andthe optimal threshold was set to 0.44, resulting in an accuracy of0.80. For 2003 the micro-average AUC was 0.857 with an optimalthreshold of 0.54 and an accuracy of 0.80, consistent with the 2001results. In 2004 the micro-average AUC was 0.884 with an optimalthreshold of 0.48 and accuracy of 0.813. Results comparison to baseline. In general, NetAurHPD outper-formed random model results and presented comparable resultsto Toubiana et al. . present metrics comparison byyear between the abovementioned models. In 2001, Toubiana et al.performed better than NetAurHPD, demonstrating superior perfor-mance. In 2003, while Toubiana et al. still had higher overallscores, NetAurHPD showed better precision and a lower FPR. Con-trarily, in 2004, NetAurHPD outperformed Toubiana et al. across all metrics.",
  "Use Data Augmentation During Training": "DL models often require large amounts of data to reach high perfor-mance and prevent overfitting. The process of constructing Metabo-lite CNs, starting from assembling plant populations, is complex,time-consuming, and sometimes even infeasible. Additionally, otherorganisms might have fewer known pathways and smaller labeleddatasets. For these reasons, we aim to generate more data andenlarge the training set.",
  ": Micro-Average AUC of NetAurHPD sessions withAugmentations, by Model and Year": "pathways, we generate 10 Augmentations to be used in the trainingprocess.The design of the current experiment is based on the setup ofexperiment 1, however here we trained five different models foreach validation fold. The first model was trained on pathwayssignals from the original Metabolite CN. The other four modelswere trained also over signals from the Augmentations. As de-scribed above, in each epoch the model learned the signals fromevery Metabolite CN. The four models differed in the number ofAugmentations included in the training: 1, 3, 5, and 7. For everytrained model, the Augmentations were randomly chosen from the10 pre-generated Augmentations.We conducted 20 sessions of 10-fold cross-validation, each in-cluding the modeling of the 5 different models. Hyperparametersin this experiment are the same as in experiment 1 except that themodel learned over 800 epochs with a learning rate of 0.00001 toenable smoother convergence for the larger models.As mentioned, a basic assumption in our experiment is that allpositive pathways exist in the organism from which the Metabo-lite CN is derived. Therefore, for this experiment, we used only126 positive examples and randomly chose 126 negative examples,as done in experiment 1. Since 43 known tomato pathways weredropped from the trainset, some metabolites did not appear in theAugmentations and yet were involved in negative pathways. Hence,we were missing the waveforms for those metabolites and could notaggregate them into the pathway representation. To address thisissue, we manually added the missing metabolite to every sample(Supplementary Fig??.c). Ultimately, all of them had a degree of 0in the final Augmentation and had a waveform of ones, being notconnected to any node and unable to propagate the impulse. 5.3.2Experiment 2 Results. The right column of Fig3 displaysNetAu- rHPD with one Augmentation loss charts representingfolds from this experiment. We observe that the learning of NetAu-rHPD with Augmentation is prolonged compared to NetAurHPDalone, with a lower level of overfitting.",
  "NetAurHPD Advantages - Prediction inTough Realistic Conditions": "In real-world conditions, biologists may face organisms with alimited number of known metabolic pathways . Identifyingunknown pathways in these cases is significantly more challeng-ing than in well-explored organisms, where hyperlink predictionmethods relying solely on known pathways can be more effectivelyapplied.

In this experiment, weexamine scenarios where only a limited number of pathways areknown, and there are metabolites that do not appear in any pathway.We compare the performance of state-of-the-art CHESHIRE modeland NetAurHPD in two versions: one using the original MetaboliteCN and another using also one Augmentation. While NetAurHPDuses both Metabolite CN and pathways as input, CHESHIRE reliessolely on pathways.From the tomato pericarp dataset, we selected 32 metabolites in-volved in a minimal number of pathways. We excluded all pathwaysthat include these metabolites from the training set and created atest set consisting of 40 TomatoCyc pathways, 27 MetaCyc path-ways, and 13 random pathways. For each year, we conducted 10sessions, where in each session we trained the models on a largerportion of the training set, starting at 10% and increasing to 100%.The complete training set includes 129 TomatoCyc pathways, 65MetaCyc pathways, and 64 random pathways.

  "CONCLUSIONS": "In this research, we developed NetAurHPD method to predict thepresence or absence of metabolic pathways in an organism basedon its Metabolite CN. We trained NetAurHPD on three datasets oftomato pericarps Metabolite CN and achieved comparable resultsto the expert-based feature extraction model presented by Toubianaet al. .Additionally, we aimed to develop a data augmentation methodto enlarge the training dataset, which is often relatively small formany organisms. Data augmentation is particularly crucial for DLmodels, which generally require large datasets to achieve optimalperformance. In this research, we augmented the dataset by im-itating the organisms metabolic activity to generate additionalMetabolite CNs. This augmentation technique improved NetAu-rHPDs performance under mild conditions, prolonged its learningabilities, and mitigated overfitting.According to our results, the advantage of NetAurHPD is inchallenging real-world conditions where biologists are exploringorganisms with limited prior knowledge of known pathways. Insuch cases, NetAurHPD outperforms the state-of-the-art hyperlinkprediction method CHESHIRE, despite CHESHIREs outstandingresults under mild conditions. The results demonstrate the abilityof the Network Auralization method to learn the graph structurenot only at the node level but also at the subset level. Additionally,the results highlight the significance of using Metabolite CN as amodel input alongside pathway examples. However, NetAurHPD has a low level of explainability and can-not provide biologists with a full understanding of its results. Alter-natively, Toubiana et al. model offers a higher level of explain-ability due to its metabolite-level network features. In future work,NetAurHPD should be examined for its sensitivity to organismalperturbations, which are theoretically reflected in the MetaboliteCN, by evaluating the models ability to recognize changes in or-ganismal activity. Further investigation should also explore thepotential of using NetAurHPD for transfer learning.",

  "BMETHODSB.1Network Auralization Algorithm": "In formal terms, ( = (, )) denotes an undirected and unweightedgraph, where represents the set of nodes and the set of edges.Let , R denote the amount of energy held by node at time, considered as the nodes potential. The vector S = ( : )represents the vector of potentials of all nodes at time . In everyiteration of the diffusion process, each node potentially exchangesenergy with its neighbors. The delta between the quantities deter-mines the updated potential at time compared to time 1.Let stand for the adjacency matrix of , and = denotethe vector of nodes degree. Define , = ,/ to be the powerthat may apply on , which remains constant over time (unlikethe potential). The amount of energy that node applies to everyneighbor at time is: ,, = 1, ,. In matrix form,(S) is an matrix with values of S along the diagonaland = Diag(S1) . The potential vector is updated as:",

The energy flow will now be repre-sented as: ,, = 1, , + 1,,.Algorithm 1 presents the pseudo-code of network auralizationadapted for PyTorch implementation, the full source code is avail-able on GitHub: (ac-cessed on 23 March 2023). The operator is matrix transpose. Theoperators and aggregate elements of a matrix along thedimension specified by . For our research, the DC componentwhich refers to the values on which stabilizes after impulse re-sponse, is not of interest and will be removed from the vector.",
  "B.2Performance Metrics and ModelsComparison": "Given a set of probability predictions, the classes are often de-termined based on a defined threshold. A variety of performancemetrics can be used to evaluate the predicted classes and latercompare models. True Positive Rate (TPR), also known as recall, measures the ratio between the true positive predictions and allactual positive samples. False Positive Rate (FPR) measures theratio between the false positive predictions and all actual negativesamples. Accuracy represents the proportion of correct predictionsout of all samples .Moreover, another common criterion for comparing models isbased on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, whichdoes not depend on a predefined threshold. ROC curve is created byplotting the TPR on the y-axis as a function of the FPR at differentthreshold values. The AUC indicates the models performance level,where an AUC score of 1 means a perfect classifier and an AUCscore of 0.5 indicates that the classifier is no better than a randomclassifier (for a balanced target)."
