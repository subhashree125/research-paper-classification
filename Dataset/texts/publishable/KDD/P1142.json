  "Abstract": "AI for Science (AI4Science), particularly in the form of self-driving labs, has thepotential to sideline human involvement and hinder scientific discovery within thebroader community. While prior research has focused on ensuring the responsibledeployment of AI applications, enhancing security, and ensuring interpretability, wealso propose that promoting openness in AI4Science discoveries should be carefullyconsidered. In this paper, we introduce the concept of AI for Open Science (AI4OS)as a multi-agent extension of AI4Science with the core principle of maximizingopen knowledge translation throughout the scientific enterprise rather than a singleorganizational unit. We use the established principles of Knowledge Discovery andData Mining (KDD) to formalize a language around AI4OS. We then discuss threeprinciple stages of knowledge translation embedded in AI4Science systems anddetail specific points where openness can be applied to yield an AI4OS alternative.Lastly, we formulate a theoretical metric to assess AI4OS with a supporting ethicalargument highlighting its importance. Our goal is that by drawing attention toAI4OS we can ensure the natural consequence of AI4Science (e.g., self-drivinglabs) is a benefit not only for its developers but for society as a whole.",
  "Introduction": "The mission of science is the robust and efficient discovery and translation of knowledge. However,this process has historically been inefficient due to the inherently disjoint nature of the enterpriseformed of multiple agents acting asynchronously with varied levels of collaboration (if at all). Yet, thisasynchronous and disjoint behavior is natural as it is unrealistic for any single agent to be competentat all aspects of the knowledge discovery and translation processes, i.e., the processes by which rawdata is collected via experimentation, mined for patterns to develop hypotheses, and tested to validateknowledge assertions that are disseminated via publication. However, with recent advances in thefield of AI, particularly in deep learning, it is becoming increasingly clear that AI will transformthese processes and usher in this new field of AI for Science (AI4Science) with systems capableof being end-to-end experts in knowledge translation and discovery.",
  ": An Overview of the KDD process": "While this transformation is revolutionary, we contend that AI4Science has the potential to exacerbateissues, both ethical and practical, regarding effective collaboration and knowledge disseminationwithin the scientific community. For instance, self-driving labs, being a natural manifestation ofAI4Science, pose to have the remarkable capacity to automate knowledge discovery, but what happenswhen these systems are closed? Further, how will we mitigate misaligned incentives and motivationsthat limit the dissemination of derived findings? In essence, what of openness in AI for Science? It is critical we address these questions before such systems arrive. To that end, we present anextension of AI4Science under a collaborative multi-agent framing of Open Science , namelyAI for Open Science (AI4OS). We represent AI4OS as a Multi-agent Discovery Support System(MaDiSS) with the explicit intent of maximizing discovery for all stakeholders, transcending thelimitations of isolated, self-serving systems that could arise in AI4Science implementations agnosticto openness. While definitions of Open Science vary, we adopt that Open Science is a collaborative culture facili-tated by technology, promoting the open exchange of data, information, and knowledge among thescientific community and the general public, ultimately expediting scientific research and enhancingcomprehension\" . Crystallizing this sentiment with established definitions of data, information,and knowledge from the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) community, we de-velop a formal language to characterize each stage of the knowledge translation process. Leveragingthis language, we derive a theoretical optimization metric for openness to build an ethical argumentsupporting AI4OS. Lastly, we use MaDiSS to offer recommendations for promoting openness inself-driving labs and other AI-driven systems.",
  "The Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Process": "KDD provides useful and precise definitions of data, information, and knowledge, central to ourdefinition of Open Science. The KDD literature defines data as a set of examples collectedusing experimentation and a pattern as an expression in some language describing a subset of dataexemplars that is shorter than the enumeration of the entire dataset. We extend these definitions toinclude information as a set of these patterns that yield knowledge, a label placed on this information.The KDD process can be summarized in the following steps and is depicted in .",
  ". Interpretation of the generated patterns and translating the useful ones into terms understand-able by the user": "As stated by Fayyad et al. , the KDD process is iterative and may contain loops between anytwo steps in the process. For our purposes, the main limitation of KDD is that it assumes a single-agent perspective. However, we argue that a single-agent perspective is insufficient to model OpenScience as it is inherently collaborative among many disjoint agents. Rather, it is this multi-agentcommunication/collaboration that is crucial to a successful knowledge translation. Therefore, weshould consider three additional elements of the knowledge translation process, which to the bestof our knowledge, have not been formulated into a single coherent framework. These elementscorrespond to the successful communication of prior knowledge (1) from the experimenter to thedata miner and/or knowledge interpreter, (2) from the data miner to the knowledge interpreter, and(3) the decisive review of all propagated knowledge by the interpreter.",
  "Discovery Support Systems": "As our representation of AI4OS is formulated as a MaDiSS, we believe a brief review of traditionalDiscovery Support Systems (DiSS) is warranted. The first mention of DiSS came in 1986 whenDon R. Swanson developed a literature-based procedure for generating new hypotheses focused onbiomedical information . The first hypothesis emerging from his process proposed that fish oilcould be used to cure Raynauds disease and was later tested as well as experimentally and clinicallyproved . This research launched the field of Literature-Based Discovery (LBD) to infer new and useful knowledge by logically connecting information fragments from disparatetextual sources. As LBD has developed into an immense field, we point the reader to Gopalakrishnanet. al. for a complete review of recent LBD approaches focused on the biomedical domain andfor more general applications to Thilakaratne et al. and Hue et al. . While LDB techniquescan be leveraged in the context of our definition of MaDiSS, our framework and discussion are moregeneral than any individual methodology for discovery. Further, these approaches do not focus onour main contribution which is the knowledge communication between and consideration of eachagent in the translation process. A prime example of a modern DiSS as well as a MaDiSS is the US National Institute of Health (NIH)National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) Translator program which wasfounded with the mission to create a system capable of integrating existing biomedical data sets andtranslating those data into insights to accelerate translational research, generate new hypotheses,and drive innovations in clinical care and drug discovery.\" Importantly, the NCATS program takes anOpen Science approach where knowledge is shared and reasoned over by many different independentteams via API calls . These types of collaborative efforts come with their own set of ethicalconsiderations as they pertain to Open Science , Open Data andthe provenance of such systems and our framing subsumes these issues as well.",
  "A Formal Language of AI for Open Science": "In this section, our aim is to introduce a formal language to characterize AI4OS. We propose that auseful way to frame AI4OS is through a MaDiSS that aligns with the principles of Open Science. Theprimary motivation is that such a framing should enable researchers to conduct ethical assessments ofAI4Science-inspired systems in a unified manner. Our formalism begins by considering the three primary roles in a MaDiSS (and KDD in general),which revolve around dataset curation, information extraction, and knowledge labeling. Recognizingthat multiple agents can participate in each role, we define the knowledge required by each agent to : An overview of MaDiSS. The colored portions of the figure are illustrative of an arbitraryinstantiation of the translation process. (a) the experimenting agent(s) responsible for constructingany particular dataset di via experimentation. All di represents some sub-population of the globalground truth data, D with some instrumentation error . (b) The data mining agent(s) responsible forthe standard KDD process up until Step 7. (c) The labeling agent responsible for accepting/labelingnew knowledge as derived from information presented by the data mining agent. fulfill their specific role and represent the transfer of this knowledge to downstream collaboratorspromoting an open exchange of insights and expertise within their respective roles. These knowledgepriors and roles are as follows:",
  ". The knowledge base of the labeling agent, responsible for accepting, distilling and labelingthe information patterns in KDD Step 8": "We quickly define some common notation that we will assume and exploit later. We assume theuniverse of knowledge consists of a (potentially infinite) set of true knowledge K and a set of falseknowledge (also potentially infinite) Kc. We let A denote the set of all agents, human or otherwise,where |A|. Each agent has an assumed set of prior knowledge which is a subset of K Y Kc.While operating over the three role types (experimenting, mining and labeling) previously introduced,we allow agents to form teams in which they can belong to multiple or no teams along each roleaxis. Therefore, its possible that the same set of agents forming the same team can perform each rolein the pipeline. This situation is analogous to a self-driving lab. However, as in the real world,it is natural that an experimenting agent may have their data mined by many different data miningagents. Further, these mined patterns can be labeled by many different labeling agents. Since weare interested in the collaborative aspect of Open Science, MaDiSS provides a formalism for thetranslation of knowledge among teams. A visual depiction of MaDiSS is shown in . In thefollowing sections, we will outline each role more formally.",
  "between agents as it pertains to the experimenting process. Data sets, di P D, are collected by somemeans of experimentation which we assume to be informed by ki": "Grounding ourselves in KDD formalisms, a teams knowledge, ki, is a precursor to Step 1 in theKDD process, which is to say, ki is a set of prior knowledge on a domain that motivates the captureof data pertaining to that domain. Edges connecting ki to their respective data, di, in .a, canbe thought of as a sequence of decisions from steps 2-4 in the KDD processes used to aggregate andrefine data. While ki can contain elements of Kc, di should not be considered as right or wrong asdata will always represent some sub-population of true data, D, up to some measurement noise .However, since ki instantiates, di, it is possible that the sub-population di may not be suitable toachieve new knowledge in-line with K.",
  "The Data Mining Agent": "In the mining process (.b), data mining agents form data mining teams, tj A. While theagent pool remains the same, we use different team indices to denote the data mining teams. In otherwords, ti tj if and only if i j. Like experimenting teams, we assume data mining teams have arectified set of knowledge kj. kj is used to inform the data mining approach(s), Fj, applied over anyraw dataset di to extract patterns. We call the set of extracted patterns information and denote it Iij. Under the KDD lens, the edges that connect di and kj to Iij via Fj, in .b, can be thought ofas a sequence of decisions from steps 5-7 in the KDD process used to extra patterns from data. Thisincludes (5) choosing the function of mining, (6) selecting appropriate algorithms and parameters toproduce models, and (7) searching for patterns by leveraging these models, ultimately yielding Iij.Not included in the KDD pipeline is the explicit distinction between ki and kj. If i j then crucialteam knowledge from the experimenting processes is maintained during the data mining process.This is assumed in the KDD pipeline as it is framed from the perspective of a single agent. However,if i j then ki is potentially lost, resulting in potential misuse or misunderstanding of di. We arguethat this results in an Iij less suitable for achieving new knowledge in-line with the K and potentiallysubverts the intended use of di in regards to ki.",
  "The Labeling Agent": "In the labeling process (.c), labeling agents form labeling teams, tl A. Similar to datamining teams, we use different team indices for labeling agents to capture distinct teams. That isto say, ti tj tl if and only if i j l. Like the teams that came before, we assume labelingteams have a rectified set of knowledge qkl. The goal of labeling teams is to interpret patterns in Iijinformed by qkl and label those patterns to form a set of new knowledge labels, kijl, where ideally,kijl K, though in practice kijl likely contains elements in K and Kc. In .c, the edges that connect Iij and qkl to kijl capture step 8 in the KDD pipeline, whichproduces a set of labeled knowledge garnered from Iij. Similarly to the data mining step, the KDDpipeline does not formalize instances where knowledge is not propagated forward into the labelingstep. If i j l knowledge is maintained (again, this is assumed in KDD from the perspective of asingle agent). However, if l j then the labeling team runs the risk of misusing or misunderstandingIij, unless tj translated kj onto tl. We argue this potentially results in kijl containing less elements inK and more elements in Kc. This can be further confounded when j i from the mining processes,resulting in a less adequate Iij unless ti translated their ki onto tj. On the other hand, even if l j ortj translated their kj onto tl, if l i, the labeling team runs the risk of not understanding the initialbias in di resulting from ki unless ti translated their ki onto tl.",
  "Assumption 1 A human or machine cannot know with exact certainty whether any knowledgeelement in their knowledge base is a member of K or Kc": "We believe Assumption 1 is justified because no entity has direct access to K, and thereby, cannotbe fully certain on the membership of any individual piece of knowledge in their knowledge base.Since no upstream team can exactly know if their knowledge is in K or Kc, they should always passall provenance including accompanying confidence scores, allowing downstream teams to considertheir entire context and rectify on their own. The remaining portion of this section will provide abrief monotonicity argument to justify this claim along with potential entry points to aid knowledgetranslation between teams in line with the AI4OS mission. Consider an arbitrary di constructed by ti informed by ki as well as a data mining approach(s), Fj, oftj informed by kj. From the data mining teams perspective, the information, i.e., the set of patternsas defined by a set of chosen languages, yielded by Fj, denoted Iij, can be defined as the functionFj : D PpK Y Kcq PpPq where D is the set of all possible datasets and PpPq is the power setof all possible patterns, P, such that",
  "(1)": "where H is the set of other data mining teams knowledge for which the team tj may or may nothave access. It should also be noted that tj may or may not have access to ki. Similarly, the labelingteam, tl, also has their interpretation of information, Iijl, under their knowledge base and all theother teams knowledge bases of which they have access. This information can be defined as anotherfunction Gl : PpPq PpK Y Kcq PpPq such that",
  "(2)": "where kj may also be empty if inaccessible. If the data mining and labeling team are the same, i j,then Iij Iijl because both teams have the same set of combined knowledge. However, if theseteams are different, then it may not be the case that Iij Iijl. Consider a simple example in which the data mining team, tj, selects only one data mining approach.In other words, ||Iij|| ||Iijl|| 1. For the sake of this example, let the form of Iij and Iijl be aKnowledge Graph (KG) with nodes representing entities in some system and edges representing therelationships between those entities. For the data mining team, Iij is a construction algorithm Fj thatlearns the edges (relationships) from di. Now consider the instance in which qkl contains a piece ofknowledge that is absent in kj. This could be informed by some specific domain knowledge that statesthat two potential entities cannot not be directly connected in the KG. If kj is missing this knowledge,and they produce Iij with said edge, the labeling team could simply correct the information based ontheir (assumed to be) more complete knowledge base by removing the erroneous edge. However, thisnow transforms Iij into the new set of information, Iijl.",
  "Definition 1 Let X be a set and S PpXq. A monotone sequence of sets denoted xBnynPN P Sis monotonically increasing if @n P N Bn Bn`1 and is monotonically decreasing if @n P NBn Bn`1": "Assumption 2 The quantity Lpq X K is monotonically increasing with any monotonically in-creasing sequence of sets, xK`n ynPN` PpK`q, and the quantityLpq X Kc is monotonicallyincreasing with any monotonically increasing sequence of sets, xKn ynPN PpKq, whereN` r0, ||K||s and N r0, ||Kc||s. In other words, Assumption 2 tells us that the more prior knowledge that is incorporated from allteams in regard to K` the greater amount of new knowledge kijl aligned with K that is produced.Therefore, if ever a new piece of knowledge k P K is included into K`, the amount of new knowledgeproduced that is in K will never decrease. Similarly, the more prior knowledge that is includedfrom all teams in regard to K the greater amount of new knowledge kijl aligned with Kc that isproduced. We believe this is a justified assumption as included knowledge in K would never lead toa knowledge element Kc and vice versa.",
  "(4)": "The goal of knowledge translation, and by extension, a MaDiSS and AI4OS, is to maximize Equation4. However, recall that Assumption 1 states that the membership of elements in kijl is unknowable,so Equation 4 is not directly computable. Therefore, it is the job of a MaDiSS to approximateK, and by extension Kc. In fact, each teams knowledge resembles their best approximation ofa subset of K already. However, on receiving translated knowledge from upstream, we concludethat a successful MaDiSS should help process, filter, reframe, and/or reweight this knowledge toincrease the expectation that the amount of knowledge in K` is maximized and the amount in K isminimized. We argue this will maximize Equation 4 under Assumption 2. Lastly, two extensions toEquation 4 could be to normalize the metric with respect to the cardinality of kijl in order to compareacross domains as well as relax our assumption that all knowledge is equally important.",
  "Why Openness in AI for Science": "The pursuit of openness in AI4OS can be viewed as an effort to maximize knowledge dissemination,achieved through the effective conveyance of essential data and algorithmic provenance to theteam responsible for labeling knowledge as well as its intermediaries (Equation 4). Further, theoptimization of this process, which can better align generated knowledge with ground truth, can onlybe achieved by open knowledge sharing among collaborators. Therefore, we assert that the primaryethical concerns in AI4Science revolve around open access to and open communication of AI-derivedknowledge discoveries. Broad communication of knowledge discoveries is not a new ethical consideration and has beenhandled extensively by the Open Science community . However, a critical facetof analyzing the ethics of these systems involves examining their increased speed and autonomy.If these systems become entirely self-driven, the rapid acceleration of discovery may overwhelmour societys capacity to absorb it, as exemplified by the challenge of digesting the vast researchoutput from predatory journals and conferences . Accelerating knowledge discovery throughAI4Science without due consideration could further burden researchers and hinder scholarship. Another ethical concern is the risk of restricting open access to AI-derived scientific discoveries byindustry, governments, and the military. These entities may attempt to silo AI4Science implementa-tions for their benefit, limiting the knowledge available for labeling exclusively to their organizational unit. To uphold operationally moral standards, society should ensure diverse agent participationin knowledge translation teams and agents through increased regulation, auditing, and disclosure. Given the current self-regulatory environment of most AI companies , AI ethicists mustcontinue to press for specific enforceable and non-voluntary legislation of AI4Sciencesystems focusing their accessibility, transparency, and openness. Additionally, we must consider how denial of access could exacerbate existing societal inequitiesvia socio-technical forces. For instance, if new knowledge generated by a DiSS is used to accelerateindividual knowledge acquisition rather than novel scientific discovery, denying access to suchsystems based on social class or identity could further marginalize underprivileged populations,perpetuating systemic disparities. For example, consider an AI-driven system that aids in childhoodeducation by increasing the speed at which a child acquires new knowledge. Then denial of accessbased on class or identity could further limit a marginalized childs performance. This effect wouldfortify and continually widen systemic inequities among historically oppressed communities. Shifting our focus to specific ethical considerations within the MaDiSS formulation, we emphasize theimportance of the experimenting team documenting and transparently communicating assumptions,biases, and contextual factors affecting dataset collection, processing, or experimentation. Thisinformation is crucial for both the knowledge labeling process and data mining. Neglecting to providethis information may lead to mislabeled knowledge and exacerbate ethical concerns. While initiativeslike \"datasheets for datasets\" are steps in the right direction , a robust provenance architecture forcommunicating this knowledge remains an open challenge. The significance of Open Data initiatives and the role of provenance in databases has been extensively studied, particularly within the realm of biomedical data. However,the adoption of these practices within the machine learning community as part of the knowledgetranslation process has been notably sluggish and is poised to face further challenges with the riseof AI-driven systems. An associated area that has received inadequate attention, evident from aMaDiSS perspective, is the imperative to communicate data mining or algorithmic provenance toupstream consumers. The current focus in this domain has primarily centered on the reproducibilityof machine learning algorithms . However, MaDiSS underscores the need to go beyondreproducibility and ensure that downstream labeling teams consider the underlying algorithmicassumptions, biases, and contexts. Building on the framework proposed by Gebru et al., this could beimplemented through an \"information sheet for information systems\" approach, fostering communitycollaboration to identify intents, assumptions, and contexts that must be captured to enhance thesuccessful knowledge translation process and supports the adoption of AI4OS. Our final ethical consideration pertains to the role of the labeling team in acknowledging andconsidering the provenance provided by the experimenting and data mining teams. This aspectrelies on human autonomy, as knowledge labelers can choose to ignore provenance. As humanautonomy in the knowledge translation process becomes curtailed by AI4Science manifestationslike self-driving labs, this becomes increasingly problematic. Consequently, fostering ethical workcultures becomes imperative, wherein all providential knowledge is not only valued but also demandedfrom downstream agents. A pragmatic societal solution involves enhancing digital literacy amonglabeling teams, emphasizing the significance of these communication channels, and aligning with thecontextualist recommendations for AI use as presented by Chan . Nevertheless, this requirement to thoughtfully consider provenance encounters socio-technical resis-tance. AI professionals and researchers who currently leverage DiSS and soon AI4Science systemsinevitably contend with external pressures that may hinder their consideration of information or datacontext. These pressures could stem from impending deadlines, managerial demands, or market forces.Therefore, it becomes crucial for researchers to prioritize knowledge transfer, ensuring that theirrespective labels are well-informed to avert potentially detrimental consequences. Most significantly,this underscores a concluding ethical consideration directed at the developers of AI4Science.",
  "Conclusions and Future Work": "In this paper, we introduced AI for Open Science using a Multi-agent Discovery Support formalismthat aligns with Open Science ideals and highlights the need for openness within the AI for Sciencecommunity. We demonstrated the power of this formalism to make assertions that appropriate labelingof new knowledge is monotonically related to the degree to which the labeling agent understands the intent, context, and assumptions of the upstream teams. This imposes a clear ethic on allteams operating within an AI for Open Science paradigm to propagate their prior knowledge to alldownstream teams. Finally, we assessed ethical considerations of openness in the context of AI forScience justifying the need for systems to adopt an AI for Open Science framing. Additionally, we believe there are several fruitful directions for future work. First, Assumption 2must be empirically validated, perhaps through human team-based experimentation. Second, weneed to assess as a field the degree to which current AI-driven systems are effectively closed or open.However, for this to be accomplished we must develop a proxy for Equation 4 that is computable andprovably optimizes our openness metric.",
