  "ABSTRACT": "Accuracy and timeliness are indeed often conflicting goals in pre-diction tasks. Premature predictions may yield a higher rate offalse alarms, whereas delaying predictions to gather more infor-mation can render them too late to be useful. In applications suchas wildfires, crimes, and traffic jams, timely forecasting are vitalfor safeguarding human life and property. Consequently, finding abalance between accuracy and timeliness is crucial. In this paper,we propose an early spatio-temporal forecasting model based onMulti-Objective reinforcement learning that can either implementan optimal policy given a preference or infer the preference basedon a small number of samples. The model addresses two primarychallenges: 1) enhancing the accuracy of early forecasting and 2)providing the optimal policy for determining the most suitableprediction time for each area. Our method demonstrates superiorperformance on three large-scale real-world datasets, surpassingexisting methods in early spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.",

  "INTRODUCTION": "Spatio-temporal prediction, an innovative intersection of geographicinformation systems, statistics, and data science, plays a pivotalrole in fields where spatial distribution and temporal progressiondictate outcomes. This predictive approach finds wide-ranging ap-plications in domains such as meteorology, epidemiology, trafficcontrol, parking, and urban planning .Early spatio-temporal forecasting focuses on anticipating futureevents by examining patterns that change over space and time asearly as possible, which is essential to many real-world applicationssuch as epidemiology, environmental studies, and public safety,where early detection can lead to better management or preventionoutcomes. For instance, within the context of forecasting the spreadof diseases, the timeliness forecasting is considerably more criticalthan their accuracy. Predictions that are accurate but delayed canlead to the unnecessary loss of thousands of lives. On the otherhand, a prediction that is approximately accurate but made in atimely manner can significantly reduce the impact, saving lives. shows existing approaches to forecast spatio-temporalevents are categorised into three distinct strategies: Traditional,Fixed, and Adaptive. For example, Hochreiter et al. propose atraditional method that considers the entire recorded data beforethe forecasting. However, this approach can be time-consuming,particularly with large datasets, and its requirement for completeprior data collection often results in delays, which is unsuitablefor time-sensitive applications. Conversely, Lis approach operateswithin a set observation period , facilitating fixed timely fore-casts within a specific window. Although this strategy enhancespromptness, its fixed timing can result in inaccuracies if the ob-servation window is not optimally selected. Moreover, its rigidity",

  "RELATED WORK2.1Spatio-temporal Prediction": "It is evident that spatio-temporal prediction is of paramount impor-tance in numerous real-world applications , such as weatherprediction , traffic flow prediction , and earthquake predic-tion . Traditional time-series methods, including ARIMA ,have been extensively employed for prediction. With the evolutionof machine learning, deep learning methods such as Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) and Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) havedemonstrated superior capabilities in capturing temporal correla-tions. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are frequentlyutilised to capture spatial correlations in Euclidean space, whereasGraph Convolution Networks (GCNs) serve to model non-Euclidean relationships among nodes. Despite these advancements,fixed observation windows limit the ability of these models to ad-just their predictions in response to evolving data patterns, whichcould compromise their timeliness and accuracy, especially whendealing with rapidly changing data sources like traffic flow.",
  "Early Prediction": "Early prediction methods are techniques employed to make pre-dictions based on specific identifiable characteristics or temporalpatterns within a dataset. These methods can be classified into twocategories: shapelet-based methods and predictor-based methods.Shapelet-based methods involve finding small sub-parts ofthe time series data, known as shapelets , that can be utilisedfor prediction. Predictor-based methods involve com-bining a set of predictors built at different points in time with oneor more conditions or trigger functions to evaluate the reliability of",

Recorded values X = { }=1 refer to the mea-surements obtained from the nodes at time . forecasted valuesX = { }=1 are the estimates of the values at time based onthe graph neural network model. For instance, in a traffic speedforecasting scenario, could be the speed at sensor at time , and could be the forecasted speed at time . The optimal time seriest = { }=1 can guide the data observation process. For each node, the corresponding optimal time is the most appropriate thatthe forecasting accuracy is maximised and the time cost minimises.We aim to find the optimal time series that balances forecastingaccuracy and time cost.

  "The Spatio-temporal Predictor": "The main difference between traditional GCN and the Multi-GraphConvolutional Neural network (MGCN) is the addition of multipletime steps in the similarity matrix calculation in the latter. A stan-dard GCN calculates similarity based on spatial proximity or a singletime-point temporal similarity, leading to a limitation in capturingtime-evolving trends. MGCN improves this by including multipletime-step similarities, capturing more intricate time-evolving cor-relations, and facilitating timeliness. spatiotemporal predictor state generatoroptimal policies EncoderDecoder",

The policy utilises s to determine the optimal timefor each node V via the action set a = { }=1 (halt orwait).

The HVmetric measures the volume of the space dominated by the Paretofront found by the algorithm up to a reference point. A higher HVvalue means that the algorithm has found a set of solutions thatdominate a larger part of the target space, which is usually better. Smetric measures the distance between adjacent solutions in Paretofrontier. A lower S value is usually better, because it shows that thesolutions are more evenly distributed and provide decision makerswith a wider range of trade-off options.",

This approach allows us to explore different predic-tion timeliness and assess the corresponding prediction accuracy,where the accuracy is measured by the error between the ground",

We observe that: (1) When considering the same averageused time percentage, the STEMO model exhibits higher accuracycompared to LSTM, DCRNN, ASTGCN, and Graph-WaveNet. Theaccuracy of the STEMO model shows a lesser decrease when theaverage usage time percentage experiences an equivalent reduc-tion. This suggests that the STEMO model, which determines theoptimal time based on the networks dynamics, can adapt to di-verse scenarios, striking a balance between timeliness and accuracyin forecasting. In contrast, the fixed optimal time used by LSTM,DCRNN, ASTGCN, and Graph-WaveNet might not adequately ac-count for the dynamic nature of various scenarios. (2) When theaverage used time percentage is the same, the STEMO model out-performs EARLIEST in terms of accuracy. This improvement canbe attributed to the STEMO models consideration of spatial andtemporal characteristics, especially in scenarios like the METR-LA dataset, where the nodes are densely distributed and exhibitstrong correlations. The STEMO model leverages a Multi-GraphConvolutional Neural network (MGCN) that incorporates multi-ple time-steps similarity matrices and the distance matrix. Thisframework effectively captures and utilises the spatio-temporal cor-relations among the nodes. Additionally, our experiments revealedthat ASTGCN exhibits poor performance on the NYPD dataset. Thisoutcome could be attributed to missing values within the datasetand the limited representation ability of the model.As depicted in , above-average HV and lower S metricsfor the STEMO model indicate its effectiveness in managing a trade-off between accuracy and timeliness in predictions - our primaryobjectives in this study. A higher HV, as observed in the STEMOmodel, signifies not only better convergence, illustrating the prox-imity of the solution set to the real Pareto frontier, but also greaterextensiveness, indicating a broad coverage of the solution set in theobjective space. Additionally, it implies better uniformity, showingan even distribution of individual solutions in the set. This high HVvalue affirms our assumption that the STEMO model can effectivelybalance prediction accuracy while maintaining the timeliness ofpredictions and offer a wide array of diverse solutions. On the otherhand, the S metric provides a measure of the dispersion or spread ofthe solutions in the objective space. A lower S, as displayed by theSTEMO model, suggests that the solutions are evenly distributed.This means that the STEMO model offers a variety of optimal timesfor forecasting, and provides a robust and versatile model for vari-ous scenarios. This aligns well with our goal of creating a modelthat can cater to diverse situations with reliable results across arange of forecasting times. 5.2.2Ablation Study. To assess the contribution of individual com-ponents within our proposed STEMO model, we conducted anablation study using the NYPD dataset, the results of which are pre-sented in . In the ablation study, we evaluated the followingvariants of the STEMO model: w/o similarity matrix (without sim-ilarity matrix), w/o node embedding (without node embedding),w/o policy (without policy only use fixed value).As seen from , the full STEMO model consistently outper-forms all variants across different average used time percentagesin terms of MAE, RMSE, and MAPE. For instance, when the simi-larity matrix is removed (w/o similarity matrix), the performancedegrades, especially at lower average used time percentages. Thissuggests the importance of the similarity matrix in capturing spatio-temporal information to maintain the models performance even atlower time percentages. The removal of the node embedding (w/onode embedding) and the policy network (w/o policy) also leadsto a decrease in performance. This emphasises the significanceof the node embedding in capturing the spatial dependencies andthe policy network in adaptively determining the optimal time forpredictions. Overall, these findings underline the importance ofeach component and how they collectively contribute to the robustperformance of the STEMO model in balancing prediction accuracyand timeliness. 5.2.3Revealing hidden preferences. We modified the parameter to provide vectorised rewards for encoding two different objects:timeliness and accuracy. We used two different tasks (g1, g2) andused only 100 episodes to learn the hidden preferences. The derivedhidden preferences are depicted in . The learned preferencesof the model are concentrated on the diagonal, indicating thatthey are in good agreement with the actual potential preferences.For variant g1, the model shows a strong preference (0.67) fortimeliness. This result is consistent with the primary goal of g1,which emphasizes making predictions as quickly as possible. g2primarily focuses on accuracy, as evidenced by the significantlyhigher preference weight (0.97) for accuracy.",
  "DISCUSSION": "Although the STEMO model shows promise in handling early spatio-temporal forecasting tasks, several areas merit further exploration.First, the models performance might be restricted if it was primar-ily validated on a limited set of real-world datasets, which bringsinto question its generalizability to different scenarios or data types.Future studies could benefit from testing the model on a morediverse datasets from varying domains. Second, the models com-plexity might pose challenges in interpretation and computationalefficiency. Third, future work should aim to simplify the model orincrease its interpretability without sacrificing performance. Ad-ditionally, the models ability to learn hidden preferences requiresdeeper investigation.",
  "CONCLUSION": "We propose the Early Spatio-Temporal Forecasting model based onMulti-Objective reinforcement learning (STEMO) model, specifi-cally designed to address challenges in early spatio-temporal fore-casting. The STEMO model leverages the Multi-Graph Convolu-tional Neural network (MGCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)to capture and analyze spatio-temporal correlations. Further, it uti-lizes the hidden state from the encoders output in conjunctionwith node embeddings to adaptively determine the optimal timefor forecasting. Additionally, we also explore hidden preferenceswithin our model. Future work will focus on further refining ourmodel, exploring its application in other domains, and addressingany limitations encountered in this study. We believe that our re-search contributes significantly to the ongoing discourse in thefield of spatio-temporal forecasting and will serve as a foundationfor future advancements.
