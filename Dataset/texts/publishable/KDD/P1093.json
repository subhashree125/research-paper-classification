  "This study significantly advanced the development of state-of-the-art, efficient, and ethically sound cybersecurity solutions by addressing these gaps": "Materials and methods This section outlines our comprehensive methodology that integrates advanced machine learning techniques to enhance the detection and classification of network intrusions. The proposed method is illustrated in and detailed in Algorithm 1. Our approach primarily employs CNNs for effective feature extraction from sequential data. The CNN layers are adept at discerning intricate patterns within the data, making them particularly suited for analyzing complex network traffic and identifying potential anomalies. Moreover, we incorporate an attention mechanism to refine the feature extraction process further. This mechanism allows the 5 model to focus on specific data segments that are more indicative of intrusion activities, thereby enhancing the overall accuracy and efficiency of the detection process. To address the challenge of limited and imbalanced datasets, which can hinder the model's ability to simulate diverse intrusion scenarios, we employ a GAN.

The CICIDS2017 dataset is a comprehensive intrusion detection system (IDS) dataset featuring modern attack scenarios and network traffic patterns. On the other hand, the KDD Cup 1999 dataset is one of the most referenced datasets in network intrusion detection. It includes a wide range of simulated intrusions mixed with normal network traffic. Both datasets are integral for training and evaluating intrusion detection models, providing diverse scenarios to enhance the model's ability to detect various network intrusions. In our cybersecurity model's data preparation and preprocessing phase, we undertook extensive measures to optimize the training conditions. Initially, we eliminated all duplicate entries to prevent model bias towards overrepresented records. Subsequently, we transformed categorical features into numerical values using a label encoder, enabling the machine learning algorithms to interpret them effectively. After that, we applied a MinMax scaler to normalize the numerical values, ensuring that each feature contributed equally to the model's training process without any single feature dominating due to scale. Finally, we divided our dataset into training and testing subsets with an 80:20 ratio to effectively develop and validate our model. This methodical preparation was essential in achieving a robust and dependable anomaly detection system. 2.2 Attention mechanism 7 The attention mechanism, a significant innovation in deep learning, emulates cognitive attention and is widely used in artificial intelligence, notably in natural language processing and computer vision. Originally developed for Seq2Seq models in neural machine translation, it addresses a key limitation of encoder-decoder models: their struggle to capture and retain information from long input sequences in a single fixed-length context vector. The breakthrough by Bahdanau et al. . It has involved the creation of adjustable shortcut connections between the context vector and the entire input, enhancing significant parts of the input while diminishing the rest. This mechanism is critical for handling longer inputs, as it prevents the model from forgetting parts of the data. It calculates multiple attention weights, denoted by , to form the context vector for output as a weighted sum of annotations, using a softmax function:",
  "= (1, ) (3)": "Here, is the output score from a feedforward network aiming to align input at with output at . GANs, introduced by Goodfellow et al., represent a pivotal advancement in unsupervised machine learning. They consist of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through a competitive process. The generator learns to produce data resembling the training set, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and generated data. As training progresses, the generator improves its ability to create realistic data, and the discriminator becomes better at identifying generated data. This training continues until the discriminator can no longer reliably differentiate between real and synthetic data, indicating the generator's proficiency in producing data indistinguishable from the real ones. Due to its ability to model complex data distributions, this model has found extensive applications in various fields like image generation, super-resolution, and more. Our model uses a GAN to generate synthetic data for augmenting the training set. The GAN comprises two parts: a generator () and a discriminator (). The generator aims to create indistinguishable data from real data, while the discriminator evaluates whether the given data is real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by ). The training process involves a min-max game, represented by the following equation:",
  "a. GAN model:": "The GAN model's generator commences with a dense layer comprised of 30 units and employs a LeakyReLU activation function with an alpha of 0.01 to introduce non-linearity while mitigating the issue of vanishing gradients. The layer output is reshaped to form a sequence that matches the time steps of the input. The discriminator features a two-tier Conv1D structure, with the first layer comprising 64 kernels and the second 32, employing LeakyReLU activation and a stride of 2 for extracting features at varying scales. A flatten layer follows to convert the convolved features into a vector, which then feeds into a Dense layer with a sigmoid activation, producing a probabilistic assessment of whether the input sequence is real or generated. The model trains through an iterative adversarial process across several epochs, optimizing the generator to create indistinguishable data from real data and refining the discriminator's ability to classify the sequences accurately. Combining these two models, with their respective architectures and training parameters, is crucial to enhancing the system's capability in accurately detecting network intrusions, leveraging the CNN's feature extraction prowess and the GAN's data augmentation strength. 2.4 Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics: After completing the training, the performance of the Deep Learning model was evaluated using a series of standard metrics for classification problems, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix. These metrics provide distinct viewpoints on the model's performance and are constructed based on the concepts of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). These values are often depicted in a confusion matrix, a tabular layout that allows for visualizing the algorithm's performance. 2.4.1 Accuracy Accuracy measures the model's overall ability to predict both classes correctly, represented as the ratio of correctly predicted observations (both positive and negative) to the total number of observations. However, it may be misleading when the classes are imbalanced. The formula for calculating accuracy is as follows:",
  "(+++) (5)": "2.4.2 Precision Precision, or Positive Predictive Value (PPV), is a metric that assesses the proportion of accurate positive identifications among all positive identifications made. It is particularly crucial when the cost of a false positive is substantial. Precision is calculated by dividing the number of true positive identifications by the total number of positive identifications made.",
  "(+) (7)": "2.4.4 F1-score The F1-score is a quantitative measure that incorporates precision and recall, with equal emphasis on each metric. It obtains its highest value of 1 when precision and recall are perfect and its lowest value of 0 when absent. This metric is particularly useful in instances where the class distribution is imbalanced. The F1-score is determined by calculating the harmonic mean of precision and recall.",
  "(+) (8)": "3 Results and discussion 3.1 CICIDS2017 The results from the proposed method on the CICIDS2017 dataset, as shown in , indicate a consistent improvement in accuracy and loss metrics over ten epochs. Starting with an accuracy of 92.92% and a loss of 0.1781 in the first epoch, the model demonstrates progressive enhancement, reaching an accuracy of 97.93% and a loss of 0.0448 by the tenth epoch. Similarly, the validation accuracy improves from 95.47% to 97.90%, with a corresponding decrease in validation loss. The confusion matrix further substantiates the model's effectiveness with high true positive (TP) and true negative (TN) rates and relatively lower false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rates. The calculated precision, recall, and F1-scores for both classes are above 97%, indicating a high level of model reliability and balanced performance across different classifications. This performance suggests the model's robustness in accurately detecting and classifying network intrusions. Upon examining the CICIDS dataset, it becomes evident that the model exhibits impressive predictive capabilities, as evidenced by the confusion matrix and accuracy graphs provided. The training accuracy commences strongly and continues to increase steadily, while the validation accuracy tracks closely, suggesting that the model is acquiring generalizable features. The loss graphs reveal a consistent decline in training and validation loss, indicating a stable learning process across the epochs. The confusion matrix in indicates a high true positive rate, which signifies accurate attack detection. The true negative rate is also substantial, reflecting the model's precision in distinguishing normal behavior. The low false positive and false negative rates further confirm the model's efficacy. The precision, recall, and F1-scores suggest that the model performs with balance across classes, with values demonstrating high precision in differentiating between various types of network traffic. These outcomes are highly encouraging, reflecting the model's potential as a reliable tool for network intrusion detection in cybersecurity. The training curves for the CICIDS2017 dataset ( [a, and b]) illustrate a successful model optimization. The loss curve displays a sharp decline in the initial epochs, leveling off as the model converges, indicative of an effective learning process. Similarly, the accuracy curve shows a steep ascent in the initial training phase, reaching a high plateau, which suggests the model's high predictive capability. The training and validation curves are closely aligned, 11",
  ": The confusion matrix for the test data on the CICIDS2017 dataset": "3.2 KDD dataset The results from the proposed method on the KDD dataset over 10 epochs show significant improvement. The model began with an accuracy of 94.61% and a loss of 0.1843, rapidly progressing to an impressive 99.69% accuracy with a loss of just 0.0116 by the final epoch. This demonstrates the model's efficiency in learning and adapting to the dataset's characteristics. The validation accuracy also shows a similar positive trend, reaching 99.76%. The precision, recall, and F1-scores across different classes indicate high accuracy, especially for class 0. The model's slightly lower performance in classes 3 and 4 (with lower recall and F1-scores) might indicate a need for further tuning or more data for these classes. These results highlight the model's effectiveness in intrusion detection tasks using the KDD dataset. The model's performance on the KDD dataset has been depicted through loss and accuracy diagrams ( [c, and d]), demonstrating its efficient learning and strong generalization capabilities. The rapid decrease in loss and simultaneous rise in accuracy during the initial epochs highlight a robust learning process. The convergence of both metrics signifies the attainment of optimal performance. The close correspondence between the training and validation lines in both diagrams highlights the model's stability, suggesting that it has not overfitted and retains high predictive power for unseen data. This equilibrium is a hallmark of a well-tuned model suitable for deployment in detecting network intrusions. 12 The confusion matrix () derived from the evaluation of the KDD dataset affords a substantial quantity of true positives and true negatives, thereby exemplifying the model's aptitude in accurately classifying both normal and attack instances. The low false positive and false negative rates corroborate the model's potent discriminative capabilities, with minimal occurrences of misclassification. These findings are additionally substantiated by the precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, which illustrate exceptional model performance across a diverse range of classes. However, there is a discernible need for improvement in accurately classifying certain minority classes (0,1,2,3 and 4 represent normal, DoS, U2R, Probe, and R2L, respectively).",

The notable accuracy and minimal loss rates attest to these models' effectiveness in identifying intricate intrusion patterns. However, areas of improvement include addressing the variation in performance among different classes, particularly those that are underrepresented, by enhancing data representation and model tuning. Future studies should focus on overcoming class imbalance and refining models to improve detection in minority classes. Furthermore, exploring more advanced neural network architectures and diversifying the training data could lead to even more reliable and precise intrusion detection systems. 15",
