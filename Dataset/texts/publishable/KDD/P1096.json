  "Abstract": "Customers who reach out for customer service support may face a range of issuesthat vary in complexity. Routing high-complexity contacts to junior agents canlead to multiple transfers or repeated contacts, while directing low-complexitycontacts to senior agents can strain their capacity to assist customers who needprofessional help. To tackle this, a machine learning model that accurately pre-dicts the complexity of customer issues is highly desirable. However, defining thecomplexity of a contact is a difficult task as it is a highly abstract concept. Whileconsensus-based data annotation by experienced agents is a possible solution, itis time-consuming and costly. To overcome these challenges, we have developeda novel machine learning approach to define contact complexity. Instead of rely-ing on human annotation, we trained an AI expert model to mimic the behaviorof agents and evaluate each contacts complexity based on how the AI expert re-sponds. If the AI expert is uncertain or lacks the skills to comprehend the contacttranscript, it is considered a high-complexity contact. Our method has proven tobe reliable, scalable, and cost-effective based on the collected data.",
  "Introduction": "E-commerce customers may require varying levels of support when contacting customer service foran issue. A complex problem might require assistance from a senior agent, while a simple issue,such as a return or refund, can be resolved by a junior agent. Incorrectly routing a customer witha complex issue to a junior agent can result in poor customer experiences, such as transfers orrepeated contacts. Conversely, routing a customer with a simple issue to a senior agent is costly forthe business and limits the availability of senior agents for complex problems. Traditionally, contacts are routed through a machine learning model based on product line or servicetype. However, many contacts do not fit this model well and customers can experience differentlevels of complexity within a single product family. For example, a refund for a smartphone issimpler to resolve than a connectivity issue that requires troubleshooting. Additionally, customersmay encounter problems that span multiple products or services. The aim of routing is to provide customers with the best possible solutions, resulting in an optimalcustomer experience at the lowest cost for the business. To achieve this, we propose a new routingmechanism based on contact complexity. Upon reaching customer service, the customers profilewill be evaluated by a complexity model to determine its complexity score. If the score is high, thecontact will be routed directly to a senior agent. If the score is low, it will be routed to a junior agent.Contacts with a medium complexity score will be sent to the standard product-based routing model.The addition of the complexity dimension in the routing workflow can significantly reduce contacttransfers, repeat contacts, and unnecessary costs. A workflow chart of our proposed routing pipelinecan be found in Appendix .",
  "Tree index": ": The KL divergence boosting function is demonstrated for two different examples. Theboosting model has 60 trees. The divergence boosting function of Example 1 decays faster comparedto Example 2, resulting in a smaller integral, or skillfulness, for Example 1. It is important to notethat the divergence boosting always reaches zero when the tree index reaches its maximum number. However, defining complexity has proven to be a challenging task. This is due to several reasons,such as the highly subjective nature of complexity where a contact that is difficult for a junioragent may be easy for a senior agent. Additionally, only senior agents are capable of accuratelydetermining the complexity of a contact. While consensus-based data annotation by senior agentscould provide reliable and professional labels, the process of having them label thousands, if notmillions, of contacts to create a dataset is slow and expensive. To address these challenges, we have developed a novel machine learning approach to define contactcomplexity. Since senior agents are rare and costly, we trained an AI expert model that mimics theirbehavior. The complexity of a contact is evaluated based on how the AI expert reacts to it. Thisresults in a well-defined score, ranging from 0 to 1, which can be used as the ground truth label fortraining downstream routing models. Our method has been validated using objective and subjectivemetrics and proven to be scalable and cost-effective as it does not require human annotation.",
  "We propose an efficient and scalable method to determine contact complexity without theneed for human annotation": "Our approach not only provides a complexity score but also generates other relevant fea-tures such as sentence length, entropy, and skillfulness. These features capture the high-level content of a transcript and can be used as input for downstream machine learningmodels. Our work highlights the value of the intermediate steps of an ensemble boosting model.This aspect of the model is often overlooked in the scientific community, but our findingsdemonstrate that it can provide valuable insights into the input data. Related Works Our work draws significant parallels with previous studies that employ informationtheory quantities to characterize input data properties. The information bottleneck concept, forinstance, implements similar approaches and calculates mutual information between intermediateand final layer activations in a neural network to illustrate how data point noise is filtered throughthe network (Tishby et al., 2000; Tishby and Zaslavsky, 2015). While our method is similar, we useKL divergence and ensemble boosting. Another area closely related to our project is the classification of text difficulty, which examines thereadability of articles for different age groups of children to aid educators in crafting appropriatematerials. Our model is a prime example of how text difficulty can be linked to customer service.Other related studies on machine learning applications in this field can be found in (Balyan et al.,2020) and (Balyan et al., 2021). Additionally, the implementation of text difficulty in businesssettings such as healthcare is a noteworthy topic (Wang, 2006).",
  "The Dataset": "We utilize a dataset obtained from the MessageUS channel at Amazon. MessageUS is a text-basedplatform that allows customers to communicate with Amazons customer service agents. The datasetincludes multiple features for each customer interaction, such as chat transcripts, handling time, therequirement for third-party assistance, and the resolution of the customers issue. After each dialogue session, agents manually select a standardized issue code (SIC) to summarizethe topic and proposed solutions of each customer interaction. This SIC system is not unique toAmazon, as most eCommerce companies have their own version to provide a concise summary ofthe conversation. Its crucial to note that the dataset only contains customer text data, and all confidential information,such as names and account details, has been masked to protect privacy before being made accessibleto researchers. Although the dataset is obtained from Amazons internal database, its format isstandardized and comparable to customer service data that most companies possess. As a result, themethodology presented in this article is applicable to any other e-commerce company.",
  "The AI expert": "An AI expert is a machine learning model that has domain knowledge of the routing business. Thus,the simplest approach is to train a classifier that predicts the corresponding SIC code for a givencontact transcript. To train the model, we used 450,000 contact transcripts from January to March 2021 as input andaimed to predict one of the 152 possible SIC codes. The model algorithm was based on TF-IDF textembedding(Rajaraman and Ullman, 2011) and gradient boosting trees(Friedman, 2001), poweredby LightGBM(Ke et al., 2017). Similar algorithms, such as Xgboost(Chen and Guestrin, 2016)or Catboost(Prokhorenkova et al., 2018), could also be utilized. The model performance on thevalidation set was impressive, with an AUC(Kleiman and Page, 2019) score of 0.96 and top-15accuracy of 0.93, indicating strong connections between the transcripts and the SIC codes. Once the classifier is obtained, it can be considered an AI Expert with the domain knowledge topredict SIC codes. However, training a classifier for SIC codes is just one option. Another approachis to design a multi-label classifier that predicts multiple labels relevant to the routing business, suchas the need for third-party assistance, the resolution of the issue, and the requirement for a transfer.This could be accomplished with shared-weights neural networks(Goodfellow et al., 2016) or multi-label ensemble trees(Ho, 1995). This approach would offer a more knowledgeable AI Expert thatcan better identify the complexity of customer service issues. In this article, we only use the SICcode as a proof of concept.",
  "iSi,agent": ", where is kronecker delta function, Si is the speaker of i-th sentence in a contact tran-script. The above function is essential to count the sentences that agents speak. We inten-tionally ignore customers sentences because a customer may have multiple sentences ofconversation with the chatbot, and these sentences are usually less informative. uncertainty (E) = the entropy of AI experts output When a transcript is fed to ourAI expert (a classifier that predicts the SIC code), the expert will output the predictedprobability on each SIC code. If the expert is pretty confident about its prediction, theentropy of the output probability will be low and vice versa. Therefore, we can use entropyas an indicator of uncertainty (Shannon, 1948):",
  ", where Pi is the probability on class i": "skillfulness (S) = the integral of divergence boosting function The gradient boostingtree model combines the predictions of multiple ensemble trees to produce the final predic-tion. The more trees used, the more skillful the model becomes. The difference betweenthe outputs of a weak model (fewer trees) and a strong model (more trees) can be evalu-ated using KL divergence, which measures the difference between two probability distribu-tions(Kullback and Leibler, 1951). The boosting function (Zhou, 2021) of KL divergence isdefined as (i) = DKL(Pi||PM), i = 1 M, where Pi represents the output distributionusing the first i trees, and M represents the total number of trees in the model.The integral of the boosting function",
  "iDKL(Pi||PM)": "can be considered an indicator of the models skillfulness, with a slow decay to zero in-dicating the need for more knowledge or skills, and a quick decay to zero indicating lessneed. shows two examples of how the divergence boosting function behaves. Theboosting function of the first example decreases faster than the second, indicating that themodel requires more skills to handle the second example properly.",
  "Distributions of Hypotheses": "To simplify the characterization of complexity, we have defined three attributes: length, entropy, andskillfulness. These attributes were calculated for 450K contacts used to train the AI expert, and theresults are shown in Figures 2(a) to (c). The distributions of the attributes have long-tailed structures,with high-complexity contacts lying in the tail (red) region and low-complexity contacts lying in thehead (green) region. However, using three separate numbers to describe complexity can be complicated for the routingbusiness. Therefore, we aim to use a single variable that represents complexity in a more straight-forward manner. To do this, we normalize all the attributes to a similar range and combine themwith appropriate weights to create a single variable.",
  "Q = T UG C = T UG (2 L + E + S)": "The definition of Q is unambiguous. Our dataset comprises 450K contacts and we calculate thecomplexity score C for each one. If a contacts absolute complexity score C is above 95% of allscores, its relative complexity score Q will be 0.95. On the other hand, if a contacts absolutecomplexity score is only above 5% of all scores, its relative complexity score will be 0.05. Since Q is a value that ranges between 0 and 1 with a straightforward interpretation, we will referto it as the complexity score in subsequent discussions unless stated otherwise. This is the scorewe will use in our further analysis.",
  "Extreme Cases": "We have a goal of routing simple contacts to junior agents and complex contacts to senior agents.For this reason, we are particularly interested in cases where the complexity score, Q, is extremelylow or high. In , we present the distributions of all hypotheses, i.e. L, E, and S, for contactswith Q < 0.05 (pink), 0.05 < Q < 0.95 (green), and Q > 0.95 (blue), respectively. As seenin the figure, low-complexity contacts have relatively low values on all hypotheses, whereas high-complexity contacts tend to have similar properties but in the opposite direction. Contacts withmedium complexity scores have mixed properties in their distributions. This demonstrates that thecomplexity score, Q, effectively represents the level of complexity of a contact across all hypotheses.",
  "So far, there is no established metric to evaluate the complexity of a real-world contact. However,we have some indirect evidence to assess the validity of our approach to define contact complexity": "We conducted a visual inspection of 400 examples, which includes 200 high-complexity contactswith a complexity score Q > 0.95 and 200 low-complexity contacts with a complexity scoreQ < 0.05. The results showed that high-complexity contacts had a low resolution rate (resolvedcontacts/200) and a high transfer rate (transferred contacts/200). In contrast, low-complexity con-tacts had a high resolution rate and a low transfer rate. According to our survey, only 26% ofhigh-complexity contacts were resolved, and 62% underwent at least one transfer. On the otherhand, 85% of low-complexity contacts were resolved, and only 11% underwent at least one transfer.(Note: The resolution or unresolved status was determined by reviewing the transcript and deter-mining if the customers issue was resolved during the session. Ticket cutting, third-party assistancerequests, or follow-up calls were not considered resolved.) Although the dataset is limited and theresolution/transfer of a contact may not be solely due to its complexity, the significant differencebetween the two groups indicates that our complexity score accurately captures the concept of com-plexity.",
  "Direct Evidence": "We have validated our approach to defining contact complexity through both indirect and directevidence. We collaborated with senior Amazon agents to label the complexity of 400 examples,ensuring at least two agents reviewed each contact and reached a consensus label of low complex-ity, normal, or high complexity. shows the results of binning the complexity scores into20 intervals and counting the probability of finding a low, normal, or high complexity example ineach interval. The likelihood of finding a low complexity contact decreases gradually to 0.1 as the",
  "(g)(h)(i)": ": The distributions of hypotheses L, E and S are presented for high, medium, and low com-plexity contacts. (a)-(c) represent low-complexity contacts (Q < 0.05), (d)-(f) represent medium-complexity contacts (0.05 Q 0.95), and (g)-(i) represent high-complexity contacts (Q > 0.95).Low-complexity contacts tend to have small values on all hypotheses, while high-complexity con-tacts have similar behaviors but opposite directions.",
  "ratio": ": This plot shows the probability of finding high, medium, or low complexity based ondifferent scores. Over 400 ground truth labels were generated by senior agents. The dash linesrepresent the actual numbers, while the solid lines are fitted curves using polynomial functions. Theblue line represents low complexity, the red line represents medium complexity, and the green linerepresents high complexity. complexity score increases, while the possibility of finding a high complexity contact rapidly in-creases to 0.5 after a complexity score of 0.6. Our visual inspection of contacts labeled as normalwith Q > 0.9 confirmed that they were relatively tricky but not considered high complexity by theagents. This combined direct and indirect evidence supports the consistency of our complexity scorewith the agents understanding of contact complexity.",
  "Conclusion": "We have developed a unique method to measure contact complexity using an AI expert. Our ap-proach involves training the AI expert to mimic the process of assigning SIC codes to customercontacts and evaluating contact complexity based on the AI experts response. A contact is consid-ered high complexity if it is lengthy, uncertain, and requires more skills, and low complexity if itis short, straightforward, and requires fewer skills. Our approach has been validated through bothindirect and direct methods and has been found to be highly consistent with human perceptions ofcomplexity. With these results, we can train a routing model based on pre-contact data to route high and low-complexity contacts to appropriate agents using the complexity scores as labels. The numbers gen-erated by our models, including the hypotheses, absolute complexity scores, and relative complexityscores, provide valuable information about customer contacts and can be used as features for furtheranalysis. In the future, we plan to incorporate more automatically generated service labels into our AI expertto further increase its skillfulness and knowledge. Additionally, we believe that using an ensembleof AI experts to calculate the average complexity score would be an exciting area to explore. An en-semble model would offer a more robust and stable measurement of contact complexity and providebetter performance in real-world applications. Balyan, R., McCarthy, K. S., and McNamara, D. S.

Firstly, a complexity model will assessthe contact to determine whether it should be routed directly to senior or junior agents. If the contactdoes not meet the criteria for direct routing, a product-line-based model (here we use Amazonsproducts to demonstrate the idea) will then analyze the intent of the contact and direct it to theappropriate agents."
