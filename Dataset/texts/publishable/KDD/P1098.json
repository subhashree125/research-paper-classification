  "ABSTRACT": "Advances in graph machine learning (ML) have been driven byapplications in chemistry as graphs have remained the most expres-sive representations of molecules. This has led to progress withinboth fields, as challenging chemical data has helped improve ex-isting methods and to develop new ones. While early graph MLmethods focused primarily on small organic molecules, more re-cently, the scope of graph ML has expanded to include inorganicmaterials. Modelling the periodicity and symmetry of inorganiccrystalline materials poses unique challenges, which existing graphML methods are unable to immediately address. Moving to inor-ganic nanomaterials further increases complexity as the scale ofnumber of nodes within each graph can be broad (10 to 105).In addition, the bulk of existing graph ML focuses on charac-terising molecules and materials by predicting target propertieswith graphs as input. The most exciting applications of graph MLwill be in their generative capabilities, in order to explore the vastchemical space from a data-driven perspective. Currently, gener-ative modelling of graphs is not at par with other domains suchas images or text, as generating chemically valid molecules andmaterials of varying properties is not straightforward.In this work, we invite the graph ML community to address theseopen challenges by presenting two new chemically-informed large-scale inorganic (CHILI) nanomaterials datasets. These datasets con-tain nanomaterials of different scales and properties represented asgraphs of varying sizes. The first dataset is a medium-scale dataset(with overall >6M nodes, >49M edges) of mono-metallic oxide nano-materials generated from 12 selected crystal types (CHILI-3K). Thisdataset has a narrower chemical scope focused on an interestingpart of chemical space with a lot of active research. The second is alarge-scale dataset (with overall >183M nodes, >1.2B edges) of nano-materials generated from experimentally determined crystal struc-tures (CHILI-100K). The crystal structures used in CHILI-100K areobtained from a curated subset from the Crystallography OpenDatabase (COD) and has a broader chemical scope covering data-base entries for 68 metals and 11 non-metals. We define 11 propertyprediction tasks covering node-, edge-, and graph- level tasks thatspan classification and regression. In addition we also define struc-ture prediction tasks, which are of special interest for nanomaterial",

  "INTRODUCTION": "Graph machine learning (ML) has been applied to chemistry formore than 50 years , and describing molecules as chemicalgraphs goes back as far as 1874 . A big part of why tasks inchemistry are so relevant for graph ML is that chemical structures,such as molecules, can be expressively represented using graphs,where atoms are encoded as nodes with local attributes and chemi-cal bonds as edges with neighbourhood attributes .The recent advancements in deep learning methods havealso impacted graph ML. The class of deep learning methods thathave evolved to tackle non-Euclidean data can be viewed within thegeometric deep learning paradigm . Specifically, the class ofgraph convolutional networks (GCNs) and graph neural networks(GNNs) have shown widespread applications on graph-structureddata . Several key developments in graph deep learning werespecifically driven by applications on chemical graphs .The primary focus of the graph ML community has been in mod-elling organic molecules . Numerous studies have focused onpredicting target properties of such molecules based on their atomicstructure, posited as node- or graph- level tasks .The inverse task of obtaining structures corresponding to desiredproperties has been studied to a lesser extent . This is due tothe inherent challenges of performing generative modelling in thespace of graphs. While recent classes of methods such as denoisingdiffusion probabilistic models are showing potential for smallermolecules , the task of scaling these models to larger, anddiverse, molecular graphs remains an open challenge.The drive to develop novel materials with applications in batter-ies or catalysts for renewable energy storage has lead to new interestin inorganic crystalline materials, i.e materials with periodic atomicorder . A special case of such materials are nanocrystals,where the crystal dimensions are on the nanoscale. Modelling suchmaterials pose new and interesting challenges that are unlike thoseencountered in organic chemistry applications . Capturing theperiodicity and symmetry of crystalline materials are not easilydealt with using existing graph ML methods .This gets even more complex for nanomaterials where the scale ofobtained graphs span a broad range of atoms, between 10 to 105 .In this paper, we invite the graph ML community to bridgethe divide between existing methods to meet the complexity oflarge-scale inorganic materials chemistry. To this end, we make thefollowing contributions:",
  "(2) Provide two novel nanomaterial graph datasets.(3) Outline an array of property- and structure- prediction tasks.(4) Perform comprehensive benchmark experiments for the pro-posed tasks": "An overview of our data-generating pipeline is illustrated in. The data generation pipeline takes any source of crystallo-graphic information files (CIFs) (a file format containing symmetryand positional information) and creates graphs of finite nanoparti-cles with variable sizes. We thus assume the structure of nanoparti-cles to be the cutouts of larger crystals, whether constructed manu-ally or from a structural database. This is an approximation, as wedo not take into account e.g. surface relaxation and size-dependent : High-level schematic showing the five stages in-volved in the creation of the CHILI-datasets: (1) Querying andcleaning CIFs. (2) Extraction of crystal unit cells. (3) Expan-sion of unit cells into supercells and subsequent centering. (4)Cutting of nanoparticles into different sizes and padding ofedge environments following the described rules, conversioninto graphs with node- and edge- features. (5) Generation ofgraph-level properties from CIF (crystal type, crystal system,spacegroup, etc.) and simulation of scattering data. defects in the atomic structure. Each graph gets assigned relevantchemical labels, as well as simulated scattering data associatedwith each nanoparticle. The scattering data is simulated using De-byeCalculator . Using this generation pipeline we provide twonanomaterial graph datasets, CHILI-3K and CHILI-100K.The CHILI-3K dataset consists of 3180 graphs representing mono-metallic oxide nanomaterials generated from 12 different well knowncrystal structures, which are known to be taken by numerousmaterials. The resulting dataset captures a narrow chemical sub-space that is of considerable interest due to their environmental,medical and catalytic applications . The second dataset,CHILI-100K, consists of 104, 408 graphs generated by curating ex-perimentally determined structures from the Crystallography OpenDatabase (COD) . This dataset has a broader chemical scope asit contains datapoints for materials consisting of combinations of68 metals and 11 non-metals, thus spanning a much wider rangeof different crystal structures. While the CHILI-3K is classified asa medium-scale dataset (with >6M nodes, >49M edges in total),the CHILI-100K dataset is classified as a large-scale dataset (with>183M nodes, >1.2B edges in total) according to the Open GraphBenchmark (OGB) criteria . The two CHILI datasets are, to thebest of our knowledge, the first open-source nanomaterial datasetsof this scale. Together, we hope these two datasets will foster novelmethodological contributions at the intersection of graph ML andlarge-scale inorganic materials chemistry.",

  "CHILI-3K": "The CHILI-3K dataset contains nanomaterial graphs generatedfrom mono-metal oxides, which are a class of inorganic materi-als with a single metallic element coordinated to oxygen atoms inthe structure. They are often studied for their many interestingapplications . The unit cells in CHILI-3K are constructedbased on 12 of the crystal types described in West et al. , whichare known to be formed by mono-metal oxides.

All structures contain oxygen andone metal chosen from the 53 options as coloured blue in the peri-odic table in . Every combination of crystal type and metalis used, indiscriminately to whether the specific element is stable inthe particular crystal types. This is done with the intention for theCHILI-3K dataset to achieve complete coverage of the well definedpoints in this chemical subspace, leading to a total of 636 uniqueCIFs. H",
  "CHILI-100K": "The CHILI-100K dataset consists of nanomaterial graphs generatedfrom a subset of inorganic materials from COD . The subsetincludes materials which contains any of the 68 metals and 11 non-metals shown in orange in . COD was queried for bothpurely metallic phases and phases including combinations metalsand non-metals, like metal oxides. Materials containing elementsnot included in the shown selection were removed. For simplicity,only materials with unit-cell volumes smaller than 1, 000 3 wereused in order to avoid the inclusion of e.g. metal organic frameworksand larger inorganic coordination complexes. The result of the CODquery was saved as COD IDs in a csv file, which can be found inthe GitHub repository2.The corresponding, downloaded CIFs were cleaned for issuesthat caused the CIF to be unreadable or could potentially impactthe further analysis. From the original query to COD we obtain61794 COD IDs, which reduces to 20882 usable CIFs after cleaning.The specific choices used to clean COD to obtain CHILI-100K arereported in Appendix A.2.The CHILI-100K dataset is intended to mimic the data distribu-tion of real world materials. However, we want to emphasize thatthere is an inherent bias with using a database comprising experi-mental materials. This bias is towards known materials, which arestable and easier to synthesize, but it does not cover all possiblematerials in the chosen chemical subspace. This is especially im-portant to consider when tasked with generating novel materialsusing CHILI-100K.",

Different target properties that are ofinterest for inorganic chemistry are generated for both the datasetsand included to be either used as target variables or conditioninginputs. A detailed overview of the data structure with all the inputand target properties is presented in .",
  "Dataset statistics": "With the assumption that the true atomic structure of nanomaterialscan be approximated using the unit cell of the crystalline material,it is meaningful to consider the distribution of crystal systemsin the proposed datasets. The 7 crystal systems are a high leveldescription of the symmetry present in the crystalline material,going from triclinic (lowest symmetry) to cubic (highest symmetry).The distribution of crystal systems in the CHILI datasets are shownin a. From this it is clear that CHILI-3K only has the 4 crystalsystems with the highest symmetry present and that the cubicsystem is over-represented with almost 60 % of the data. However,this imbalance matches the crystal systems of the crystal types, asdefined in West et al. . The CHILI-100K dataset consists of all 7 crystal systems, but they are not equally distributed. The mostrepresented crystal system is orthorhombic, with about 25 % ofthe data, and the least represented crystal system is triclinic, witharound 7 % of the data. As the data was not selected from COD basedon the crystal systems, we can assume that the real distribution ofcrystal systems in inorganic materials is roughly the same as weobserve here.It is also interesting to look at the distribution of number ofunique elements in the nanomaterials in the two datasets, as thiscan be used as an additional way of determining structural diversityin the dataset. From b we see that CHILI-3K only containsnanomaterials with 2 elements, as it was constructed in this way.For CHILI-100K the number of elements range from 1 to 7, withmost nanomaterials having between 2 and 4 elements.As we are dealing with nanomaterials that have a finite size, it isalso relevant to look at the distribution of sizes in the two datasets.Referring to c, we observe that while some nanoparticlesmatch the specified generation size precisely, most structures ap-pear larger. This comes from the non-metals coordinated to themetallic particle core. Note as well, that the larger structural di-versity in CHILI-100K constitutes to a smoother size distributionthan that of CHILI-3K. Additional dataset statistics are provided inAppendix B.",
  "Data sources": "Graph datasets: Graph datasets can vary a lot depending on thedomain the graphs are from, their scales, and the types of tasksthey are designed to be used for. The OGB benchmark contains abroad overview of existing graph datasets , with single- andmulti- graph datasets being the two high-level types. The formerconsists of a single large graph, like knowledge graphs andsocial networks , which then has nodes and edges split intotraining, validation and test sets. These datasets are primarily in-tended for transductive learning such as node- or edge-level predic-tion tasks . Multi-graph datasets consists of many, often small,graphs. These could be molecular graphs or protein-protein in-teraction graphs , which are then split into training, validationand test set at the graph level. These kinds of datasets are mostlyused for inductive learning at the graph-level, but both node- andedge-level tasks are feasible too .Molecular graph datasets: As molecules can be easily rep-resented as graphs, datasets consisting of molecular graphs haveplayed an important part in the development of GNNs . Awide variety of molecular graph datasets exists for many differ-ent purposes, as seen in QM9 which is focused on densityfunctional theory (DFT) calculated molecular properties, ZINC ,which is focused on drug discovery, and MoleculeNet , which isa benchmark collection of molecular graph datasets within quantumchemistry, physical chemistry, biophysics and physiology. Structural databases: The structural databases in chemistrymainly contain crystal structures solved from crystallography ex-periments, and in some cases also synthetic crystal structures,which are stored in CIFs . A wide variety of structural databasesexists today, with some of the most widely used being the Cam-bridge Structural Database (CSD) , the Inorganic Crystallogra-phy Structure Database (ICSD) , the COD and the Materials Project (MP) .Material graph datasets: The representation of materials aresimilar to molecules in many ways, but differ in two critical aspects.Firstly, unlike molecules, materials feature diverse bonding typesacross varying scales. This makes the translation of the atoms in amaterial into nodes and edges less trivial. Secondly, materials are pe-riodic and often described only as their smallest repeating unit theunit cell and a set of symmetry operations called the spacegroup.Material graphs are, therefore, of similar scale as molecular graphs,but with added periodicity through the edges. Recently materialgraphs have garnered more interest with the growing popularityof MP , the publication of the Open Quantum Materials Data-base (OQMD) and the Open Catalyst datasets: OC20 andOC22 . The primary focus with these datasets has been in thediscovery of new catalysts and energy storage materials ,approximating DFT with ML and most recently foundationalmodels for materials .Nanomaterial graph datasets: Nanomaterials are distinguishedfrom other materials by their finite and small size, which invali-dates the assumption of long-range periodicity. Thus, to properlydescribe a nanomaterial, all atoms must be explicitly defined, whichsignificantly increases the scale of a nanomaterial graphs comparedto molecules and materials. Nanomaterials can be further catego-rized into nanoclusters nanomaterials with a size of < 1nm and upto 100-150 atoms and nanoparticles nanomaterials with a sizebetween 1 and 100 nm and upwards of 10s - 100s of thousands ofatoms . To our knowledge, only a few nanomaterial graphdatasets exist in the literature. We only know of one nanoclustergraph dataset from Fung et al (data from ) with 20,000configurations of 10 to 13 platinum atoms. We also know of somenon-graph datasets related to nanomaterials, like the dataset fromManna et al. with 63,015 DFT relaxed nanoclusters from 55different elements and the dataset from Barnard et al. with 425silver nanoparticles ranging in size from 13 to 2947 atoms.",
  "Graph ML tasks": "Material property prediction: Predicting material propertiesusing graph ML is an inductive learning task that necessitates gen-eralization of learnt behaviour at node- and graph- levels to unseenchemical graphs . There have been several attempts at feature-engineering as a means to do so; as this would circumvent theneed for graph representations . These methods usedescriptors from the materials that are agnostic to the arrangementof atoms within them. They rely solely on attributes such as stoi-chiometry, elemental statistics, electronic structure and the ioniccompound. For instance, an ML framework for formation energyprediction using a total of 145 attributes including those mentionedabove was proposed in Ward et al. . Other studies considerthe periodic crystal structures of the materials and expand upon the principles of crystallography to derive periodic graphs whichgives insights into material properties . Some salientexamples include the crystal graph convolution network , thataims to capture atom interactions across the cell boundaries byusing multi-edge graphs, and the atomistic line GNN , thatconsiders not only the distances between neighboring atoms butalso the angles at which they are arranged within the crystal lat-tice. These models have been shown to perform well on predictingseveral structure properties, including formation energies. Still,to our knowledge, only few attempts have been made to modelproperties associated with materials that lack long-range order;like nanomaterials, clusters, as well as amorphous- and disorderedmaterials .Inverse materials design: Using graph ML for materials de-sign poses a more challenging task than property prediction tasks.In this setting, the structure, or a set of potential structures, of amaterial that match desired properties or functions are explored.Latent variable models are used to this end, as they can be used ingenerative settings while respecting any conditioning inputs likethe atomic composition of the material, catalytic ability, stabilityor structural characteristics such as those derived from X-ray andneutron diffraction experiments . Xie et al., for instance, employa crystal-diffusion variational autoencoder to generate stable crys-tal structures . They encode materials into a lower-dimensionallatent space, from where a property predictor network predictsattributes such as composition and lattice parameters and trans-lates them into crystal structures by applying them to randomlyinitialized unit cell structures. A GNN is then used to optimize theatomic positions until reaching equilibrium. In a similar manner,Merchant et al. investigates the use of GNNs for the purpose ofdiscovering new crystal structures in their recent work . Theiterative training process of these specific GNNs, known as GraphNetworks for Materials Exploration, includes filtering potentialstructures according to initial predictions and then validating en-ergy computations with DFT. When it comes to inverse design fornanomaterials on the other hand, little progress has been made.Recently however, some advancements have been achieved in de-termining the atomic structure of nanomaterials using scatteringdata. Specifically, Kjr et al. introduce DeepStruc , a conditionalvariational autoencoder that is capable of determining the atomicstructures of a subset of mono-metallic nanoparticles directly fromtheir pair distribution functions (PDFs) derived from total scatter-ing data. DeepStruc successfully determines structures from PDFsoriginating from seven distinct structure types. This is achieved onboth simulated and experimental PDFs.",
  "EXPERIMENTS AND BENCHMARKING": "To characterise the two CHILI datasets across different experimentswe perform a selection of classification-, regression- and structuregeneration- tasks. For each task, we also report simpler baselineslike random prediction, most frequent class (MFC), and mean pre-diction, wherever appropriate. We use a range of off-the-shelf GNNmodels as backbone networks and add an additional linear layeras the last layer to predict the appropriate number of classes orregression targets.

  "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION": "We next present the results for the different tasks described in Ta-ble 3. An overview of results on both CHILI datasets for all theproperty prediction tasks are reported in , and for the struc-ture generation tasks in . High-level trends observed foreach task type are outlined next. Note that the methods in are sorted in increasing order of their complexity measured as thenumber of trainable parameters in the GNN-backbone (See in Appendix C for exact numbers).Classification: The naive predictors (random, MFC values) pro-vide a useful baseline when comparing the more sophisticatedGNN-based methods. In a majority of the scenarios, across thethree classification tasks and the two datasets, all GNN-based meth-ods do better than these naive baseline methods. In instances wherethe GNN methods do worse than these baselines, it could be ex-plained by factors such as sub-optimal hyperparameters and limitedtraining time.For the CHILI-3K dataset, EdgeCNN which is the most com-plex model in terms of the number of parameters, consistentlyoutperforms the other GNN-based methods across all the threeclassification tasks. This is an interesting trend which points to theusefulness of learning and aggregating features along the edges.This is in contrast to using node attributes along with the existingedge attributes as done with GCN and GAT .The CHILI-100K dataset which is more challenging comparedto the CHILI-3K dataset is reflected in the poor performance in allclassification tasks by bulk of the GNN-based methods. In particular,crystal_system_number classification appears to be challengingfor all the models. Regression: Regression tasks are generally more difficult fordeep learning models, due to factors such as incorrectly tunedbias parameters . Furthermore, the specific regression tasksformulated in these benchmarking tasks are more complex thanthe classification ones. This additional complexity could be dueto the globalness of the prediction tasks, the dimensionality ofthe predictions, and lack of informative features in the input. Thedifficulty of these regression tasks is reflected across the board,including both CHILI datasets, where the mean prediction seemsto perform comparable to the GNN methods. This performancediscrepancy between mean prediction and GNN-based methods isclearer for the pos_abs and edge_attr tasks.For the regression of scattering data (saxs,xrd,xPDF), the per-formance trends of the GNN-based models are slightly better. Meth-ods like EdgeCNN again shows better performance comparedto other methods. It is important to note that in the materials chem-istry community the focus isnt typically on estimating scatteringdata from material graphs. This is primarily because the scatter-ing data can easily be simulated, as demonstrated with the CHILI-datasets, using open-source software such as DebyeCalculator .Consequently, the primary use of scattering data lies in the inversetask, such as using experimental scattering data to infer the atomicstructure of the material. This being said, there are still potentialvalue in accurately modelling scattering data from material graphs,particularly in the pursuit of discovering new materials. By doing so,researchers can explore the intricate relationship between structureand scattering data, facilitating data-driven approaches to materialdesign. Examples of scattering data used in these prediction taskscan be found in Appendix D.1.",

Reliable estimates of thesetwo target variables can be used to generate structures.For both CHILI-3K and CHILI-100K, the structure generationtask show moderate errors across all different types of scatteringdata, as reported in . The structure generation model gen-erally performs better on the CHILI-3K dataset. The discrepancybetween the two CHILI datasets reflects the broader structural di-versity present in the more complex CHILI-100K dataset. Samplereconstructions of predicted nanoparticles are provided in Appen-dix D.2.Structure generation with the unit_cell_pos_frac target yieldsbetter reconstructions of the unit cell fractional coordinates. No-tably on CHILI-3K, MAE values drop as low as 0.008 using xrd.This outcome is expected, particularly on CHILI-3K, where the unitcell positions of each structure are tightly constrained, rangingfrom 0 to 1, and the unit cells themselves are mutually very distinct,which reduces the structure generation task to a form of classifica-tion into the 12 crystal systems visualized in . Even then,a moderately higher MAE using saxs is to be expected. This isprimarily because of the nature of SAXS data, which inherentlylacks information on the unit cell parameters. The slightly higherMAE on CHILI-100K is due to the presence of moderately moreirregular unit cells. Examples of unit cell reconstructions can befound in Appendix D.2.",
  "CONCLUSION": "In this work we have presented a chemically-informed approachto generate large-scale graph datasets of nanomaterials. Usingthis approach we have provided two novel nanomaterial graphdatasets: the medium-scale CHILI-3K dataset from mono-metaloxides with a wide range of interesting applications, and the large-scale CHILI-100K dataset from an experimental materials databasewith high structural diversity.The two CHILI datasets were benchmarked on 11 property pre-diction tasks using naive baselines and 7 off-the-shelf GNN models.The results show that all property prediction tasks are tractable,but also difficult enough that none of the off-the-shelf models areable to achieve usable performance for chemical applications. TheEdgeCNN model performs best in general, which could be attributedto the layer architecture or that it has the most trainable param-eters. Some tasks, like atomic_number classification and pos_absregression, shows a tendency for the models getting stuck in localminima. We therefore think that future work focused on these taskswould be of high impact. The datasets were also benchmarked on 6 structure predictiontasks using a simple property-to-structure model. The results showthat, in a simplified setup, these tasks are tractable and harder tosolve for discrete particles than the crystalline unit cells. This high-lights the need for more work to address the challenges related togeneration of variable size graphs and to achieve sub-ngstrm po-sitional precision, which would be useful for chemical applications.Limitations: Both CHILI datasets assume that a discrete nanopar-ticle can be approximated using the unit cell from the crystallinematerial. This is not entirely physical, but we find it to be an accept-able trade-off for not having to relax all nanoparticles using DFT,which would require significant expertise and additional computeresources.Because of the way that CHILI-3K is constructed, the fractionalatomic positions in the unit cells are identical across structures ineach of crystal type subsets. Models trained for unit_cell_pos_fracprediction tasks should therefore not be validated only on thisdataset. We do not expect and have not observed any effects of thison the other tasks.The data in CHILI-100K is generated from a database of experi-mental materials, which has an inherent bias towards easily synthe-sized and stable crystalline materials. The data does, therefore, notcover all parts of the relevant chemical space equally and does notaccount for potential differences in stability between crystalline-and nanomaterials. This is especially important to consider if theCHILI-100K dataset is used for generating novel nanomaterials.The benchmark experiments were performed with limited hyper-parameter tuning. The specific performance obtained by the GNNmethods could be improved further by meticulous hyperparametertuning or including additional tuning of the network architecture.Open challenges and future work: The prediction of 3D coor-dinates in chemical systems is an open problem in the chemistry andML literature. This includes the chemical validity of the predictionand the consideration that the relative positions compared to thewhole molecule or (nano)material are often more important thanthe absolute positions. We think the CHILI datasets can be an im-portant contribution here with the multitude of complex positionaldata and the associated scattering data, which can be used as inputsignals, or measures for prediction quality.Generative modelling of graphs with variable number of nodesand/or edges is an open problem in the graph ML literature. Solvingthis could revolutionize the field of generative graph ML, and thusalso helping materials chemistry. One of the key limitations of thecurrent state-of-the-art is the lack of datasets to facilitate scalabilityof graph generative models. We hope that the CHILI datasets canbe an important contribution.

Each crystal type isdescribed by its fractional atomic positions and its spacegroup. Westet al. also provides table values for the unit cell parameters ofselect materials for each crystal type, which we use to estimate theunit cell parameters of each combination of elements and crystaltypes. This is done by fitting linear functions to the relationshipbetween each unit cell parameter and the sum of atomic radii ofthe elements in the chemical formula. The CIF generation code canbe found here.",
  "A.2Crystallography Open Database query": "The CIFs from the Crystallography Open Database (COD) was queried using the code found here. TheCIFs were then cleaned using the code found here. The cleaningprocess is described in words below.We used the ase.io.read function from ASE to load theCIFs. Major issues that were known and could be fixed included:generation loop errors, empty columns which we fill with 0s, andsyntax errors - specifically non-closed parenthesis to indicate un-certainties. Issues such as parts of the file missing or less commonlyseen errors, could not be fixed and the files were therefore removedfrom the dataset.Occasionally, we would observe minor issues where the periodic-ity of the unit cell would be affected by an insufficient floating-pointprecision on certain rational fractions such as 1/3 or 1/9. Through anempirical study, we found that a precision of less that five decimalplaces would lead to periodicity errors, potentially displacing atomsout of the intended symmetry site. We detected such floating-pointnumbers and increased their precision to five decimal places.We also found that some CIFs contain two-letter elemental sym-bols that have both letters capitalized. This leads to issues wherethe elemental symbols are read incorrectly, such as copper (Cu)being read as carbon (C). This is difficult to detect, but to our knowl-edge quite rare. We handled the worst cases, where a material isinterpreted as containing no metallic elements, by simply removingthese files from the dataset.",
  "A.3Nanomaterial graph generation": "We here in more detail explain the graph generation of the CHILIdatasets, which is outlined in (step 3 and 4). The nanoparti-cle generation is done using the generate_nanoparticles utilityfunction from DebyeCalculator (Found here). This approachrelies on approximating the real nanoparticle structure as cutoutsfrom crystalline materials.Step 3: After reading the CIF with ASE (step 2), the unitcell is expanded into a supercell that we ensure extends at leastthe largest nanoparticle diameter plus an additional 5 ngstrms() of padding along each axis. The supercell is then centered bymoving the most central metal atom into origo and the distance ofall atoms to the center is calculated to make it easier to determinewhich atoms are within a cutoff distance.",

We define the interaction neighborhoods as 125 %of the elements atomic radii in crystals. Atomic radii values wasaccessed using the Mendeleev package (Data from Slater etal. ). The extra 25 % is added to allow for atoms in distortedcoordination environments to still be connected. In the border-casewhere all atoms are too far apart and no overlaps between interac-tion neighborhoods are found, 110 % of the smallest distance in theunit cell is used as the radius of the interaction neighborhood. Thisapproach to determine atom connectivity creates more edges inthe final nanomaterial graph than using the true 1st coordinationshell of the atoms. However, that would be way more expensive tocalculate and we think this approach is a more realistic approxima-tion of interaction than using a fixed-size local neighborhood todetermine edges or using a fully connected graph.Step 4: The metallic core of the nanoparticle is found simplyby checking whether the distance of a metal atom from origo issmaller than or equal to the given radius. The non-metals in thenanoparticle is determined by one of two things: (1) if the distanceto origo is less than or equal to the given radius or (2) if its inter-action neighborhood is overlapping with the metallic core of thenanoparticle. For both datasets we generate nanoparticles with 5,10, 15, 20 and 25 as the radii.",

As described in the paper, we usea hidden layer size of 64 and then use our default values from theGCN model for the rest.GIN: We use the graph isomorphism network (GIN) modelwith fixed to 0, the GIN-0 variant. The same hyperparameters areused for the GIN model as we used for the GCN model.EdgeCNN: We use the EdgeCNN model, but without recom-puting the graph at every layer as it is not a part of the out-of-the-box model. As described in the paper, we use a 4-layer EdgeCNNmodel with a hidden layer size of 64. The rest of the hyperparame-ters use the default values from the GCN model.GraphUNet: We use the graph U-Net model with the defaultpooling ratio of 0.5. The paper observes improved performance withdeeper networks until a depth of 4, however we use only a depthof 2 because of memory constraints. The other hyperparametersare the same as the default values from the GCN model.PMLP: We use the propagational multi-layer perceptron (PMLP) model with default initialization values. The same hyperparametersare used for the PMLP model as we used for the GCN model. : Number of trainable parameters in the GNN back-bone. These numbers are not accurate for the node-leveltasks, atomic_number classification and pos_abs regression,because the feature dimensions of the final GNN layer aredifferent.",
  "C.3Task setup": "For the benchmarking of prediction tasks, we chose all classificationtasks, see , and all regression tasks except for SANS, ND andnPDF, see . These 3 were excluded from the benchmarkingas they show a high degree of similarity with SAXS, XRD andxPDF respectively and the scattering intensity of X-rays is morepredictable than neutrons as it scales with the number of electrons.Node-level tasks: For all node-level tasks, the final GNN layerhas feature dimensions matching the number of classes, see , or the size of the regression target, see .Edge-level tasks: For the edge-level task, the final GNN layerhas 64 output features. The dot product of the output features oftwo nodes connected by an edge is then calculated to predict thedistance associated with that edge.Graph-level tasks: For all graph-level tasks, the final GNN layerhas 64 output features. The graph is then summarized by concate-nating a global mean, sum and max pooling, which is then passedthrough 2 fully connected linear layers with a ReLU activationfunction in between. The input size of the linear layers are 192,which is 3 times the number of output features, and the final outputsize matches the number of classes, see , or the size of theregression target, see . The hidden layer size is determinedas the midpoint of the input and output dimensions.Generative tasks: Before being parsed to the MLP model, thescattering data undergoes min-max normalization. The MLP modeloutputs a single vector of size equal to 3 times the maximum numberof atoms (see ) to accommodate all Cartesian coordinates(, and ). A mask is derived from the ground truth structure to restrict the propagation of loss to errors on the coordinates of theatoms present in the ground truth structure. Before comparing thestructures, the coordinates in the ground truth structure are sortedin ascending order according to their distance from the origin.",
