  "Abstract": "This research aims to improve the accuracy of com-plex volleyball predictions and provide more mean-ingful insights to coaches and players. We introducea specialized graph encoding technique to add addi-tional contact-by-contact volleyball context to an al-ready available volleyball dataset without any additionaldata gathering. We demonstrate the potential benefitsof using graph neural networks (GNNs) on this en-riched dataset for three different volleyball predictiontasks: rally outcome prediction, set location prediction,and hit type prediction. We compare the performanceof our graph-based models to baseline models and ana-lyze the results to better understand the underlying re-lationships in a volleyball rally. Our results show thatthe use of GNNs with our graph encoding yields amuch more advanced analysis of the data, which notice-ably improves prediction results overall. We also showthat these baseline tasks can be significantly improvedwith simple adjustments, such as removing blocked hits.Lastly, we demonstrate the importance of choosing amodel architecture that will better extract the importantinformation for a certain task. Overall, our study show-cases the potential strengths and weaknesses of usinggraph encodings in sports data analytics and hopefullywill inspire future improvements in machine learningstrategies across sports and applications by using graph-based encodings. IntroductionAs the sport of volleyball has gotten more popular and play-ers have begun joining at younger and younger ages, thelevel of play has also increased. This increase in popularityand the subsequent improvements in player skill have leadto increasing demands for tactical analysis and better gamestrategies. These demands come with a greater necessity forcomputational analysis of the sport.With recent increases in interest for sports data analyt-ics through all sports, we have seen an increasing num-ber of studies looking into predicting game events (Simp-son et al. 2022), analyzing team and individual playerperformance(Claudino et al. 2019), overall sport develop-ment(Nadikattu 2020), and predicting or analyzing overall",

For example, the sports ofBasketball, Soccer, and Baseball have seen several studies.Basketball has seen several datasets released and otheranalysis(Jain and Kaur 2017; Thabtah, Zhang, and Abdel-hamid 2019), (Miljkovic et al. 2010)(Miljkovic et al. 2010;Mahmood, Daud, and Abbasi 2021; Tian et al. 2019) forpredicting game outcomes, improving player developement,predicting rising stars, or identifying opposing teams offen-sive and defensive strategies. Soccer (Simpson et al. 2022;Decroos et al. 2019; Rudrapal et al. 2020; Baboota and Kaur2019; Prasetio and Harlili 2016; Sawchik 2015; Whiteley2007; Sun, Lin, and Tsai 2022; Huang and Li 2021; McPher-son and MacMahon 2008; Chun, Son, and Choo 2021; Aoki2010) have also seen studies focused toward a variety tasksincluding game event and outcome predictions, posture anal-ysis, game lineup prediction, and injury risk assessment.Despite growing interest in sports analytics, studies onthe sport of Volleyball have been limited so far. The fewstudies that have been conducted have tended to have smallscopes and use basic naive approaches, yet they have yieldeda promising start and a good baseline to compare with. Withthe increasing need for more and more sophisticated dataanalytics strategies, we wish to introduce specialized encod-ings and models for the sport of volleyball to improve uponthese current baseline approaches without the need for gath-ering additional data. Related WorkThere have been a few recent datasets and studies for indoorvolleyball(Ibrahim et al. 2016; Wenninger, Link, and Lames2020), but they are primarily focused toward computer vi-sion and are not the most useful for tactical analysis ortracking in-depth game statistics since they are missing sev-eral important game variables. There has also been a recentbeach volleyball dataset(Wenninger, Link, and Lames 2020)that has been more useful for tactical analysis, but due todifferences between beach volleyball and indoor volleyballprimarily the additional players and more strict positions inindoor volleyballthis dataset is limited solely to beach vol-leyball analysis. Lastly, a recent study(Xia et al. 2022) in-troducing a specialized indoor volleyball dataset has made anoticeable leap in the field.Xia et al.(Xia et al. 2022) has introduced a simple yetpowerful natural language to represent a volleyball rally",
  "arXiv:2308.11142v1 [cs.LG] 22 Aug 2023": "as a sequence of rounds that each consist of a sequenceof 1-4 contacts (pass, set, hit, block) and gathered a largedataset of NCAA and Professional mens volleyball games.This dataset has allowed much deeper and more usefulgame statistics to be captured and analyzed, and this paperalso demonstrated some promising results in several never-before-analyzed tactical analysis tasks. The authors demon-strated some impressive results with simple naive modelswhen predicting the winner of a rally, predicting where asetter will set the ball, and predicting what type of hit a hit-ter will use. All of these tasks are valuable for a team todetermine more optimal offensive and defensive strategiesunder different scenarios. This paper does, however, leaveroom for improvement. The data used in this study is raw,the approaches are naive, and the authors never explore anyforms of encoding their data to improve performance sincethey are simply introducing baselines that their language iscapable of. Given the temporal sequence heavy format of thevolleyball language, we decided to explore temporal graphbased encodings for this language and dataset.Graph based encodings have shown promising results foranalyzing other sports, such as American football, basket-ball, and soccer. One recent study uses graph encodingsand Graph Neural Networks to predict various sports out-comes(Xenopoulos and Silva 2021). This paper focuses oncreating a sports-agnostic way of representing game-statesusing graph encodings. Through this technique, they are ableto capture inter-player relationships and local player rela-tionships that can otherwise not be taken into account whentraining a model. Further, the paper tests its player-specificgraph approach on American football and a popular esportsgame, Counter-Strike. Through their methods, they demon-strate a reduction in test loss by 20% and 9% for footballand Counter-Strike respectively. A similar work uses GNNsfor predicting future player locations and movements(?).The work focuses on multi-agent sports such as basketballand soccer and takes advantage of both GNNs and Vari-ational RNNs to generate these future locations. Throughthese techniques, they show that the statistical player distri-bution of their generative model predictions outperform pre-vious works. Further, they also test their model using condi-tional prediction to answer questions such as: How will theplayers move if A passes to B instead of C? Insight into theseconditional relationships is highly tactically useful when de-termining new strategies or how to optimize individual play.Since many sports can have data be well represented withgraph structures, graph encodings would likely work wellin the sport of volleyball in several areas. With the currentleading dataset(Xia et al. 2022) especially, using a graphencoding might better represent the data. For instance, theoriginal dataset does not give the deep learning models anyinformation as to which variables belong to which contactin a given ball round. On top of this, there is no informa-tion describing the temporal ordering of the contacts givento the models. To give this additional context information tothe deep learning models and allow for a better representa-tion of a volleyball rally without needing to gather any addi-tional data, we propose encoding the volleyball round datainto a graph structure and using Graph Neural Networks to",
  "Graph EncodingTo analyze our graph encoding, we must first look at whatinformation the baseline dataset has to offer": "Underlying Data RepresentationFor this study, we will use the leading indoor volleyballdataset (Xia et al. 2022)(Xia et al. 2022). This dataset splitsvolleyball matches into a sequence of rallies and splits eachrally into a sequence of rounds. Each round contains vari-ables describing round information (team and round num-ber), various locations of ball contacts, pass and set rat-ings, hit type used, blocking information, and serve type.As explained earlier, all of this informationbesides thetwo round level variablesrelates to each individual ballcontact. Pass contact location and pass rating relate to thepass contact, set rating and location relate to the set contact,etc. All of this points to a contact-level encoding being anexcellent option to test. Traditional sports GNN based ap-proaches usually focus on mapping player interactions withgraph structures as the interactions and locations of play-ers are typically the most important variables to analyze forfree-flowing sports such as basketball or soccer, howeversince the sport of volleyball has the teams separated by thenet and a very rigid rule set to follow, the player interactionsand locations become less useful to analyze since there isless freedom and instead the interactions with and locationsof the ball and ball contacts become much more importantinformation to focus on. Thus, this VREN Dataset(Xia et al.2022) primarily focuses on ball interactions, and our analy-sis with a contact-level graph encoding will attempt to aug-ment the information from these ball interactions. Encoding MethodsIn order to attach the variables to their correct contacts andencode the temporal format of the contacts, we must con-sider each contact as a node of the graph and add each con-tacts important information to that node. For example theset contact node will hold the setter location, set rating, andset destination variables and the hit contact node will holdthe hitter location and hit type variables. Then to encode thetemporal aspect of the contacts, we will connect each con-secutive contact with a one way edge from first contact tosecond contact. For example, in a round with a pass, a set,and a hit, we would connect the nodes with one way edgesfrom the pass node to the set node and from the set nodeto the hit node. All edges will have equal weights, and thedataset does not include any other useful information to in-clude in edge attributes. Though a simple graph encodingmethod, it fundamentally changes how a neural network willanalyze the data. Rally Outcome Prediction TaskSince the baseline rally outcome prediction task in theVREN paper(Xia et al. 2022) considers all information ina round (except the winning team and win/lose reason), wewill use all the nodes for a given round to make a prediction. location location embedding hitting type hitting type embedding setting type setting type embedding timestamp RallyGraph Encoder block information ... round sequence Blocking sequence Receiving sequece",
  ": Our framework for taking raw round sequence data, encoding into a Graph structure, then making a rally outcomeprediction": "As such, we end up with a graph involving a pass node, thenset node, then hit node, then block node. These graphs willinvolve the exact same information as is used in the baselinetask, but will just have a new graph encoding. Set Location Prediction TaskThe baseline set location prediction task in the VREN paperonly uses the information in a round up to when the setteris about to set the ball. If we were to follow this same strat-egy, our encoding would involve only 2 nodes (pass and setnodes) in each graph, and very small graph sizes seem toyield poor GNN performance. However, we can include in-formation from the hit and block nodes of the previous round(if there is a previous round in that rally). From further base-line testing, this additional information does not noticeablyeffect performance in any baseline model, so any perfor-mance changes with this task will be solely from the graphencoding. Therefore, for this task each graph involves theprevious rounds hit node (if it exists), the previous roundsblock node (if it exists), the current rounds pass node, andthe current rounds set node only including information frombefore the setter contacts the ballsuch as where the setterwill set the ball from. Hit Type Prediction TaskSimilar to the set location prediction task, the baseline hittype prediction task in the VREN paper only uses the in-formation in a round up to when a hitter is about to hit theball. For this task, we decided to add in the previous roundsblock node to reach a consistent graph size of 4 nodes for better GNN performance. As with the set prediction task,this additional information yielded no difference in baselineperformance. So for this task, each graph involves the previ-ous rounds block node (if it exists), the current rounds passnode, the current rounds set node, and the current roundshit node only including information from before the hittercontacts the ballsuch as the location the hitter will be hit-ting from. MethodsWith the graph encodings set up, next we turn to the modelswe will test. To keep comparison consistent with the base-line, we will test a GCN to compare with CNN, a GraphGRU to compare with LSTM, and a Graph Transformer tocompare with Transformer. To Implement all of these mod-els, we will use Spektral, a GNNs package built on Ten-sorflow and Keras. Since this package does not include aGraph Transformer Convolution layer, we implemented onemodeled off of the Graph Transformer architecture intro-duced in Shi et al.(Shi et al. 2021) which has shown excel-lent results for Graph-based learning tasks. We used Ten-sorflow and Keras to build this Graph Transformer Convo-lution Layer off of the base MessagePassing layer availablein Spektral. This Graph Transformer architecture performsself-attention on graph edges with queries embedded fromthe node features for the origin of the edge and keys and val-ues embedded from the node features for the terminal of theedge. This architecture also includes gated residual connec-tions between layers, a key factor making this architecture aTransformer.",
  "Models Tested": "For the rally outcome prediction task, we will analyze allthree of these GNN structures performances just like thebaseline, but for the other two tasks, we will analyze theTransformer and CNN/GCN architectures only since theRNNs tend to struggle on these volleyball tasks for a num-ber of reasons. The GCN architecture we used for all tasksinvolved one Graph Convolution Layer, a graph global pool-ing layer to get a graph level value, then 3 dense layers.The Graph GRU architecture we used involved a GatedGraph Convolution Layer with a GRU Gate, a graph globalpooling layer, then 2 dense layers. Lastly the Graph Trans-former architecture we used for all tasks invloved one cus-tom Graph Transformer Convolution Layer, a graph globalpooling layer, then 2 dense layers. The rally outcome modelshad a single float output with a sigmoid activation functionon the final output layer to yield a probability value between0 and 1; these models used MSE as their loss function fortraining, and MAE, binary accuracy, AUC, and Brier Scoreas metrics for validation and testing. The set location modelshad an array of 9 values as an output with a softmax activa-tion function on the final output layer to yield probabilitypredictions for each set location that sum to 1; these modelsused the cross-entropy loss function for training and cate-gorical accuracy as metrics for validation and testing. Thehit type models had an array of 8 values as an output with asoftmax activation function on the final output layer to yieldprobability predictions that sum to 1; these models also usedthe cross-entropy loss function for training and categoricalaccuracy as metrics for validation and testing.",
  "Hit Type Prediction Task Modification": "We decided to modify the original Hit Type Prediction taskto make it even more useful for tactical analysis. To do this,we decided to ignore blocked hits. First, this will make iteasier to predict hit types as the other hit types are relativelypredictable given the set rating, locations, and other infor-mation in this dataset, but whether the ball is blocked or notdepends on much more than the information in the dataset.This means that including the blocked hit type will end upconfusing the models since they are missing the necessaryinformation to predict if a player will be blocked. Second,removing blocked hits will focus the task on more importantpredictions. Predicting if a hitter will be blocked providesessentially no use in tactical analysis, as strategy on both theoffensive and defensive sides will not change if you knowthat a hitter will or will not be blocked. The offensive teamwill see no tactical gain in not covering their hitter when theyknow they wont be blocked and the defensive team will seeno tactical gain in allowing their non-blocking players to re-lax on the court because they know the ball will be blocked.The other hitting types are much more tactically useful to beable to predict, so we will focus the Hit Prediction Task onthose hitting types and seek to improve performance there.We ran the same baseline models on our modified version ofthis task for comparison with our graph-based approach.",
  "Results and Analysis": "We found that the graph encodings provided noticeableimprovements in most cases and consistently standardizedmodels performances between the NCAA and Professionalgames. In the baseline models, the models would consis-tently perform much better or worse on either the NCAAor Pro game for every task. This was due to differences inthe level of play and consistency between the NCAA andProfessional games in the dataset. For example, the base-line models were better at predicting rally outcomes and hittypes in the professional games because they are less randomand more deterministic given the better, more consistent, andmore mentally strong play by professional players; addition-ally the baseline models were better at predicting the setlocations because professional setters are more skilled andmake more randomized sets to confuse the opposing team.With the graph encodings, however, the difference in modelperformance between NCAA and Pro games was small ornegligible in almost all cases. This decrease in this perfor-mance gap is because the graph encoding makes the under-lying volleyball relationships between the data much moreclear to the models. In some tasks, these relationships aremore or less clear to the baseline models in NCAA or Pro-fessional play, but by manually explaining these relation-ships to the models, the relationships become equally clearand thus the models performances becomes more similar.For most cases, this improved understanding of the under-lying relationships between contacts in the game can boostperformance, and for otherswhere contact-by-contact in-formation may not be as useful or where models had diffi-culty analyzing the additional informationit struggled toimprove performance.Next we present an in depth analysis of each tasks results.",
  "Rally Outcome Prediction Results": "Overall, the use of our graph encodings and GNNs yieldedsignificant improvements for the rally outcome predictiontask as shown in below. GCN and Graph GRU bothyielded huge improvements for both the NCAA and Pro test-ing games over baseline in all metrics but brier score. GraphTransformer yielded a large improvement in NCAA gameperformance and a slight but noticeable boost in Pro gameperformance in all metrics except for brier score (which per-formed slightly better in the Pro game and slightly worsein the NCAA game). These improvements suggest that thegraph encoding gives the model a much more detailed pic-ture of what is happening in the rally allowing for moredetailedand thus better performingpredictions. Since aTransformer does an excellent job at analyzing the relation-ships between different variables with its attention mecha-nism, it does not benefit as much from the graph encod-ing. The Graph Transformer did perform noticeably betteron the NCAA game, however, so this again suggests that thelower level of play in the NCAA game made it harder to findthese underlying relationships as compared to the Pro game,but the graph encoding was able to make these relationshipsmore clear and thus standardized performance between thetwo levels of play. : rally outcome prediction task performance of each model on college-level games & professional games. There aresignificant improvements among all three models compared to the baseline performance. The Graph Transformer gives the bestresult.",
  "* model prediction results from VREN(Xia et al. 2022)": "The set location prediction task saw noticeable improve-ments when using our graph encoding as shown in .Not only did a base CNN perform better than the base-line Transformer (the only model tested in VREN(Xia et al.2022)), but the GCN improved upon the CNNs performanceeven further. Additionally the Graph Transformer saw a sim-ilar performance boost over the baseline Transformer. Withour addition of the baseline CNN and the improved perfor-mance with the graph encodings, we found a much betterunderstanding of what information goes into a setters deci-sion to set the ball. First, given the fact that setters try to be asrandom as they can be when making set location predictions,a simpler model seems to do better. The simple CNN modelgives a 2-3% performance boost over the baseline Trans-former, which is pretty noticeable in a hard to predict task,and GCN yields a similar performance boost over GraphTransformer. Secondly, it seems that the graph encoding andadditional information from the previous round does helpimprove set prediction performance, but the improvement isnot as significant as the previous task. This result, combinedwith the better performance of the convolution models over the transformer models, would suggest that the location asetter will set to depends less on contact-by-contact infor-mation than the outcome of the rally. Instead, the location asetter will set to likely depends more on simpler information(such as setters location on the court, pass rating, etc), whichwould allow a simpler convolution model to extract this in-formation better. Additionally, this theory would match upwith volleyball experts opinions on what influences the setlocation during a rally. Lastly, there is likely other useful in-formation for predicting where a setter will set the ball thatis not included in this dataset, such as how rushed the setteris and how high the pass is.",
  "Hit Type Prediction Results": "For the hit prediction task, the graph encodings and addi-tional information from the previous round yielded mixedresults but for the most part not much change as shown in. The graph encoding noticeably improved the per-formance of the Graph Transformer over the baseline forthe NCAA games and was relatively the same for the Progames, and the GCN performed slightly worse than base-line CNN for both sets of games. These results would sug-gest that the encoded contact-by-contact information is notas important for this task; the additional information mayslightly improve models that can use this information wellsuch as a Transformerbut may harm simpler models thatcannot analyze this information as well. Overall this wouldpoint to the location a hitter hits to being heavily influ-enced by individual variables, but with some small influ-ence from other contact-by-contact information. When in-cluding the blocked hit type, the simpler base CNN modeloutperformed the baseline Transformer model, but whenthis hit type is excluded they performed identically. Thiswould suggest that a player getting blocked may dependmore heavily on simple information (such as the locationof the hitter or number of blockers), but the hit type a hitterchooses to use may depend slightly more on the contact-by-contact information. Additionally, removing the blocked : Categorical Accuracy for hit type prediction task inboth NCAA and Professional games with blocked hits in-cluded vs excluded from training and testing. Graph Trans-former improved on or gave consistent results with baselinein all cases, while GCN performed slightly worse than base-line in all cases",
  "Analysis": "From these results, we can gather that predictions for out-comes that are largely influenced by contact-level informa-tion (like the rally outcome) will largely benefit from usinga graph encoding to bolster the contact-level information in-putted into a model. And similarly, outcomes that dependon contact-level information less (like the type of hit a hit-ter uses) will benefit less or see mixed results. Additionally,the use of our graph encoding allows the models to ana-lyze the game in a much more advanced and human way.The baseline models view the variables in the round glob-ally and then they try to analyze the connections betweenthem. This is similar to how a beginner of the sport wouldview a volleyball game: they view a whole round and un-derstand general connections between big events that factorinto certain outcomelike which team wins the rally. Totruly understand the flow of a rally, however, its more im-portant to look at how consecutive contacts are influencingeach other. For example, its more important to understandhow serving to a certain player may affect the rating andlocation of the pass, which may limit the players a settercan set to, which can significantly decrease a teams chanceof winning that rally. This sort of analysis is already usedby coaches, analysts, and fans who are more knowledge-able of the sport to evaluate how a game is going and howto change strategy to improve. GNNs primarily focus their analysis on graph edges, and in our encoding specificallythis is the relationships between consecutive contacts. Thusthe use of GNNs with our graph encodings yields a muchmore advanced analysis of the data which noticeably im-proved our results overall. Another takeaway is that thesebaseline tasks can be significantly improvedboth in pre-diction ability and in tactical usefulnesswith simple ad-justments. Removing blocked hits greatly improved predic-tion results at the same time as making the predictions moretactically focused and applicable. Conclusion and Future WorkIn this paper, we introduce a novel graph encoding to add ad-ditional contact-by-contact volleyball context to an alreadyavailable volleyball dataset without any additional data gath-ering. This graph encoding can yield large improvements inprediction tasks that depend heavily on this information, butmay not yield much benefit for tasks that do not. Ultimately,encodings are specialized tools that will not work in all situ-ations. Overall these results show the potential strengths andweaknesses of using graph encodings in sports data analyticsand hopefully will inspire future improvements in machinelearning strategies across sports and applications by usinggraph based encodings. Additionally, we demonstrate theimportance of choosing a model architecture that will bet-ter extract the important information for a certain taskinsome sports analysis tasks a much simpler model will per-form noticeably better on the given data. Lastly, we werealso able to gain a much better understanding of the under-lying relationships in a volleyball rally from these results;for a coach or player, this is extremely useful for makingmore informed game decisions.In future studies, we hope to gather more sophisticateddata than included in the dataset we explored in this studyand analyze other encoding formats to see if that can im-prove prediction results.
