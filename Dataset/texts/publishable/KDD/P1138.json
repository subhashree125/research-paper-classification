  "ABSTRACT": "Mobile health programs are becoming an increasingly popular mediumfor dissemination of health information among beneficiaries in lessprivileged communities. Kilkari is one of the worlds largest mobilehealth programs which delivers time sensitive audio-messages topregnant women and new mothers. We have been collaborating withARMMAN, a non-profit in India which operates the Kilkari program,to identify bottlenecks to improve the efficiency of the program. Inparticular, we provide an initial analysis of the trajectories of benefi-ciaries interaction with the mHealth program and examine elementsof the program that can be potentially enhanced to boost its success.We cluster the cohort into different buckets based on listenershipso as to analyze listenership patterns for each group that could helpboost program success . We also demonstrate preliminary results onusing historical data in a time-series prediction to identify benefi-ciary dropouts and enable NGOs in devising timely interventions tostrengthen beneficiary retention.",

They play a key role in making healthcare more accessiblefor the less privileged .In this paper, we focus on our collaboration with ARMMAN, an India-based non-profit organization which conducts mHealthprograms in India to increase awareness during antenatal and postpar-tum care for pregnant women and mothers. It has adopted mHealthinterventions to assist in bringing down maternal and child mor-tality rates. mMitra, an initiative by ARMMAN, is a free mobilecall service that delivers organized preventive care information toenrolled women throughout their pregnancy and child infancy, on aweekly/bi-weekly basis. mMitra has successfully deployed SAHELI, a system to efficiently utilize the limited capacity of healthcareresources to boost engagement with the program.In 2016, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW)launched the Kilkari program, a free mobile health (mHealth) educa-tion service that sends women preventive care information duringpregnancy and child infancy. Kilkari is an IVR service designedto deliver weekly pre-recorded, stage-specific audio messages topregnant women and mothers with children under the age of 1 year.Currently operational in 18 states and Union Terriroties, Kilkari hasreached over 30 million women and their children to date, and has3 million active subscribers. ARMMAN is a technical, content &creative production, and implementation partner to the MoHFW inmaking Kilkari available pan-India.Like most mHealth programs , Kilkari continues to evolvewith improvements in technology and infrastructure. We discusssome unexplored questions based on these new developments inKilkari. Our key contributions are : Analyzing listenership patterns of different beneficiarybuckets: We segment our cohort of beneficiaries into fourbuckets based on listenership (High Pickup Rate - High En-gagement Rate, High Pickup Rate - Low Engagement Rate,Low Pickup Rate - High Engagement Rate, Low Pickup Rate -Low Engagement Rate ) and analyse each bucket individually.",
  "KDD 23, August 0610, 2023, Longbeach, CALalan et al": "This segmentation helps us analyze the problem of listener-ship using two metrics - pickup and engagement - which weshow are equally important. While previous works have onlyused pickup rates as an indication of listenership, we showthat high pickup rates could be coupled with low engagementrates and thus should be taken into account to bolster programsuccess. Analyzing the impact of time slot on call pickup and callengagement: For our analysis, we construct seven time slotsin the interval from 8 AM to 10 PM, divided into two-hourintervals. All calls, including reattempts, are put into oneof these time slots. Our findings show that the beneficiariesin different buckets tend to exhibit a preference for sometime slots over the others, which can be useful in boostinglistenership Predicting low-listeners: Our final contribution is predictingengagement rates (the rate at which beneficiary listens to acall for more than 30 seconds) along with pickup rates (therate at which beneficiary picks up calls) of the entire cohortusing preliminary time-series modelling. We showcase howto make such predictions using only listenership trajectoriesand no demographic features, which can be useful in pro-grams with sensitive and limited beneficiary information, akey characteristic of most mHealth programs. Additionally,predicting low-listenership of beneficiaries from historicaldata can assist NGOs in planning timely interventions toimprove beneficiary retention.",
  "RELATED WORKS AND BACKGROUND": "Adherence monitoring in healthcare is an extensively studied prob-lem for diseases like HIV , cardiac problems , Tuberculosis, etc. In mobile health programs as well, techniques suchas sequential modelling and markov decision process models have been used to improve beneficiaries adherence to audiomessages.Kilkari is the largest maternal mHealth messaging program inthe world . Given the scale of Kilkaris outreach, it has been asubject of multiple research studies in the past . Infrastructuraland technological investments have led to the successful resolutionof some of the key challenges discussed in previous works, whileothers have become less significant in the course of time. address the process of scaling Kilkari successfully across ge-ographies. At scale, Kilkari was redesigned to make calls throughoutthe day as opposed to based on subscriber preference to increasecost-efficiency. An unintentional consequence was that sometimescalls were made at times that could prove unsuitable to beneficia-ries. also highlight certain considerations that need to be takeninto account in achieving success at scale among the rural population,such as sim churn and gender gap in mobile phone access and digitalliteracy. investigate the impact of variations in phone ownershiplevels among different social strata, such as income and education.The paper highlights that a successfully picked call may not guar-antee that it was answered by the intended recipient, as it may have been answered by another unaware family member. Consequently,it would be beneficial to analyse call engagement (duration of calllistened to) in conjunction with pickup rate to measure the outcomeof the program, as opposed to analysing pickup rates exclusively.Our work represents the first attempt in predicting both pickup ratesand engagement rates for program beneficiaries.The key contribution of this paper centers around the challengesthat Kilkari faces presently, in particular emphasizing predicting andcontacting beneficiaries in their preferred time slots, as well as priori-tizing program engagement rates along with pickup rates. Finally, weuse predictive time-series modelling to predict engagement rates andpickup rates of the cohort. also uses a predictive model for lowlistenership prediction. However, our work uses both engagementand call pickup as metrics for low listenership, which our secondaryanalysis from bucketing beneficiaries shows are equally importantmetrics. We thus learn separate binary classification models for boththese target variables. Moreover, our secondary analysis also un-derscores factors such as time slot of placing calls and technicalsuccess rate of calls which can be important for boosting pickup andengagement rates for the low listener groups, which has not beenhighlighted by .",
  "PROBLEM FORMULATION3.1Data Description": "The Kilkari mobile health program is an outbound service that makesperiodic automated voice calls to pregnant women and new mothers,starting from the second trimester of pregnancy until the time thechild is one year old. One voice message is scheduled for everybeneficiary in each of these 72 weeks, which contains informationon topics such as maternal and child health, immunization and familyplanning.Each beneficiary receives a maximum of 9 call attempts over 4days, until they pick up the phone to increase the probability of thempicking up the call. For every call attempt, the time and day of theattempt as well as the technical status is noted in the call recordsdatabase. The technical status gives information on whether the callwas picked up or the line was busy, switched off or out of networkcoverage.In our analysis, we consider beneficiaries enrolled in the Kilkariprogram in the Indian state of Orissa between the year 2020-2022.Particularly, we take the set of 240K beneficiaries registered in Orissaand who received a call in the first week of 2022. We then create adataset of their call history trajectory containing information on callattempts number, date and time of call, gestational age of beneficiaryat the time of call, technical status of call and duration of the call.",
  "Time Slot Analysis": "Every week, a beneficiary receives the first call attempt on the sameday as the day of their Last Menstrual Period date. If the beneficiarydoesnt pick up the call, the call is attempted again.However, the time of receiving a call in a day is currently ran-domized. In our analysis, we demonstrate the value in predictingand utilizing a favourable time slot for beneficiaries.",
  "(1) low-pickup rate: beneficiaries who have picked up less than 3calls within a 6 week time window": "(2) low-engagement rate: beneficiaries who have engaged with acall less than 3 times within a 6 week time window. Engage-ment is defined as listening to a call for more than 30 seconds(average message length is typically around 90 seconds). Based on these definitions, we consider the following problem:Can a prediction be made in advance on when a beneficiary willbecome a low-listener. In such a case, early intervention by the NGOcan help keep beneficiaries engaged with the health-informationcalls in the long run.This low-listenership prediction problem can be formulated asa time-series prediction task. Starting at some point in time, weuse history of beneficiaries listenership trajectory for weeks to predict low-listenership weeks in the future. Toconvert the raw dataset described previously for the time seriesprediction task, we split listenership trajectory of all beneficiariesinto multiple rolling windows. Specifically, each window is of length + + 6 weeks where the last 6 weeks are usedfor defining the low-listenership binary flag. For each beneficiary,we create time series of duration of calls every week, number ofattempts, status of calls, and the date and time of calls. Given thesetemporal features, we try to predict whether a beneficiary would havelow-listenership. Note that beneficiaries enter and exit the Kilkariprogram at different points in time. Thus, we would get differentnumber of time-windows for different beneficiaries.Finally, we split the beneficiaries into train (80%) and test (20%)sets, and thus create the train and test time series datasets. Splittingon beneficiaries rather than temporally allows us to learn a predictionmodel that can predict low-listenership for new beneficiaries whichenter the system and have at least weeks of call history.",
  "EXPERIMENTS4.1Measuring efficacy of each successive attempt": "The IVR System makes a maximum of 9 attempts to a beneficiaryin a week. shows the percentage of beneficiaries reached witheach successive attempt. The magnitude of the bars indicates theeffectiveness of an attempt in reaching beneficiaries. We see a steadydecrease in the percentage of beneficiaries that are reached witheach successive attempt. The blue line indicates the cumulativepercentage of beneficiaries reached. It can be seen that on average,23% beneficiaries are not reached despite 9 attempts. Given the scaleof the program, this is a significant number.",
  "Analysing Listenership Patterns of Beneficiarybuckets": "Based on call pickup and call engagement behaviour, the benefi-ciaries were divided into four buckets: High Pickup Rate - HighEngagement Rate, High Pickup Rate - Low Engagement Rate, LowPickup Rate - High Engagement Rate, Low Pickup Rate - LowEngagement Rate. To avoid noisy patterns caused due to ad hoc Number of Retry Attempts Percentage (%) of beneficiaries reached Percentage of beneficiaries reached in a week cumulativeper attemptAvg percentage of unreached beneficiaries = 23%",
  ": Distribution of beneficiary in each bucket": "listenership, two extreme set of beneficiaries were picked from theoriginal data - those that have a high listening trajectory of greaterthan 50 weeks and those who have a lower listening trajectory ofless than 20 weeks. These sets were constructed for the purposeof preliminary analysis, and we plan to expand them further in thefuture to include more beneficiaries. The previously mentioned fourbuckets were then constructed from the union of these two sets ofbeneficiaries. The distribution of beneficiaries per bucket is as per.Three major conclusions can be drawn from the analysis:",
  "Technical failures reduce pickup rates and could potentiallylead to dropouts": "Some external factors could also affect beneficiary pick up ratesand engagement. For example, there was an observed decrease inlistenership of specific beneficiaries during the New Year period,which could be a possible phenomenon during most major festivities. illustrates this for one beneficiary. The first graph indicateswhich attempt day the call was picked on. The red hashed barsindicate weeks when the call was not picked up. The second plotshows whether the beneficiary engaged with the call (green bar) ornot (red bar). Finally, the last graph indicates the week of the year ateach Kilkari message index. We see the period of new years starts",
  ": Listenership pattern of a beneficiary around new year- the red hashed bars indicate that the beneficiary did not pickup calls around new years": "For figures 3, 4, 5 and 6, the six graphs display various charac-teristics of these aggregate groups. The first left graph shows theaverage pickup rate. The first right graph shows on average, whatattempt day did the beneficiaries pick up the call in (blue if attemptday 1, green if attempt day 2, brown if attempt day 3, red ifattempt day 4). The second left graph indicates the average tech-nical success ratio (a green dot indicates a technical success ratiogreater than 0.5, a red dot will indicate otherwise). The second rightgraph indicates which time slot did most of the beneficiaries pickup in out of the 7 time slots . Time Slot 0 is the earliest time slot(8AM-10PM) and Time Slot 6 is the latest (8PM-10PM) The thirdleft graph indicates the call duration on average for every messageindex (red i.e non-engaging if call duration <= 30.0 seconds elsegreen i.e engaging). The third right graph indicates which day ofthe week did most of the beneficiaries pick up in. Day 0 indicates aMonday and Day 6 a Sunday. The color-coded scatter plots of timeslot and day of the week are for easy visualisation of which pointsare in abundance. 4.2.1Bucket 1: High Pickup Rate - High Engagement Ratebeneficiaries. On average, this group of beneficiaries () pickedup the call on the first attempt day. The average technical successrate for these beneficiaries was extremely high, around 90%. Thus,high pickup rates seem to be indicative of a good technical successratio. Most of these beneficiaries seem to pick up across diverse calltime slots, with a slight preference for time slot 5 (6 PM to 8 PM). 4.2.2Bucket 2: High Pickup Rate - Low Engagement Ratebeneficiaries. The second bucket () comprises of beneficiariesthat highlight one of the key focus points of this paper - engagementin the program is a better metric than pickup rates to measureprogram success. Despite a high average technical success rate, theengagement in the program remains low. While a predictive modelfor pickup rates will prefer this set of beneficiaries over beneficiaries 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59",
  ": Listenership patterns of beneficiaries with high pickup rates and low listenership": "4.2.3Bucket 3: Low Pickup Rate - High Engagement Ratebeneficiaries. The third bucket () of beneficiaries tends tohighly engage with the program, despite lower pickup rates. A possi-ble reason for lower pick up rates could be the low average technicalsuccess rates of calls. These beneficiaries also display a strong pref-erence for the morning and evening slots, with most calls beingpicked up during the first two and last two slots of the day. Thus,providing a higher number of attempts to address technical failuresand rearranging calls for beneficiaries in this bucket for early or latein the day can potentially improve their performance in the program. 4.2.4Bucket 4: Low Pickup Rate - Low Engagement Ratebeneficiaries. The average technical success rate for these benefi-ciaries () is the lowest out of all the buckets, and is a meager20%. This indicates that most calls made to these beneficiaries donot go through. This could be contributory to their low pickup rates.Finally, the beneficiaries also show a preference for the first and lasttime slots of the day. Addressing the correct time slots to place calls,driving engagement for calls that do connect despite lower pick up",
  "Technical Failures and pick up rates": "Certain beneficiaries are more susceptible to technical failures thanothers, which can affect their pickup rates and might eventuallylead to them getting dropped out of the program. Dropouts are cru-cial in Kilkari as they save resources for the program by avoidingunnecessary attempts to phone numbers that are no longer in ser-vice, or to people who were incorrectly registered in the program.However, an unintended effect may be the possibility of dropouts inpoor network coverage areas. While such issues can be addressed indue course with improvements in network coverage, it is critical tomake multiple attempts to ensure maximum beneficiaries can receivetechnically successful calls. shows the listening trajectory of a beneficiary who picksup all the calls. The first graph shows the attempt day on which thecall was picked (blue if attempt day = 1, green if attempt day= 2, maroon if attempt day = 3, red if attempt day = 4). Thesecond graph shows the engagement of the beneficiary every week(green bar implies engaging and red bar implies non-engaging). The red hashed bars in both the graphs indicate calls that havent beenpicked up. Finally, the final graph plots Boolean values of whetherthe beneficiary received technically successful (green) and failed(red) calls. Weeks with only red dots indicate that no technicallysuccessful calls were made that week.We see that the beneficiary loses up to 5 weeks of messagesdue to a series of technical failures. It is interesting to note thatafter 6 weeks of no listenership, beneficiaries are dropped fromthe program.Kilkari has the flexibility of increasing the number ofattempt days that beneficiaries are contacted over, hence identifyingthe segment of beneficiaries prone to technical failures and reachingthem over a greater number of attempts can help further boost pickuprates in the program.",
  "Analysis of time slot on listener pickup andengagement rates": "Currently, calls in Kilkari are made at random times during the day.For analysis, we have constructed seven time slots in the intervalfrom 8 AM to 10 PM, divided into two-hour intervals. Calling ben-eficiaries in their preferred time slot can help in increasing pickupand engagement rates. As seen in , there is a clear preference inthe total cohort for morning time slots, which boasts of the highestpickup rates. However, for beneficiaries with low pickup rates andlow engagement, all slots perform equally poorly with the exceptionof the first and last time slot (). As discussed previously, onepossible reason is the issue of phone ownership, where the benefi-ciary has access to the phone in only the earlier or later parts of theday. Currently, there are plans to update the IVR infrastructure toallow for maximum outreach. While bandwidth will no longer be anissue in the newer version of the IVR system, concurrency of callsstill acts as a bottleneck. Thus, it might not be possible to call allbeneficiaries in the morning or evening slots and leave the remainingslots with no bandwidth utilization. We aim to build a predictivemodel to calculate the top-k preferred time slots of beneficiaries,",
  "Predicting low-listeners": "To segment beneficiaries into different clusters and to help NGOsplan for timely interventions that can increase program retention,we make use of beneficiaries historical trajectories in a time-seriesmodel to predict low pickup rates and low engagement rates. Ourmodel does not make use of any beneficiary demographic features,and is thus especially relevant for mHealth programs, where benefi-cary information is often sensitive and limited.We use the dataset described in .3 to predict whetherbeneficiaries would showcase low-listenership behaviour in the fu-ture. Specifically, we consider two definitions of low-listenership,low-pickup and low engagement. We thus learn separate binaryclassification models for these two target variables. As input, weconsider = 6 weeks of listenership indicators. This includes time series of duration of calls listened to every week, number ofcall attempts every week and number of calls with every status codesevery week. We consider the following status codes that is loggedin the Kilkari system: call picked up, phone busy, phone switchedoff, phone out of network, any other reason of not reaching. Thisresults in a total of 7 features every week. Crucially, we developpredictive models which only use listenership behaviour data and nobeneficiary specific information.We consider the following models in our experiments:",
  "Logistic Regression: This uses a logistic regression model topredict the target variable. Time series features are flattenedand given as input to the model": "Feedforward NN: This uses a dense feedforward neural net-work. We use 3 layers with 128 hidden units each and finallya sigmoid acitvation for output. Binary crossentropy loss isused to optimise the weights of the neural network. Thismodel also uses flattened time series as input. LSTM: We use Keras implementation of Long Short TermMemory model for encoding sequential information frombeneficiaires listenership. Specifically, we use LSTM cellwith 128 hidden units followed by three layers of 128 hiddenunits each. Finally, we use sigmoid activation for output. andBinary crossentropy loss as optimization objective.We evaluate all models on three metrics: Precision@K%: This is the precision in predicting low-listenership flag if we set threshold to (100 )th percentileof values. This measures the fraction of low-listeners that wewill find if top % of beneficiaires are chosen according tomodel predictions. Since health resources are limited, we use( = 5%) in our experiments.",
  "Balanced Accuracy: Since we have imbalanced target dis-tribution, we extend the notion of accuracy to imbalancedclasses. Balanced accuracy is the arithmetic mean of sensitiv-ity and specificity": "AUC: We also report the area under the ROC curve (AUC)metric to compare all the models.In table 2 and table 3, we compare different models on multipleevaluation metrics for low-engagement and low-pickup targets re-spectively. We notice for both the targets, ML models can performmuch better than random. This showcases that input features arepredictive of low listenership. However, we do not see any addedvalue from time series model like LSTM, as opposed to logistic re-gression or feedforward neural network. Lastly, we find that addingadditional features, such as status of calls and attempts results inslight increase in predictive performance.",
  "ETHICS AND DATA USAGE": "Acknowledging the responsibility associated with real-world AI sys-tems for undeserved communities, we have closely coordinated withdomain experts from the NGO throughout our analysis. This studyfalls into the category of secondary analysis of the aforementioneddataset. We use the previously collected engagement trajectories ofdifferent beneficiaries participating in the service call program totrain the predictive model and evaluate the performance. All the data",
  "CONCLUSION": "In this preliminary work, we perform secondary data analysis forKilkari, the largest maternal mobile health program in the world.We characterize beneficiaries engagement and pickup behaviourwith the program through their temporal patterns in voice messagelistenership. We showcase that apart from beneficiaries call pickuprates, which has been the primary focus of several previous works,call engagement rates, preferred time slots and good call technicalsuccess ratios are also critical for successful outreach of the program.Lastly, we demonstrate that historical data can be used to predictlow-listenership of beneficiaries to provide tailored approaches forbeneficiary clusters and help NGOs perform timely intervention toincrease beneficiary retention. Our proposed modelling approachrelies only on past listenership trajectories, thus removing depen-dence on any sensitive or limited beneficiary information. Theseresults also open up new line of ML research in areas such as fea-ture engineering, intervention optimization and measuring behaviourchange with better access to information such as voice messages.Our analysis and techniques can be extended to other large-scalemHealth programs.
