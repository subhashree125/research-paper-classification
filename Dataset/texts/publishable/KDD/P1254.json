  "ABSTRACT": "The transactions of goods and services between large businessesare often driven by purchase order (PO). A PO is a document thatwhich details the sale of products and services to be delivered. Thisis also true for the cloud service providers with added complex-ity of managing the dynamic billing for services, and invoicingagainst the purchase order. The demand driven usage of the cloudinfrastructure and services can lead to unpredictable nature of costwhich can lead to the invoices that may get into a dispute due toPO amount getting exhausted much ahead of the contract end date.One needs to keep tab on all such POs so that cash flow does notget impacted due to such dispute. In large enterprise with largenumber of POs, managing the billing against the PO becomes largeundertaking along with increased cost. There is a need for a POdispute management system that can proactively identify potentialdispute in timely manner and provide guided service to the workersmanaging such PO.To address this challenge, we developed a risk analytics modelalong with a recommendation engine, enhanced with human-in-the-loop to rank purchase orders for renewal. The risk analytics modeluses historical billing patterns of clients, together with purchaseorders and services usage details, and performs risk analysis onpotential disputes. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methodby showing implementation of the application. The results fromour deployed application are encouraging that it can help reducebilling disputes by proactively examining high-risk cases and takingactions.",

  "INTRODUCTION": "Information Technology (IT) service providers sell highly-valuedservices to numerous enterprise clients every year. Such servicesare often agreed and fulfilled through contracts and purchase orders(PO). A PO is an official document that buyers send to sellers todocument the sale of products and services to be delivered at a latedate. Each PO has its own unique number, known as the purchaseorder number, to assist both buyer and seller in tracking deliveryand payment. .A PO typically involves composite services such as SaaS (Soft-ware as a Service), ESW (Entitled Software Systems), Cloud Services,Project based services, Hardware services and IT applications man-agement which consists of several thousands of technical hardware,software, services, and labor components . There are many com-plexities tied to a contract that can be described into a PO, whichdetails the services sold, time duration for providing them, base costfor setup and subscription, renewal details, billing frequency, etc.Invoices are created and billed with respect to a PO. The demanddriven usage of services can lead to challenges in forecasting theirusage in the future. If the usage of services crosses a threshold, itcan lead to disputes with the customers.It is not uncommon that a contract is handled via multiple POsover time. When a PO expires or exhausts its amount, the customerclient needs to determine whether to renew the PO, and handle sub-sequent billing and disputes in a timely manner, because chargingclients after PO has expired can be challenging as clients may nolonger accept new invoices. Proper renewal of POs on time helpsin lowering billing disputes and ensuring continued services to thecustomer client. While the process described here is a simplifiedone, it should illustrate a need to track the usage of services andPO amount left before renewal, and identify potential disputes andrenew POs on time in order to avoid time-consuming handlingof financial and legal issues. In our observations, however, manyorganizations are suffering inefficiency.",
  ", ,Shubhi, et al": "Let us elaborate on the challenges associated with this issue.First, while the business practice using POs is common, it is notmandatory in every transaction for all customer clients, so thereare transactions that use POs and those that dont. As a result, thefinancial system handling the entire process tends to be fragmented,with management of POs often not fully integrated.Second, modern IT services, such as cloud services, follow demand-driven usage of services, which may not be uniform due to changesin demand of services for varied reasons. This makes determin-ing usage in the future difficult, leading to disputes or risks ofexhausting the planned PO amount. It also makes a straightforwardauto-renewal of POs not viable as the situation varies by everycontract.Third, every year service providers may process thousands ofPOs. They typically have few human resources to maintain/monitorthem manually. In one statics we obtained, more than one fourthof these POs run into dispute, causing risk to the cash flow. Thechallenge faced by service providers, therefore, is that it takes alot of time for teams to manually process each PO and identify theones that requires renewal, or they may risk exhausting the POs.Every year, tens of thousand of POs enter dispute due to inabilityof identifying high risk POs.In the current state of the art, there have been a few solutionstargeted towards a cognitive approach for handling the PO data.These solutions include building a data visualization dashboardfor purchase order flow with various alert systems . An-other solution involves looking at high-value POs or POs withenterprise customers. However, there are no significant machinelearning models that are transforming this process by strategizingthe billing process based on client usage. Also there are studiesdone to explore subscription renewal intention of operational cloudenterprise systems . The key here is to utilize the features ofthe PO along with customer data, market demands and historicalusage to identify the high-risk POs that require urgent attentionand would have successful renewal of POs.We present a novel application in the area of finances in servicesindustry where we developed a risk analytics application for re-newal of POs. Our proposed methodology comprises of three keysteps:",
  "(1) Data exploration and formulate the risk analytics model(2) Perform time series prediction on usage pattern(3) Recommendation system for PO renewal strategy": "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in , wegive an overview of the PO lifecycle to help understand the renewalprocess, and in , we review the related work. In ,we illustrate our methodology in detail then we provide an imple-mentation and results in . We then provide the conclusionsand directions for future work in .",
  "PURCHASE ORDER (PO) LIFECYCLEMANAGEMENT": "In this section, we describe the Purchase Order (PO) lifecycle pro-cess. shows a high level process diagram of the PO lifecycle.Let us suppose that a cloud service provider sells multiple ser-vices via PO to numerous clients every year. There are many detailsof these services that are iterated and finalized over time such as the details of the services, time duration for providing them, basecost for setup and subscription, renewal contract details, billingfrequency, etc. These details of the PO finalized as well for whichservice providers would provide is listed in a signed document.This document details the range of dates between which theservices would be offered, the customer contact, and the amountvalue of the services that would be utilized. It also specifies thebilling frequency of the purchase, whether annual, one time pur-chase, monthly etc. The PO database contains the POs done in pastfew years.Now, the customers are billed invoices based on the billing fre-quency set by the customer. The invoice data, obtained from in-voices database, shows the details of invoiced amount, invoice date,etc. The invoices can also be towards overages, which are the over-utilisation of services than what was planned by the customer. Thedata regarding contract details, actual usage of the services andinvoices billed are scattered across different systems.A case-by-case review is performed for each PO, estimatingmanually the usage of services and checking routinely whethertotal invoiced amount would exceed the amount decided at thesigning of contract. If the amount exceeds, the customer would getinto dispute with the provider and negotiate for the excess usageof services. A dispute occurs when a customer over-utilises (andhence overbilled) more than the initial contract amount decided atthe start of the contract. This negotiation typically involves manualreviews by finance teams.In this, the account executives use the customer profiles theprobability of renewal of POs manually. The POs that run a risk ofdispute are notified to the finance team to take appropriate action.Even with an easy-to-use dashboard, the intricacies of POs,invoices, service usage details are a lot of information to be trackedmanually through data visualization. Sophisticated methods arerequired to streamline the process and show the risk analysis andrenewal probability for each PO.",
  "RELATED WORK": "In this section, we present the state of the art in risk analytics andrenewal of purchase orders as follows. There are prior studies thatpresent approaches for the forecasting demand of services, predictrenewal of contracts or purchase orders, and perform risk analytics.Turkmen et. al. in proposes a new, unified framework forbuilding intermittent demand forecast models. Chandrasekar andVivek in describe a method for producing optimal purchaseschedules, so as to ensure lowest cost purchase plan. Sinem et al.in focused on a method to predict contract renewal ahead ofcontract expiration, using comments and interview transcripts bysentiment analysis program that generates sentiments.Our method differentiates from these priors works in a numberof ways. Turkmen et. al. in connects IDF models to discrete-time renewal processes, yielding a flexible framework for buildingstochastic models of intermittent time series, whereas our methodfocuses on using historical purchase order history to build therisk analytics model with time series. focuses on consider-ing contractual details to generate intelligent recommendation tominimize the cost, and better manage the cash flow by providing",
  ": High Level process execution of the PO lifecycle": "future visibility through the planning horizon. In contract, our rec-ommendation system uses PO details, along with market trendsand customer purchase history to consider risk in renewal. uses sentiment analysis and historical renewal and growth data togenerate a contract renewal and growth prediction model, whileour method uses structured PO data along with usage and invoicesto build the recommendation system.Current state of the art in demand forecasting has advanced asit includes multiple factors influencing the renewal of contracts,especially in supply chain. In , Gerard and Martin share a studyof contracts that allows the supply chain to share demand fore-casts under compliance engine, so that they can share the criticalchanges in demand. Hongyan in studies a two-stage purchasecontract with a demand forecast update. Here the authors useddynamic programming formulation to get insights in whether toallocate efforts in improving forecast quality and whether to signthe contract or not. Similarly, Pan et. al. in shows an analysisthat if the service efficiency is high, the retailer should voluntarilynot share its demand forecast. Here the authors study further intoinvestigating whether either manufacturer or the retailer conductdemand-enhancing service.Prior work has also looked at predicting and quantifying therisk in service contracts. For eg. in , Geraldine et al. provides aprediction model to predict risk factors affecting the new IT servicecontract and to quantify an impact of each predicted risk factor onan expected gross profit margin. In Laurens et al. contribute witha data-driven tariff plan based on the calibration of predictive mod-els that take into account the different profiles of services offered.Other example of building risk management for contract portfo-lio include building a new construct of profit-at-risk framework, building a risk and decision analysis framework for predictivemodelling and reporting risks associated with execution of strate-gic contracts , generating service contract renewal propensitybased on historical service contract information associated with theasset, determining a propensity of a consumer of the asset to renew a service contract between the consumer and a service provider.In the related work discussed above, there is a focus on identi-fying trends in usage of services, and not on customer portfolio,market and environment trends influencing the usage etc. Thisis where our risk analytics helps bridge the gap. We also observethat there is a focus on identifying demand forecast, and not goingfurther and analysing the chances in renewal of purchase order.This is the objective of this work.",
  "Overview of our method": "Our method is a three-step approach that aims at understanding therisk of PO getting into a dispute. illustrates our methodol-ogy. The inputs to our model are the customer details like the name,geography where we are catering service to, customer number, pastPOs of customer etc. The model also uses details of PO and ser-vice usage details like duration of PO, billing frequency, customerrepresentatives, PO amount etc.Other inputs include data of services usage by other customers,market trends, other POs by customers, etc. We process this datain our first step, ensuring data validation. Second, we build therisk analytics model for different POs. As part of building therisk analytics model, we forecast the invoiced amounts for nextfew billing cycles. In our third step, the recommendation systemcalibrates the PO duration and their renewal based on the usageand forecast of usage in next few billing cycles.The output is the list of POs along with recommendationswhether they are high-risk POs with high or low chance of re-newal. This output is enhanced with a human-in-the-loop whoanalyses these recommendations and provides the extra dimension-ality of external factors like market trends influencing the renewalof POs.",
  "In this section, we provide a detailed description of the three stepsof our approach as follows": "4.2.1Data exploration and processing. In the first step, the histor-ical POs and their invoice data are pulled with a processor fromdata lakes, clouds and other services to create a large structuredatabase. We take the features of PO including customer details, POduration, billing frequency, customer representative, whether PO isrenewed or new, customer profile (size, industry etc) and contractcontents. We also take in the past history of PO records of customer,conversation/meetings with customers. The customer data alongwith features like old PO records are also pulled up.The collected data is cleaned and normalized. The raw datais transformed into useful information for our purpose, e.g. POfeatures. Also the raw data is checked for errors which are deleted.These can include partial data, NaN, anomaly detection etc.One crucial observation here is that the billed invoices are notalways in the same system as POs. Hence the billed invoices needto be mapped to their corresponding POs. The PO and invoicefeatures are selected and tested to be included as regressors in therisk analytics model.The output of this step is the pre-processed PO and invoice datawhich is then fed into the risk analytics model in the next step. 4.2.2Risk analytics model. In the second step, we formulate therisk analytics model for different POs and compute the risk factor.We show the detailed approach for this below.A. Computing the risk factor: We take the PO features from thelast step which includes PO duration, initial amount, PO amountbilled till date etc. We also take time series invoice data and performrisk analysis after every billed invoice. The time series invoice datais trained using a time series model. Using the predictions from thetime series model, we can map the trend of invoices.The model looks at the trend of risk factors in the past few billingcycles and forecasts the trend in services usage and its correspond-ing billing amounts for the next few cycles. Here the risk factor atevery billing cycle, is calculated as follows:",
  "(Expected amount per invoice to be billed)": "For example, if PO amount initially was $1,000, and remainingPO amount left after the invoicing is $200, and expected amountper invoice to be billed is $100, then we calculate risk factor as 2.Intuitively, it represents how many future invoice cycles will takePO amount to exhaust. We formulate the risk level using (1) riskfactor and (2) expected number of pending invoices.Note that < 1 means the remaining PO amount cant coverthe next invoice expected. < (expected number of invoices left)means there will be a predicted dispute. Smaller indicates moreimmediate risks. Using expected billing amount per cycle, we canforecast the invoiced amount in next few cycles.B. Forecast invoices for next billing cycles: Ideally the PO durationis established at the start of the PO say for 1 year or 5 year contract.However changes in services usage may change the PO duration as customer may be out of funds sooner, or may have excess funds atthe end of contract. To avoid running out of PO funds, and ensuringcustomer renewal at correct time, we need to forecast the invoicesin next few billing cyclesThe sub steps to perform the above are as follows: We firstcalculate the current PO amount remaining for the customer. Thenwe use the trend invoices for last few billing cycles, and forecastinvoices for next few billing cycles. Using output of last step andand the PO amount remaining, we calculate the number of billingcycles for PO to get exhausted. Depending on the value of riskfactor and the number of billing cycles left for PO to get exhausted,we categorize the PO as overbilled, high, medium or low risk. 4.2.3Recommendation system for renewal of PO. In the final step,we propose the recommendation system that can evaluate the POrenewal.Since not all high or medium POs can be reviewed manually,we want to come up with their ranking to filter those require highattention. This is a complicated problem as one needs to knowwhether the PO would be renewed, even if it is high/medium/lowrisk, based on customer portfolio. The objective to rank the POsthat have higher likelihood of being renewed.In that case, we will include the following parameters and vari-ables: PO amount, PO amount exhausted/have potential to get intolarge dispute (Risk), Past customer POs and their renewal history,Customer portfolio (enterprise versus mid sized/ startup, industry,market trends), PO end date etc. Using these features, we use ouralgorithm to evaluate the likelihood of PO getting renewed.PO renewal likelihood = f(R, cust_portfolio, past_trend, po_end_date)Lastly, the human-in-the-loop helps analyse the PO renewal like-lihood. He can factor in the external factors that could influence thePO renewal, like market trends, offline interactions with the cus-tomer etc. Hence his analysis would influence the recommendationsystem and provide the final PO renewal likelihood. The simplemethodology of calculating risk factor and PO renewal likelihoodscore helps the human point out to discrepancies in the method-ology where important regressors may be missed out, or externalconditions may influence the renewal score.",
  "IMPLEMENTATION": "In this section, we describe the implementation of our method.Note that our objective here is to provide such implementationof our risk analytics and recommendation engine approach, withsome initial results of the tool when put in production. We startwith explaining our real-world application as follows: we built theDispute Elimination Through Analytics (DELTA) tool recently. Thetool provided risk insights on the POs and their invoices. The toolused real-world PO and invoice data from one of the worlds biggestIT service providers. The fields of the dataset and can be generalizedfor multiple service providers. Our objective here is to apply ourmethod for risk analytics on the active ongoing POs.Our tool was developed for users in multiple geographies toprovide more indicative forecasting of usage of services. Since theapplication uses confidential data, we cannot share raw data details.However we will describe the key characteristics of the data andhow the implementation was performed.",
  "Evaluation setup": "For our experiment, we selected a set of 3900 Purchase Orders fromthe aforementioned repository which included POs between year2018 and 2020. We analyzed the invoices for these POs, which intotal were more than a million records. We developed a repository ofreal-world PO data and mapped them to the corresponding invoicesusing a combination of features - PO number, contract numberand customer number. The chosen POs contained all the requiredstructured PO features data, along with some unstructured data.The feature selection in the PO dataset ensured that we prepro-cessed the features of PO, customer information and the invoicesbilled to them. Below in , we show the snapshot of themapping done between the PO and invoice datasets, along withindividual billed items in each invoice. We divided our evaluationinto two main parts. In the first part, we build a time series fore-casting model for predicting the usage of services in the future fewbilling cycles. In the second part, we use the risk analytics model toanalyse and recommend the PO renewal likelihood with high cashflow. We now provide our results for each of the two parts.For each PO, we extract and use its meta data for our modelfeatures. These data are: PO amount, amount remaining, PO start",
  ": Sample output of actual versus predicted invoicesamount": "date, PO end date, PO renewal lead time, billing frequency. We mapeach of these POs to their corresponding invoices based on POnumber, customer number and contract number. The data of POincludes invoice data, invoice amount, items in the invoice, kind ofinvoice etc. These are the attributes chosen by feature selection thatare most indicative while predicting future usage of services andamount that may be billed. In spite of fixed PO amount, the usageof services may not remain same and hence the actual amount ofeach invoice is not fixed.While PO may define billing frequency and billing plan, which inturn defines total number of invoices that should ideally be charged,and when each invoice would be charged, there are uncertaintyfactors for both business aspects and technical aspects that mayleave this prediction complex in nature. Here the uncertainty factorscould be change in market trend in usage of services, over or underuse of services by customers, sometimes leading to overages etc.The dataset has been modeled on Prophet time series modelsevaluated for accuracy in predictions. It was trained on regres-sors like geography, items in the invoice, customer portfolio andmonthly, quarterly seasonality trends were added to the observa-tions. The evaluation was compared with the baseline results ofa similar time-series LSTM model as well as autoregressive mod-els, trained on the same dataset. Based on the forecasts from bothmodels, we calculate the expected billing amount left for PO basedon PO amount signed, number of invoices and amount for eachinvoice billed so far, and total number of pending invoices expected.The error rate for predicting number of billing invoices and theiramounts was around 20%. The Prophet model showed a higher ac-curacy by 10% in predicting invoices compared to the same resultswith LSTM model. The figure 4 shows a sample PO with the actualand predicted invoice amounts for the future billing cycles withProphet model. In the figure, one can observe that the predictionis quite similar to actual invoice amount except in October 2019when usage suddenly dropped.",
  "Recommendation system for renewal of PO": "Once the risk of PO is known, a ranked list of POs with likelihoodof renewal needs to be prepared, in order of urgency and highrenewal probability. To solve this, we use a scoring method tovalue the attention a PO requires. The cust_score is calculatedbased on customer portfolio ( whether enterprise/mid sized/startup),industry, market size of services by the customer, past history ofcustomer etc.The objective solution for this scoring function is below:",
  "+ PO_renewal_lead_time": "The PO_score_agg is calculated over risk and the PO amountremaining. The PO renewal lead time is added to the score. ThePO_renewal_lead_time is the time taken by the customer to renewa PO. This time can vary from a few hours to a few days and can belearned from past historical data. This aggregate PO is then addedto the cust_score, so that the score increases for high value, highrisk, enterprise customers who have higher potential of cash flowthan the others.",
  "PO_score = PO_scoreagg cust_score": "The human-in-the-loop helps analyse the rank ofPO_renewal_likelihood_score and enhance the recommendationsystem by providing recommendations based on market trends. Thehuman provides suggestions like exploring other regressors fromthe existing data features, or refer to certain events from suddenchanges in data pattern. The PO_renewal_likelihood_score hadmean accuracy of 0.29. When we explored other regressors likecontract portfolio of PO, we observed an improvement of 21.3% re-sults in the score. Thus the human-in-the-loop provided evaluationon the aggregated assessment of the risk analytics and recommen-dation system. This ranking score for each PO was then pushed to",
  ": Risk Factor chart": "the finance team, so they can accordingly act on the high-risk andhigh-value POs.In the initial deployment of the tool, the risk insights and rec-ommendations provided by the tool have been proven helpful. Theinsights helped proactive actions on the POs by the finance teammembers, thus the risk factor of approximately 27% POs went downin next few billing cycles. Similarly, large number of POs facingrisk of dispute were successfully renewed by the accounts teamon time, thus improving the cash flow. Hence the efficiency andaccuracy of our tool proved useful to the finance team.",
  "CONCLUSIONS AND DIRECTIONS FORFUTURE WORK": "In this paper, we presented a novel approach to recommendingrenewal of POs to avoid billing disputes. In this approach, wefirst built the risk analytics model on future billing cycles andstatus of PO. We used the Prophet time series forecasting modelto predict the future usage of services. We built an algorithms forthe recommendation system to calibrate PO duration and renewalof PO, along with customer portfolio, to indicate POs which areof high value. Lastly, the human-in-the-loop provides feedback onthe ranking of POs, adding in the extra dimensionality of markettrends and external factors that could influence the PO renewal.We also showed results based on a real-world application in atIT services provider domain. The results illustrate the accuracyand efficiency of the models, as well as the efficiency of the overallmethod.There are multiple directions for future research to our work.First, we can compare multiple algorithms in additional to Prophetto further improve the accuracy of the model. Although this paperfocused on the application to use the model output for ranking POsto have it reviewed by human users, future studies may make a moreautomated solution feasible. Second, we can expand the scope ofthe data set for more geography and business types, to demonstratewhether the proposed approach is applicable to broader environ-ments. Finally, there are more detailed practices involved in businesstransactions which we did not directly apply in this study. Suchpractices include discounts, finer payment cycle definitions, etc. Byincorporating knowledge of these into the model, it is possible that",
