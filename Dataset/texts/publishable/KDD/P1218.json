  "ABSTRACT": "Recent efforts in fake news detection have witnessed a surge of in-terest in using graph neural networks (GNNs) to exploit rich socialcontext. Existing studies generally leverage fixed graph structures,assuming that the graphs accurately represent the related socialengagements. However, edge noise remains a critical challenge inreal-world graphs, as training on suboptimal structures can severelylimit the expressiveness of GNNs. Despite initial efforts in graphstructure learning (GSL), prior works often leverage node featuresto update edge weights, resulting in heavy computational costs thathinder the methods applicability to large-scale social graphs. Inthis work, we approach the fake news detection problem with anovel aspect of social graph refinement. We find that the degreesof news article nodes exhibit distinctive patterns, which are in-dicative of news veracity. Guided by this, we propose DECOR, anovel application of Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodels tothe fake news detection problem. Specifically, we encapsulate ourempirical observations into a lightweight social graph refinementcomponent that iteratively updates the edge weights via a learnabledegree correction mask, which allows for joint optimization witha GNN-based detector. Extensive experiments on two real-worldbenchmarks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of DECOR. 1",

Efficiency: Unlike existing GSL approaches, DECOR avoids us-ing high dimensional features as input for GSL, and is also linearin the number of edges, thus being 7.6 - 34.1 times faster thanexisting GSL approaches.

  "RELATED WORK2.1Fake News Detection": "Fake news detection is commonly considered as a binary classifica-tion problem, with the goal of accurately predicting a given newsarticle as real or fake. Among existing studies, content-basedmethods extract semantic patterns from the news content using awide range of deep learning architectures that include RNNs and pre-trained language models (PLMs) . Some methodsalso guide model prediction with auxiliary information includingknowledge bases , evidence from external sources, visual information , and signals from thenews environment . As fake news detection is often deeplyrooted in the social context, propagation-based methods incor-porate various social features including user responses and opin-ions , user-user following relations , newssources , and user history posts to guide model prediction.Despite the rich social information incorporated, little effort hasbeen made to explore direct relations between news articles and theproperties of veracity-related news-news connections. Moreover,many methods are vulnerable to structural noise in social graphs,as they typically adopt fixed graph structures during training.",
  "Structure Learning for Robust GNNs": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive po-tential in learning node and graph representations .Despite the prior success, extensive studies have demonstratedthat GNNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks in termsof structural noise . To alleviate this issue, numerousworks have focused on learning optimized structures for real-worldgraphs, specifically via edge denoising . Motivatedby the observation that noisy edges connect nodes with dissimilarfeatures , existing methods are generally guided by feature sim-ilarity measures. For instance, conducts edge pruning basedon the Jaccard similarity between paired node features, Pro-GNN employs the feature smoothness regularization alongside low-rank constraints, and RS-GNN utilizes node feature similarityto guide the link prediction process. Nevertheless, graph structurelearning (GSL) remains underexplored under the social context of",
  "DECOR: Degree-Corrected Social Graph Refinement for Fake News DetectionKDD 23, August 610, 2023, Long Beach, CA, USA": "Next, to formulate structure learning under the DCSBM model,our basic intuition is that same-class edges (i.e., edges where = ) are more likely to be useful and informative than cross-class edges (i.e., edges where ), and hence, structure learningshould aim to give a higher weight to same-class edges. Intuitively,cross-class edges tend to indicate noisy edges, as in the examplein , where the co-engagement between them arises just bychance. Moreover, since our main goal is to classify , identifyingedges where = clearly provides highly useful information forthis task. Hence, our key idea is to perform structure learning byderiving the same-class likelihood ratio:",

R representsthe set of social user engagements, in which R is defined asa triple {(, ,)| U, P} (i.e. user has given responsesto the news article in terms of reposts). In line with most existingstudies, we treat fake news detection on social media as a binaryclassification problem. Specifically, P is split into training set Pand test set P. Article P is associated with a ground-truth label of 1 if is fake, and 0 otherwise. We formulate theproblem as follows: Problem 1 (Fake News Detection on Social Media). Givena news dataset D = {P, U, R} and ground-truth training labelsY, the goal is to learn a classifier that, given test articles P,is able to predict the corresponding veracity labels Y.",
  "News Engagement Graph": "The positive correlation between social user preferences and theusers news consumption habits has been acknowledged by prior re-search . Specifically, social media creates an echo chamber, whereindividual beliefs can be continuously reinforced by communicationand repetition within like-minded social groups .Motivated by this, we propose to capture the news veracitysignals embedded in social user engagements. To distill a compre-hensive representation of user preferences, we set a threshold tofilter the users with less than 3 engagements with news articles,and focus on a subset U U containing active users. Specifically,we construct a user engagement matrix E R|U| .

Hence, a larger A value represents stronger commoninterest between the reader groups of news article, implying sharedopinions or beliefs in the users news consumption preferences.",
  "Empirical Observations": "In this subsection, we conduct preliminary analysis on real-worldnews to explore the veracity-related structural properties on thenews engagement graph. We observe that fake and real news exhibitdistinctive patterns in terms of weighted node degrees, motivatedby which we design a degree-based social graph refinement frame-work to mitigate the edge noise issue in . Our analysis isbased on the FakeNewsNet benchmark, which consists of thePolitiFact and GossipCop datasets.",

Note that here we adoptthe product of degrees to distinguish edges with high values forboth and , and also motivated by our theoretical results in.1. Across the buckets, we observe the following patternon news co-engagement: Observation 2. Given the degrees, fake news pairs tend to havehigher (i.e. more common users than expected given the degrees),while real-fake pairs tend to have lower than both real news pairsand fake news pairs. Our two empirical observations provide distinctive degree-relatedcues pertaining to nodes (i.e. news articles) and edges (i.e. user en-gagements) on the news engagement graph (extended analysis anddiscussion are relegated to Appendix A). These patterns can guidea model in suppressing the noisy edges, as they can be leveragedto identify which edges are more likely to connect news articlesof the same veracity. Meanwhile, we find that differences in thedegree distributions can be complex (e.g., as shown in , fakenews attract more user engagements than real news in PolitiFact,but less in GossipCop). This motivates our following degree-basedinnovations for a learnable social graph refinement approach.",
  "PROPOSED FRAMEWORK DECOR": "Motivated by our empirical findings on veracity-related degreepatterns, we propose the DECOR framework for degree-correctedsocial graph refinement (overviewed in ). DECOR can beconsidered as a novel extension of the Degree-Corrected Stochas-tic Blockmodel (DCSBM) to the fake news detection scenario,which empowers fake news detectors with effective denoising ofuser engagements. Given a pair of news articles connected by com-mon users, we propose a social degree correction module to ad-just the corresponding edge weight using degrees and the newsco-engagement. This module is jointly optimized with the GNNclassifier, which leverages the corrected edge weights and newsarticle features to predict the news veracity labels.",
  "Connection with the DCSBM Model": "In .3, we observed that degree patterns are closely relatedto news veracity labels. Next, we formally demonstrate these con-nections from a theoretical perspective based on the DCSBM model, a generative model for graphs that derives edge placementlikelihoods in a degree-based manner. The benefit of DCSBM is thatit allows us to simultaneously model the effect of degree patternsand class labels, which are of key interest, in a tractable probabilisticway. Based on the DCSBM model, we will then theoretically derivea principled likelihood ratio-based approach for graph structurelearning for the fake news detection application. Framework. We first formulate the standard DCSBM under ourfake news detection scenario. Recall the news engagement graphG = {P, E} formulated in .2, where |P| = . Each newsarticle node in G is associated with a class label from the labelspace Z = {0, 1}. Consider a pair of news article nodes Pand P with co-engagement . The nodes have class labels Z and Z, respectively. Recall that is defined as thenumber of common users between and .",

We first note that Eq. 8 agrees with our empiricalfinding in Observation 2: if we fix in Eq. 8, then as long aslog() log() > 0, we observe that higher is associated witha higher , and thus a higher probability of same-class edges( = ), agreeing with where the Real-Fake edges havelowest for a given .For structure learning purposes, we could simply use (,,),",
  "which we recall is an estimator for = P( |= )": "P( | ) . However,the standard DCSBM model is built upon relatively strong assump-tions (e.g. pre-defined and values); for fitting real data, we wouldlike to relax these assumptions and allow the model to be flexiblylearned from data. The DCSBM model contains very few learnableparameters, which is a fundamental limitation in adapting to thecomplex degree-based patterns in the news engagement graph. Thismotivates us to develop DECOR, a degree-based learnable socialgraph refinement framework, which we will next describe in detail,by relaxing the assumption of log-linearity: that is, instead of treat-ing (,,) as a fixed and log-linear function defined in Eq. 8,we instead treat it as a learnable non-linear function (,,) tobe updated jointly with the rest of the model, during the structurelearning process.",
  "Social Degree Correction": "As illustrated in , the news engagement graph containsstructural noise. In light of our empirical findings on degree-veracityrelationships and the DCSBM framework, we propose to learn adegree-corrected social graph that downweights the noisy edges toeliminate their negative impacts and facilitate fake news detectionvia GNN-based classifiers.Recall that the type of an edge in the news engagement graph(i.e. connecting new articles of same or different veracity) is char-acterized by the co-engagement and degrees of the connected arti-cles. Motivated by the DCSBM models degree-based probabilisticderivation of edge placement likelihood, we propose to adjust edgeweights in the news engagement graph via learning a social degreecorrection mask M R , where M in the interval (0, 1) repre-sents the degree correction score for edge between news articlenodes and .The value of M is predicted given co-engagement of articles and , and the articles weighted node degrees and from thenews engagement graph. Specifically, we adopt a neural predictorto obtain s R2, which contains two scores for edge preservationand elimination, respectively:",

  "Experimental Setup": "5.1.1Datasets. We evaluate DECOR on the public benchmark Fak-eNewsNet , which consists of two real-world datasets: PolitiFactand GossipCop. Both datasets contain news articles annotated byleading fact-checking websites and the articles related social userengagements from Twitter. The descriptive statistics of the datasetsare summarized in .To simulate the real-world scenarios, we split the news samplesfollowing a temporal order. Specifically, the most recent 20% realand fake news instances constitute the test set, and the remaining80% instances posted earlier serve as the training set. 5.1.2Baselines. We benchmark DECOR against twelve representa-tive baseline methods, which can be categorized into the followingthree groups by model architecture:News content based methods (G1) leverage the semantic fea-tures in the news articles. Specifically, dEFEND\\c is a content-basedvariant of dEFEND without incorporating user comment texts,which utilizes a hierarchical network with the co-attention mech-anism. SAFE\\v is a content-based variant of SAFE withoutincorporating visual information from images, which leverages aCNN-based fake news detector.

(4) Existing GSL methods for edge denoising(G3) are not suited to fake news detection. One possible reason isthat these methods are similarity-guided, i.e., links between nodesof dissimilar features are strongly suppressed. However, in our fakenews detection scenario, two news articles on different topics canbe closely connected in terms of co-engagement and veracity type.(5) Compared with competitive fake news detectors, DECOR sub-stantially enhances the performance of three representative GNNbackbones. This validates the effectiveness of using degrees andco-engagement to learn a refined news engagement graph.",

We compare DECOR with two variants, namelyDECOR-COE without co-engagement, and DECOR-Deg withoutdegrees (definitions given in .3).As shown in , comparing DECOR with either DECOR-COE or DECOR-Deg, the superior fake news detection performanceof DECOR illustrates that both co-engagement and degrees play asignificant role in achieving the final improvements. Note that innumerous cases, DECOR-COE guided by degrees outperforms thecorresponding GNN backbones that utilize the raw news engage-ment graph, which is consistent with our first empirical finding(Observation 1) on the distinctive connections between node de-grees and news veracity. This further highlights the effectiveness ofincorporating degree-related properties for social graph refinement. (a) PolitiFact(b) GossipCop",
  "Performance under Label Scarcity": "Label scarcity poses an imminent challenge for real-world appli-cations of fake news detection. Due to the timely nature of newsarticles, high-quality annotations are usually scarce. We evaluatethe performance of DECOR under limited training samples, andsummarize the results in . We observe that DECOR con-sistently outperforms the competitive GNN baselines on the newsengagement graph for all training sizes: 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% ofthe data.

  "Computational Efficiency": "We evaluate the computational cost of DECOR regarding parameternumber and model runtime. Specifically, we train all models on thesame GPU device for 800 epochs, and compare the time elapsed.Note that both Pro-GNN and RS-GNN adopt the same 2-layer GCNarchitecture as the GCN method reported in .Results in validate that DECOR is able to achieve impres-sive performance gains while maintaining low computational cost.Compared with existing GSL methods, three innovations accountfor DECORs efficiency in fake news detection: (1) DECOR lever-ages low-dimensional features (i.e. degrees and co-engagement) topredict an adjustment score for each edge, whereas existing GSLmethods utilize node features that are high-dimensional in termsof news article representations. (2) DECOR utilizes a lightweightdegree correction component, which facilitates joint optimizationof the social degree correction module and the GNN detector. Incontrast, existing GSL methods adopt alternating optimization ofthe GNN and the link predictor, resulting in slower model train-ing. (3) DECOR operates as pruning on the existing edges in thenews engagement graph, whereas existing GSL methods conductpairwise computations (e.g. feature similarity) among all nodes.Hence, the complexity of DECOR is linear to the number of edges,whereas existing GSL methods incur up to quadratic complexity.These results suggest that DECOR is suitable for deployment inresource-limited scenarios, e.g., online fact-checking services.",

The number in bold font beside each user icon represents thenumber of user engagements associated with the corresponding news article.",
  "Case Study": "To further illustrate why DECOR outperforms existing social graphbased models and GSL methods, we conduct a case study to illustrateDECORs capability of downweighting the noisy edges betweenfake and real news articles.In , we visualize exemplar cases in the neighborhoodof , an influential fake news article published by a hoax newssite. From the subgraph on the left hand side, we observe that is involved in two types of edges: (1) Noisy edges with large edgeweights. is closely connected with three influential real newspieces. As these articles all focus on trending political topics, theyattract a large number of common readers. (2) Clean edges withsmall edge weights. is also connected with several fake newspieces; however, these articles attract less social users, which re-sults in small groups of common readers with . These structuralpatterns are problematic, as propagating information among noisyedges can contaminate the neighborhood, leading to suboptimalarticle representations. Existing social graph based models gener-ally assume a fixed graph structure and are thereby heavily limitedin suppressing edge noise. Prior works on similarity-guided edgedenoising also cannot address this issue, as the articles containsimilar topics but different veracity. In contrast, DECOR leveragesthe structural degree-based properties in a flexible manner. Thisfacilitates the elimination of degree-related edge noise. From thesubgraph on the right hand side of , we find that DECOR ef-fectively suppresses the noisy edges, and recognizes the clean edgesby assigning larger weights. These cases provide strong empiricalevidence that DECOR effectively refines the news engagementgraph for enhanced fake news detection.",
  "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK": "In this paper, we investigate the fake news detection problem froma novel aspect of social graph refinement. We observe that edgenoise in the news engagement graph are degree-related, and findthat news veracity labels closely correlate with two structural prop-erties: degrees and news co-engagement. Motivated by the DCSBMmodels degree-based probabilistic framework for edge placement,we develop DECOR, a degree-based learnable social graph refine-ment framework. DECOR facilitates effective suppression of noisyedges through a learnable social degree correction mask, whichpredicts an adjustment score for each edge based on the aforemen-tioned degree-related properties. Experiments on two real-worldbenchmarks demonstrate that DECOR can be easily plugged intovarious powerful GNN backbones as an enhancement. Furthermore,DECORs structural corrections are guided by low-dimensionaldegree-related features, allowing for computationally efficient ap-plications. We believe our empirical and theoretical findings willprovide insights for future research in designing and refining morecomplex multi-relational social graphs for fake news detection.",

To investigate if these observations are generalizablebeyond political news (PolitiFact) and celebrity news (GossipCop),we extend our analysis to four additional news datasets coveringthree additional topics, namely three datasets from the MC-Fakebenchmark on different topics (Syria War, Health and Covid-19)and the FANG dataset (contains news articles about politicalevents and influential rumor events).As our observations are based on social user engagement pat-terns, we focus on the news instances with social user engagements,and filter the instances without any user engagement. More specif-ically, we record social user engagements in terms of source tweetsreposting news articles and their retweets, and collect the corre-sponding user IDs. The descriptive statistics of the datasets aresummarized in .Following the same procedure of plotting and in .3, we visualize the node degree distributions of real andfake news via KDE plots in , and present the co-engagementpatterns of news article pairs in . The plots are consistentwith our two observations in that (1) the degree distributions ofnodes representing fake and real news articles exhibit a clear dif-ference; and (2) given the degrees, edges connecting fake and realnews typically have the lowest co-engagement, whereas edges con-necting fake news pairs typically have the highest co-engagement.This validates that our observed patterns are widely applicable tonews of different topics, and demonstrates promising potential ofapplying veracity-related co-engagement and degree patterns torefine social graphs that involve news of varying topics.",

Recall that Observation 2 is two-fold: (A) Real-Fake newsarticle pairs have the lowest co-engagement given the degrees; and(B) Fake-Fake pairs have higher co-engagement than real-real pairsgiven the degrees.We find that both (A) and (B) closely relate with the confirmationbias theory , which states that users tend to seek and interpretevidence that upholds their existing beliefs, so as to gain confidencein their biased views.In terms of (A), as social media platforms foster echo chambers that insulate users from opposing viewpoints, social userstend to repeatedly engage in spreading news articles on certaintopics with similar veracity. Hence, social users are less likely toshare interest in two news articles of different veracity types (i.e.,Real-Fake pairs), which accounts for lower co-engagement thanFake-Fake and Real-Real pairs with the same veracity type.The underlying phenomena for (B) may vary, as the effects ofconfirmation bias can be manifested in different forms under differ-ent topics. Under topics such as politics or Covid-19 , socialmedia platforms can induce opinion polarization, where the usersattention is highly segregated on a set of certain opinions. In termsof celebrity gossip, certain groups of social media users can engagein boundary coordination to gain control over the information .These phenomena result in sharp community structures, which canbe quantified via increased co-engagements.In conclusion, our second empirical observation can be partiallyexplained by multiple phenomena, and the underlying phenom-ena can differ across different topics. The benefits of our proposedDECOR framework () is that through incorporating a learn-able degree correction mechanism, the model is able to recognizethe complex veracity-related degree patterns in a more flexible man-ner. Hence, DECOR facilitates effective detection of news articleswithout loss of computational efficiency."
