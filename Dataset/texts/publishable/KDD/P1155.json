  "Abstract": "Efficiently finding doctors and locations is an important search problem forpatients in the healthcare domain, for which traditional information retrievalmethods tend not to work optimally. In the last ten years, knowledge graphs(KGs) have emerged as a powerful way to combine the benefits of gleaning insightsfrom semi-structured data using semantic modeling, natural language process-ing techniques like information extraction, and robust querying using structuredquery languages like SPARQL and Cypher. In this short paper, we present aKG-based search engine architecture for robustly finding doctors and locationsin the healthcare domain. Early results demonstrate that our approach can leadto significantly higher coverage for complex queries without degrading quality.",
  "Keywords: Healthcare, finding doctors and locations, knowledge graphs, Neo4j": "As the costs and complexity of healthcare continue to increase , technology can playan important role in helping connect patients with the right providers and hospitalsfor conditions that they may be seeking services or treatment for. Such a search enginefor finding doctors and locations (FDL) can be of immense benefit to patients. Whileordinary search engines, such as Google, can retrieve some relevant results, they lack",
  "Example execution of a query (What pediatricians are open on the weekend near me?)against a knowledge graph containing data on healthcare providers and services": "specificity in their results that healthcare organizations can potentially achieve due tothe latter having access to large quantities of data on providers and services.A larger technical issue is that traditional information retrieval (IR) approachesbased on matching keywords, or even more recent natural language-based approaches,may be less suitable for complex FDL queries than the structured querying approachesdeployed in the database community . Consider, for example, a query such as Whatpediatricians are open on the weekend near me? Order the results by closeness tomy city. Using a Lucene-based approach against a database that contains relevantoptions for the user, even with adjustments such as spell check and re-ranking ,",
  "An architectural overview of the proposed approach": "we found that relevant answers were not returned in the top 10 results. One reasonis that such queries require semantic interpretation (e.g., that open on the weekendshould be reformulated to a constraint that the hours or days of operation also includetimes within Saturday and Sunday) and semantic typing , but also group-byand aggregate operations that are not as well supported by natural language questionanswering.This poster proposes an architecture that uses knowledge graphs (KGs) for address-ing the coverage issue in an FDL search engine based purely on keyword matchingtechniques . Returning to the example in the previous paragraph, we can reformu-late the question as a KG query (using a Neo4j KG implementation1) and execute itas shown in .The overall architecture is schematized in . The key premise is to havea supporting semantic model (or an ontology) rich enough to support the conceptsand relations that are likely to be queried by the user . Once such an ontology hasbeen properly designed and implemented, and the underlying data is modeled usingthe ontology as a KG, a fine-tuned language model can be used to convert a natural",
  "Neo4j is a graph database that has recently witnessed much uptake in industry, and that has a simplegraph-pattern matching query language called Cypher:": "language question into a proper query. For simpler or frequently occurring questions,query templates can also be used. These are pre-built queries with placeholders,which are substituted with actual data extracted from the users question. Populatingthe template requires techniques like information extraction , which can be difficultin domain-specific contexts , while the problem of directly converting a questioninto a Neo4j query is better suited for generative AI, being an advanced cognitivetask . Currently, we are using a simple template-based approach, but the genera-tive AI approach of direct question-to-query reformulation is also being considered asnear-future work. Finally, as is standard in more traditional IR, either heuristics or alearning-to-rank approach (based on how much training information is available) canbe used to rank the results and return them to the user . In a practical implementa-tion, both the KG-based search engine and the legacy Lucene2-based system would beused to maximize coverage. Such search approaches have been successfully applied inother difficult domains, including search engines for fighting human trafficking .To evaluate an early version of the approach, we sampled a set of almost 400frequently used queries from Kaiser Permanentes search log, and found that at least80 queries that were previously returning no results (from the string matching-onlysearch engine) were now returning results using the hybrid approach that used bothstring matching and the knowledge graph. Because these are high-volume queries, theutility of the KG-based approach is therefore expected to be high.In future work, we continue to integrate more sources (including news articles) tomake for an even richer and more holistic search experience for the user. However,doing so will require more robust and comprehensive domain-specific KG construc-tion , which would include components for (domain-specific) entity resolution, noise profiling , and possibly, incorporation of external data sources likeConceptNet . We also plan to conduct deeper experiments with long-tail queriesthat are not so frequently used, but could be critical for some users as has been foundin other domains . We will also explore in future work whether the KG-based searchengine will better adapt to such queries than keyword approaches like bag-of-words,and whether advanced techniques like machine commonsense may become necessaryfor interpreting users true intent ."
