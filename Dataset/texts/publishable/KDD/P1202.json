  "ABSTRACT": "Nowadays, wind energy has drawn increasing attention as its impor-tant role in carbon neutrality and sustainable development. Whenwind power is integrated into the power grid, precise forecasting isnecessary for the sustainability and security of the system. However,the unpredictable nature and long sequence prediction make it espe-cially challenging. In this technical report, we introduce the BERTmodel applied for Baidu KDD Cup 2022, and the daily fluctuation isadded by post-processing to make the predicted results in line withdaily periodicity. Our solution achieves 3rd place of 2490 teams.The code is released at github.com/LongxingTan/KDD2022-Baidu",
  "INTRODUCTION": "Wind energy plays an important role in carbon neutrality. The pre-cise prediction of wind power can help its integration into the powersystem with sustainability and security of supply . However, theunpredictable nature of wind makes it challenging, especially forlong sequence forecasting.Transformer models are proposed for long sequence forecastingin recent research . To utilize the advantage of its capturinglong dependencies, we implement a BERT model for wind powerfuture prediction. Our solution is a single model with a single BERTblock, with both accuracy and efficiency.",
  "Dataset": "A unique spatial, dynamic wind power forecasting dataset-SDWPF is provided by Baidu and Longyuan for this competition. Thetraining data consists of 245-day records for 134 turbines. Its intervalis 10 minutes. Additionally, each sample has wind speed, winddirection, relative power, the temperature, in total ten parameters.The procedures of data preprocessing are introduced in .1.",
  "Task": "Given at most 14-day historical data, participants need to predict thefuture 2 days wind power for every turbine and every 10 minutes.There are 142 samples provided in the last phase to evaluate themodel performance, and each sample is randomly sampled overseveral months. Inference on the test data needs to be finished in10 hours in the online environment.",
  "Evaluation": "The performance is measured by the average of RMSE (root meansquare error) and MAE (mean absolute error) for each turbine asmetrics score. There are some invalid values in ground truth labelssuch as zero values, missing values, and unknown values. Based onthe task description, the metrics score for those invalid values inground truth is set to zero to ignore them.",
  "RELATED WORK": "There is already a long history of wind power forecasting. Themainstream approaches include the physical approach, statisticalapproach and the ensemble approach . The physical approachuses the meteorological service and numerical weather predictionto predict the future in a short.The statistical approach builds a model using statistical methods.The commonly used time series prediction methods include ARIMA,statistical models, and deep learning methods . Besides, nowthe long sequence time series forecasting also catches lots of at-tention from the real-world requirements. Recently, the predictioncapacity is increased by the latest transformer family, such as theInformer and Autoformer model. Informer uses the sparseattention and one-time decoder to accelerate the inference. TheAutoformer uses a decomposition method and frequency domainattention to improve its capacity in long sequence prediction. Thespatial-temporal approach is also a promising way for wind powerforecasting . The spatial information can be used to improve theforecasting accuracy . So batches of new models are proposedand achieve good results with the development of graph neural net-works, like GCN-LSTM, Graph Wavenet , Graph ConvolutionalNetwork and Graph Attention Network .",
  "SOLUTION OVERVIEW": "In this section, we explain the main components of our solution.The overall architecture of our method is shown in .We implement two pipelines to treat the problem either as amulti-step time series prediction or a spatial-temporal prediction.Whats more, we can choose to predict the generated wind powerdirectly or to predict the wind speed first and then transfer it intowind power. Besides we tried training different time scale mod-els to handle the long sequence prediction.When it comes to a time series task, each turbine can generateits samples independently. Because the whole wind farm has avery similar trend, the time series model can capture the long-termseasonality better for long sequence prediction. We tried KNN,LightGBM, RNN, TCN, BERT, Seq2seq, Wavenet, and Transformermodels.",
  "DETAILED METHOD4.1Data preprocessing": "We create the samples for each turbine every 10 minutes by slidingthe window to get more training data. There are NANs and invalidvalues in the data. We use the corresponding previous value to fillthem for training and inference. And we use a min-max scaler tostandardize the features into scope between zero and one, but leavethe target column alone.",
  "Features": "To avoid over-fitting, we try to use as fewer features as possible.The commonly used lag features, rolling features, and time featuresare not helpful according to our experiments. The temperature isnoisy, so the temperature feature is not involved.Given the unpredictable nature, its hard to predict the futuretrend and seasonality perfectly. So we try to add spatial informationand temporal information as features to improve the predictionperformance. But they are not helpful in our experiments. So finallywe only choose the wind speed and wind direction to train themodel.",
  "We choose a single BERT model as our final model to handle thelong dependencies for long sequence prediction. The BERT model": "has been widely used in all tasks in natural language processingsince its publication. In computer vision, speech, and time series,it has also been widely investigated and it achieves fruitful resultssince then. The detailed model structure we use is shown in .A token embedding layer without positional encoding can projectthe raw feature space into the attention space. The experimentsshow there is not a significant influence having positional encodingor not. The module following the embedding layer is a standardBERT encoder, with self-attention layer, feed-forward network,layer normalization and residual connection. Then 3 dense layerswith dropout can capture the crossed information from time andfeatures. The hidden sizes of the last dense layer are equal to thepredicted steps 288. And our experiments show that layer normal-ization and residual connection are both important that cant beignored. The detailed model configuration is shown in .",
  "Post-processing": "A series of post-processing strategies are employed to further im-prove forecasting accuracy. We know its important for better pre-diction to capture the trend, seasonality, and spatial information.However, we find our forecasting results dont have obvious dailyperiodicity, while the descriptive analysis in historical data showsits strong for most days. So we propose two ways to solve it. Thefirst one is to add the daily fluctuation by post-processing. Thedaily average fluctuation is calculated and added to the prediction",
  "Batch sizes1024Training epochs3Learning rate0.005OptimizerAdam": "result directly. The second way is to optimize the model to makethe model learn the daily fluctuation by itself, in which the time orwind information information is added as the decoder feature todecode the BERT output further. In the end, the latter methods inmodels are not as good as the first way in our experiments.To give more details, we calculate the average wind power forevery interval. Then the daily sequence is standardized to zero and one. Because the wind power is between 0 and 1620, a multiplierof 36 is chosen to magnify it according to local validation and theleaderboard. The multiplier could force the daily fluctuation toinfluence the predictions in a reasonable scope. For larger values,we further magnify them by multiplying a constant value like 1.1.Finally, the daily fluctuation sequence needs to match the predictedstart time by shifting it, as not all predictions start from 00:00. In thisway, the predicted future sequence could reflect the daily periodwith the same daily fluctuation level with historical data.",
  "EXPERIMENT5.1Validation strategy": "There are 3 phases of online test data in the competition, with atemporal relationship. So we leave a gap between offline trainingdata and validation data to simulate this scenario. The trainingdata we choose is between the 1st and 181st day, and the offlinevalidation data is between the 231st and 245th day as shown in.Considering we use 250982 valid samples as local validation,while the online test data use only 150-200 samples, we submit themodel unless the local validation score is improved to decrease therisk of shaking down. Because the concept drift issue occurs fortime-related task, in the last phase, we modified the model basedon our best model in the second phase.",
  "Results and comparison": "In this section, we compare the different models performancesfrom our experiments. The results of the time series model andspatial-temporal model are shown in . To make the localvalidation comparable with the leaderboard, the MAE, RMSE andmetrics scores are transferred to the sum of 195 samples results.We can see that the deep learning methods behave better thanstatistical learning methods like KNN or LGB in our experiments.",

The spatial information definitelycould help more accurate predictions. As for the spatial relationship,we tried the spatial-temporal models to capture the spatial relation-ship automatically, but our implementations are not so successfulin the leaderboard. Now that every turbines power trend is quitesimilar, we focus more on its temporal properties afterward.",
  "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK": "In this technical report, we introduce our BERT solution for BaiduKDD Cup 2022 wind power forecasting. The BERT model can pre-dict the primary trend for the long sequence prediction, and thedaily fluctuation is added by post-processing to make the predictionwith daily periodicity. Though the single BERT model is accurateand efficient, it can still be enhanced in many ways like transferlearning or the graph model.
