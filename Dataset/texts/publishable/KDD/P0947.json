  "INTRODUCTION": "In this comprehensive study, we explore the complex domain ofDeep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), focusing on a thorough com-parison of three well-known models: Deep Q-Networks (DQN),Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Advantage Actor-Critic(A2C), specifically within the BreakOut Atari game environment.To ensure consistency and robustness in our experiments, we ex-clusively utilized the well-established implementations of DQN,PPO, and A2C from the Stable Baselines3 (SB3) framework .

Specifically, we varied the learning rates across theDQN, PPO, and A2C models from SB3 to identify how these ratesinfluenced the speed and efficiency of learning, as well as the over-all strategy development within the game, and gamma discountfactors to examine how short-term versus long-term reward priori-tization affected the models decision-making processes and overallperformance.This aspect of our study was key for revealing each modelscapability to balance immediate rewards with future ones, a criticalconsideration in many real-world applications of DRL. Throughthis comprehensive approach, our research provides insights intothe optimal configuration of these models for efficient and effectivelearning in complex environments.",
  "RELATED WORK": "Deep Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a significant fieldcombining Deep Learning (DL) with Reinforcement Learning (RL),notably impacting areas like gaming and robotics. The developmentof DQNs marked a turning point in DRL by demonstrating theeffective use of neural networks with Q-learning to play Atari 2600video games. It set a new precedent for applying DL to approximateQ-values. Subsequent enhancements, such as Double DQN andDueling DQN , addressed key issues like Q-value overestimationand improved DQNs stability.PPO, introduced in , advanced policy gradient methods. PPO isespecially noted for its efficient balance between sample efficiencyand ease of implementation. Its stable and reliable policy updateshave made it one of the preferred choice in the DRL community.A2C, a simplified version of the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C), has been influential in actor-critic methods. A2C,while maintaining the dual advantages of learning policy and valuefunctions, removes the complexity of asynchronous operations, asdescribed in .Comparative studies in gaming environments, such as the oneconducted in , provide insight into the practical applicationsof these models and help to understand their strengths and weak-nesses. However, challenges like sample efficiency, stability, andgeneralization still persist in DRL. Current research efforts in thisfield are focused on addressing these issues to enhance the effi-ciency, scalability, and broader applicability of DRL models.",
  "METHODOLOGY": "Our experiments focused on the influence of varying hyperparame-ters. We tested four to five learning rates for each model to observethe effects on convergence and training robustness, and gammavalues to explore the prioritization of long-term versus immediaterewards. The training for each model was consistently conductedover a fixed number of episodes, with episode reward and learn-ing stability as our primary performance metrics. This approachfacilitated a controlled and replicable comparison across the mod-els, ensuring that any observed differences in performance wereattributable to the models intrinsic characteristics and the selectedhyperparameters.",
  "Implementation of the models": "Opting for SB3 allowed us to ensure that each of the three modelsadhered to the highest standards and best practices within the fieldof DRL.The DQN implementation is directly inspired by the architectureoutlined in . The consistent and reliable performance of the SB3version of DQN offered a robust foundation for our comparativeexploration, particularly within the context of the BreakOut game.PPO is particularly notable for its balance between sample efficiencyand simplicity in implementation, aligning with the original designprinciples laid out by . Finally, the A2C model maintains thecore advantages of A3C while removing the need for asynchronousoperations, as detailed in .",
  "Hyperparameter Variations": "We explored a spectrum of learning rates to evaluate the differentspeeds of learning and robustness of strategy development. In tan-dem, we manipulated the gamma discount factor with two distinctvalues, 0.99 and 0.90, to assess the models sensitivity to short-termversus long-term rewards.Our structured approach provides a foundation for an in-depthevaluation of the learning dynamics and performance efficacy ofeach model, which we will further develop in the Experiment Setupand Results sections.",
  "Alignment of BreakOut Dynamics withDQNs Value Estimation": "In the BreakOut game, the dynamics are particularly well suited forthe Q-learning algorithm, upon which the DQN is based. Q-learningseeks to learn a value function (,), representing the expectedreturn of taking an action in a state and following the optimalpolicy thereafter. For BreakOut, the state can be described by theposition of the paddle, the ball, and the configuration of the bricks, while the action corresponds to moving the paddle left, right, orstaying in place.The games immediate and clear reward structurepoints gainedfrom breaking bricksaligns with the value estimation approach ofDQN. The Q-function for DQN is updated using the following rule:",
  "new(,) (,) + [+1 + max (+1,) (,)]": "where is the learning rate, is the discount factor, +1 is theimmediate reward, and max (+1,) is the maximum predictedvalue for the next state+1, over all possible actions. This formulaallows DQN to incrementally improve its policy by learning fromthe immediate outcomes of its actions, which in BreakOut are bothstraightforward and tightly coupled with the action taken.Contrastingly, on-policy methods like PPO and A2C involveestimating the policy directly. The policy (|) represents theprobability of taking action in state , and is adjusted in thedirection suggested by the policy gradient:",
  "=0 log ( |) (,)": "The advantage function (,), which measures the relativevalue of an action compared to the average, is more complex toestimate in a game like BreakOut. The reason is that certain strate-gies, like \"tunneling\", where the ball is directed behind the brickwall to clear multiple bricks, require careful planning and a detailedunderstanding of the games physics, which are not immediatelyobvious from the reward signal.Estimating the value of strategies can be more challenging thandirectly mapping actions to outcomes, as done in Q-learning. DQNsvalue estimation through Q-learning is more straightforward be-cause it can directly correlate actions like \"move the paddle underthe ball\" with receiving points for breaking bricks. In contrast,PPO and A2C must learn through trial and error which complexsequences of actions yield higher returns. This makes DQN poten-tially more suited for BreakOut, where the optimal policy involvesclear and direct action-reward correlations, making the value func-tion approach more effective than direct policy estimation in thiscontext.",
  "Advantage of Experience Replay in DQN": "The concept of experience replay is fundamental to the success ofDQN. In the BreakOut game, the mechanics often lead to repetitivescenarios where the paddle must hit the ball in a rhythmic pattern.These recurrent interactions between the ball and paddle couldpotentially lead to a form of learning that is too specialized oroptimized for the frequent but limited scenarios encountered.The experience replay mechanism mitigates this risk by storinga history of experiences:",
  "= (,,+1,+1)": "in a replay buffer . This buffer acts as a diversified data reser-voir from which the DQN samples to update the value function.This process ensures that the DQN does not simply memorizethe most recent or frequent patterns but instead develops a moregeneralized understanding of the game by learning from a broaderrange of experiences.",
  "A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING MODELS: DQN VS PPO VS A2CACM KDD 2024 | Barcelona, Spain, August 25-29, 2024,": "The advantage of such an approach in BreakOut is twofold: ithelps DQN avoid local optima by not getting stuck in repetitivebut suboptimal strategies, and it allows DQN to learn from rare,high-reward episodes, such as when the ball reaches the back of thebrick wall creating a tunnel, ensuring these crucial experiencesare not lost.Continuously revisiting diverse past experiences makes DQNstraining more robust and less prone to overfitting. This is especiallybeneficial in BreakOut, where subtle differences between goodand great strategies are crucial. Experience replay enhances bothlearning and retention of effective strategies, which is essential formastering repetitive and pattern-based environments.",
  "Sensitivity to Hyperparameters AcrossModels": "The sensitivity of an algorithm to its hyperparameters can greatlyinfluence its performance. Our hypothesis suggests that DQN andPPO will be less sensitive to learning rate variations, while A2Cwill display greater sensitivity.DQNs use of experience replay and fixed Q-targets provides astabilizing effect on learning updates. The experience replay ran-domizes the data, thus breaking correlations in the observationsequence and smoothing changes in the data distribution. Thisleads to stable gradient descent updates, allowing DQN to handle awider range of learning rates.The robustness of PPO comes from its objective function, whichuses a clipping mechanism to prevent excessively large policy up-dates that could lead to instability. This clipping mechanism actsas a safeguard against the potential negative effects of choosing asuboptimal learning rate.On the other hand, A2Cs performance is closely tied to its learn-ing rate. As an on-policy algorithm, A2C continuously updates itspolicy based on the latest data it collects from the environment. Ifthe learning rate is too low, A2Cs policy may not adapt quicklyenough to new information, leading to suboptimal performance.On the contrary, a high learning rate might cause the policy tochange too fast, destabilizing the learning process. Therefore, theideal learning rate for A2C should balance quick data integrationand instability avoidance.Discount factors also play a crucial role in the learning process.A high discount factor makes an algorithm more farsighted byplacing more emphasis on future rewards. This could potentiallybe more beneficial for DQN, as it may enable the agent to betterrecognize the long-term benefits of strategic moves like tunneling.A lower could make the agent myopic, prioritizing immediate re-wards, which might suffice for simpler strategies but fail to capturethe depth of the games strategic possibilities.In the case of PPO and A2C, a well-chosen discount factor helpsin balancing the trade-off between exploring new strategies andexploiting known rewarding behaviors. PPOs ability to maintainstable updates might be less affected by the discount factor com-pared to A2C, as the latter can be more sensitive to the choice of due to its direct policy update mechanism.In summary, we hypothesize that DQN and PPO will exhibita higher tolerance to hyperparameter variations, while A2C willrequire careful tuning of its learning rate and discount factor to",
  "CLIP() = Emin( () , clip( (), 1 , 1 + ) )": "where () is the ratio of the new policy to the old policy proba-bilities, is the estimator of the advantage function at time , and is a hyperparameter that defines the clipping range.Conversely, A2C updates policies after every step, lacking PPOsclipping barriers, which can lead to more aggressive policy changes:",
  "= log ( |)(,)": "The absence of a clipping mechanism in A2C allows for largerand more disruptive policy updates, especially when the advantage(,) is significant.We expect PPO to exhibit more stable learning progression due toits conservative update strategy, whereas A2C may show more fluc-tuations in its performance. This variability reflects A2Cs respon-siveness to immediate environmental changes, which can result inrapid but occasionally unstable learning trajectories.These hypotheses serve not only as predictions to be testedagainst the empirical data but also as a framework to interpretthe complexities of model behaviors. They reflect a balance be-tween established theoretical knowledge and the particularities ofBreakOut.",
  "Gamma Discount Factor: we varied the gamma discountfactor between = 0.99 and = 0.90": "For our experiments, training duration was quantified in terms offrames rather than time or episodes, providing a consistent measureacross all models. Each model was trained for approximately 20 mil-lion frames. This metric offers an objective standard of comparison,ensuring no model is unintentionally favored by the measurementapproach.The frame-based approach aligns with the conventions of theSB3 framework and allows for a fair assessment of each modelslearning process, as it accounts for variations in episode lengths. Forinstance, more skilled agents may play fewer but longer episodes.",
  "ACM KDD 2024 | Barcelona, Spain, August 25-29, 2024,Neil de la Fuente and Daniel Vidal": "and 1f, translating learning into performance gains with remarkablespeed. In contrast, PPO and A2C, despite their eventual improve-ments, needed longer episodes for similar levels of reward, indicat-ing potentially less efficient strategies. This behavior underscoresa strategic divergence where DQN prioritizes exploitation of theknown dynamics, while PPO and A2C seem to invest heavily inexploration, an approach that may lead to substantial benefits inless structured and more complex environments, but maybe not insimpler environments like BreakOut.The practical implications of our findings are significant. Theysuggest that while DQN shines in environments requiring rapidlearning and deployment, PPO and A2C may offer advantages in sce-narios where the depth of exploration and comprehensive strategydevelopment are key. Such insights are highly valuable for the im-proved selection and application of reinforcement learning models,emphasizing the importance of aligning the models strengths withthe specific demands and constraints of the task and environment.In summary, our results substantiate the hypotheses posed inour theoretical considerations, illustrating the nuanced interplaybetween model architectures, hyperparameters, and the BreakOutgame dynamics. The collected data provides a comprehensive pic-ture of how each models unique characteristics influence its learn-ing trajectory and overall performance in a standardized environ-ment. These insights prompt a reevaluation of the preferred usecases for these models in the field of DRL.",
  "Evaluation Metrics": "To assess the effectiveness of each model, we employed multipleevaluation metrics. These metrics are critical as they capture vari-ous aspects of the learning process and the models proficiency innavigating the environment.Average Reward per Episode: Measures the mean score perepisode. Higher scores indicate better strategies and more efficientgameplay.Episodes to Threshold: Counts the episodes needed to con-sistently reach reward thresholds, indicating how fast the modellearns in terms of episodes.Time to Threshold: Measures the hours needed to reach rewardthresholds, showing learning speed.Reward Distribution: Shows reward spread and variation, indi-cating performance consistency. Narrow spread suggests stability;wide spread suggests exploratory behaviour and instability.Stability of Learning: Monitors performance fluctuations overtime. Smooth progression indicates steady learning; large variationssuggest instability.Frame Utilization Efficiency: Evaluates how efficiently modelsuse allocated frames, indicating purposeful learning and avoidingwasteful gameplay with loops.Each of these metrics contributes to a composite picture of modelperformance. By examining these various facets, we can discernnot only which model achieved the highest scores but also under-stand the nuances of their learning processes. This multifacetedevaluation is designed to dissect the models responses to differentconfigurations within the standardized BreakOut environment, set-ting the stage for a detailed analysis of their respective strengthsand weaknesses.",
  "Performance Across Learning Rates": "From the data, DQN showed, in a, remarkable resilienceacross a broad span of learning rates, consistent with our hypothesisthat its experience replay buffer would confer robustness againstthe variability in learning rates. PPO also showed resistance to changes in learning rate as it canbe seen in b, though its performance was more sensitiveto the extremes. At the lower end of the learning rate spectrum,PPOs progress was gradual but consistent. However, at higher rates,PPOs performance was more variable, likely due to the algorithmsclipped objective function which, while mitigating the risk of largedestructive updates, also caps the potential rapid advancementsthat can be achieved with more aggressive learning rates.In contrast, A2Cs performance was heavily influenced by thelearning rate as shown in c. At lower rates, A2Cs learningcurve was almost dead, suggesting an inability to make significantpolicy improvements. As the learning rate increased, A2Cs per-formance improved markedly, confirming our prediction that A2Crequires a careful balance in learning rate settings to optimize itscontinuous policy updates.",
  "Adaptability to Discount Factor Variations": "The gamma () discount factor influences the agents considerationof future rewards. Across all models, a higher value typicallycorrelated with a more strategic play, where long-term gains wereprioritized. DQNs performance peaked at a moderate value beforedeclining, suggesting a sweet spot where the agent was sufficientlyforesighted without being impeded by the overvaluation of distantfuture rewards.PPO and A2C demonstrated a clearer preference for a higher value. This was particularly true for PPO, which displayed ansteady increase in performance as the value rose, aligning withthe algorithms inherent stability and its capability to evaluatelong-term strategies effectively.",
  "Learning Stability, Efficiency, and RewardOptimization": "In examining the learning process of DQN, PPO, and A2C models,we considered several critical aspects: the stability and efficiencyof learning, reward optimization, and episode length within theBreakOut Atari game. DQNs performance stood out, demonstratinga smooth learning curve and efficient frame utilization, highlightingits capability to rapidly assimilate and apply successful strategies.This was mirrored in its real-time training efficiency, where DQNconsistently achieved high rewards in shorter durations, making itan ideal candidate for scenarios demanding quick adaptation andtime-efficient learning. This can be clearly seen in d.Contrastingly, PPO and A2C experienced more pronounced fluc-tuations in their learning trajectories. PPO, though displaying areasonable level of stability, tended to engage in lengthier episodes,suggesting a propensity for a more exploratory approach that maysacrifice swiftness for thoroughness. A2Cs learning curve was themost variable, reflecting its sensitivity to environmental dynamicsand possibly a greater need for exploration to refine its policy. Thehigher number of frames A2C required to reach performance levelscomparable to DQN implies a less efficient learning process, espe-cially marked when considering the models real-time performance,which lagged behind the others.Furthermore, reward optimization and episode length analysisrevealed strategic distinctions among the models. DQNs strategyexcelled in securing high scores efficiently, as seen in Figures 1e",
  "Below we list the main insights extracted from our study:": "DQN: A Contender for Efficiency: The studys revela-tions denote DQNs unexpected superiority in environmentswith clear, immediate reward structures. DQNs method-ical approach to value estimation is well-suited to suchscenarios, allowing for a rapid and efficient developmentof effective strategies. This efficiency is achieved, in part,thanks to the experience replay buffer, which enables DQNto draw from a diverse set of past experiences, preventingover-specialization and promoting a robust policy that gen-eralizes across a multitude of game states. Model Adaptability and Hyperparameter Resilience:DQNs performance exhibits commendable resilience to hy-perparameter fluctuations, making it a versatile and forgiv-ing model for practitioners. This adaptability is contrastedwith PPO and A2C, which, despite their advanced policyoptimization capabilities, show a pronounced sensitivityto hyperparameter settings. This needs a fine-grained tun-ing process to navigate the trade-offs between explorationand exploitation, especially in environments where the re-ward pathways are less direct and the strategic demands arehigher. PPO and A2C for Strategic Exploration: In environmentsthat reward deep exploration and complex strategy develop-ment, PPO and A2C demonstrate their power. Their policygradient methods become advantageous in more complex",
  "state spaces. While these models may require extended pe-riods to converge on highly rewarding strategies, their po-tential in tasks demanding a sophisticated level of strategicplanning is evident": "Towards a Contextual Model Selection Framework: Thecomparative performance of DQN, PPO, and A2C accentu-ates the necessity for a contextual approach to model selec-tion in DRL. Our findings suggest that while DQN is optimalfor tasks demanding quick learning and efficient adaptation,environments characterized by their difficulty and strategiccomplexity may benefit from the exploratory strengths ofPPO and A2C. Implications for Practical Application: The implicationsof our findings for the practical application of DRL are var-ious. They serve as a guide for practitioners in choosing amodel that not only fits the immediate needs of the taskbut also aligns with the long-term objectives of the learningprocess. As our understanding of DRL models deepens, itbecomes clear that the decision-making framework for se-lecting a DRL model must be as dynamic and diverse as themodels themselves.In conclusion, the study emphasizes the importance of carefullyselecting DRL models based on their suitability for the specific task,rather than their perceived complexity. This strategy ensures thatthe chosen model is both theoretically robust and practically effec-tive, capable of leveraging the unique dynamics of the environmentto achieve optimal learning and performance.",
  "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK": "This study has detailedly evaluated DQN, PPO, and A2C withinthe BreakOut Atari environment, revealing distinct capabilities andperformance profiles for each model. DQN, traditionally viewedas a simpler model, has demonstrated its robustness and efficiencyin a controlled setting, suggesting that its utility in practical appli-cations remains significant, especially in environments with clear,immediate reward structures. PPO and A2C, while typically favoredfor complex tasks due to their advanced policy optimization tech-niques, require careful tuning and strategy development, which canbe advantageous in more intricate or less predictable environments.The findings highlight the importance of choosing the right modelbased on the specific characteristics and requirements of the taskenvironment.Future research should expand on the comparative analysis ofDQN, PPO, and A2C across a wider range of environments, includ-ing those with delayed rewards and higher complexity. Furtherinteresting studies could research the impact of additional hyper-parameters, network architectures, and reward shaping techniqueson the performance of these models.Lastly, the exploration of DRL applications in real-world scenar-ios, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and financial modeling,where the environment is often unpredictable and complex, willbe essential in translating these findings into tangible benefits andadvancements in the field of AI.",
