  "Abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to motor symptoms, including gaitimpairment. The effectiveness of levodopa therapy, a common treatment for PD, can fluctuate, causing periods ofimproved mobility (\"on\" state) and periods where symptoms re-emerge (\"off\" state). These fluctuations impactgait speed and increase in severity as the disease progresses. This paper proposes a transformer-based method thatuses both Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and accelerometer data from wearable devices to enhanceindoor localization accuracy. A secondary goal is to determine if indoor localization, particularly in-home gaitspeed features (like the time to walk between rooms), can be used to identify motor fluctuations by detecting if aperson with PD is taking their levodopa medication or not. The method is evaluated using a real-world datasetcollected in a free-living setting, where movements are varied and unstructured. Twenty-four participants, livingin pairs (one with PD and one control), resided in a sensor-equipped smart home for five days. The results showthat the proposed network surpasses other methods for indoor localization. The evaluation of the secondary goalreveals that accurate room-level localization, when converted into in-home gait speed features, can accuratelypredict whether a PD participant is taking their medication or not.",
  "Introduction": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition that affects approximately 6 million individuals globally.It manifests through various motor symptoms, including bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity, and gait impairment. Acommon complication associated with levodopa, the primary medication for PD, is the emergence of motor fluctuations that arelinked to medication timing. Initially, patients experience a consistent and extended therapeutic effect when starting levodopa.However, as the disease advances, a significant portion of patients begin to experience \"wearing off\" of their medication beforethe next scheduled dose, resulting in the reappearance of parkinsonian symptoms, such as slowed gait. These fluctuations insymptoms negatively impact patients quality of life and often necessitate adjustments to their medication regimen. The severityof motor symptoms can escalate to the point where they impede an individuals ability to walk and move within their own home.Consequently, individuals may be inclined to remain confined to a single room, and when they do move, they may require more timeto transition between rooms. These observations could potentially be used to identify periods when PD patients are experiencingmotor fluctuations related to their medication being in an ON or OFF state, thereby providing valuable information to both cliniciansand patients. A sensitive and accurate ecologically-validated biomarker for PD progression is currently unavailable, which has contributed tofailures in clinical trials for neuroprotective therapies in PD. Gait parameters are sensitive to disease progression in unmedicatedearly-stage PD and show promise as markers of disease progression, making measuring gait parameters potentially useful in clinicaltrials of disease-modifying interventions. Clinical evaluations of PD are typically conducted in artificial clinic or laboratory settings,which only capture a limited view of an individuals motor function. Continuous monitoring could capture symptom progression,including motor fluctuations, and sensitively quantify them over time. While PD symptoms, including gait and balance parameters, can be measured continuously at home using wearable devicescontaining inertial motor units (IMUs) or smartphones, this data does not show the context in which the measurements are taken.Determining a persons location within a home (indoor localization) could provide valuable contextual information for interpretingPD symptoms. For instance, symptoms like freezing of gait and turning in gait vary depending on the environment, so knowing apersons location could help predict such symptoms or interpret their severity. Additionally, understanding how much time someonespends alone or with others in a room is a step towards understanding their social participation, which impacts quality of life inPD. Localization could also provide valuable information in the measurement of other behaviors such as non-motor symptoms likeurinary function (e.g., how many times someone visits the toilet room overnight). IoT-based platforms with sensors capturing various modalities of data, combined with machine learning, can be used for unobtrusiveand continuous indoor localization in home environments. Many of these techniques utilize radio-frequency signals, specifically theReceived Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), emitted by wearables and measured at access points (AP) throughout a home. Thesesignals estimate the users position based on perceived signal strength, creating radio-map features for each room. To improvelocalization accuracy, accelerometer data from wearable devices, along with RSSI, can be used to distinguish different activities(e.g., walking vs. standing). Since some activities are associated with specific rooms (e.g., stirring a pan on the stove is likely tooccur in a kitchen), accelerometer data can enhance RSSIs ability to differentiate between adjacent rooms, an area where RSSIalone may be insufficient. The heterogeneity of PD, where symptoms and their severity vary between patients, poses a challenge for generalizing accelerometerdata across different individuals. Severe symptoms, such as tremors, can introduce bias and accumulated errors in accelerometer data,particularly when collected from wrist-worn devices, which are a common and well-accepted placement location. Naively combiningaccelerometer data with RSSI may degrade indoor localization performance due to varying tremor levels in the acceleration signal.This work makes two primary contributions to address these challenges. (1) We detail the use of RSSI, augmented by accelerometer data, to achieve room-level localization. Our proposed networkintelligently selects accelerometer features that can enhance RSSI performance in indoor localization. To rigorously assess ourmethod, we utilize a free-living dataset (where individuals live without external intervention) developed by our group, encompassingdiverse and unstructured movements as expected in real-world scenarios. Evaluation on this dataset, including individuals with andwithout PD, demonstrates that our network outperforms other methods across all cross-validation categories. (2) We demonstrate how accurate room-level localization predictions can be transformed into in-home gait speed biomarkers (e.g.,number of room-to-room transitions, room-to-room transition duration). These biomarkers can effectively classify the OFF or ONmedication state of a PD patient from this pilot study data.",
  "Related Work": "Extensive research has utilized home-based passive sensing systems to evaluate how the activities and behavior of individuals withneurological conditions, primarily cognitive dysfunction, change over time. However, there is limited work assessing room use inthe home setting in people with Parkinsons. Gait quantification using wearables or smartphones is an area where a significant amount of work has been done. Cameras canalso detect parkinsonian gait and some gait features, including step length and average walking speed. Time-of-flight devices,which measure distances between the subject and the camera, have been used to assess medication adherence through gait analysis.From free-living data, one approach to gait and room use evaluation in home settings is by emitting and detecting radio waves tonon-invasively track movement. Gait analysis using radio wave technology shows promise to track disease progression, severity, andmedication response. However, this approach cannot identify who is doing the movement and also suffers from technical issueswhen the radio waves are occluded by another object. Much of the work done so far using video to track PD symptoms has focusedon the performance of structured clinical rating scales during telemedicine consultations as opposed to naturalistic behavior, andthere have been some privacy concerns around the use of video data at home. RSSI data from wearable devices is a type of data with fewer privacy concerns; it can be measured continuously and unobtrusivelyover long periods to capture real-world function and behavior in a privacy-friendly way. In indoor localization, fingerprinting usingRSSI is the typical technique used to estimate the wearable (user) location by using signal strength data representing a coarse andnoisy estimate of the distance from the wearable to the access point. RSSI signals are not stable; they fluctuate randomly due toshadowing, fading, and multi-path effects. However, many techniques have been proposed in recent years to tackle these fluctuationsand indirectly improve localization accuracy. Some works utilize deep neural networks (DNN) to generate coarse positioningestimates from RSSI signals, which are then refined by a hidden Markov model (HMM) to produce a final location estimate. Otherworks try to utilize a time series of RSSI data and exploit the temporal connections within each access point to estimate room-levelposition. A CNN is used to build localization models to further leverage the temporal dependencies across time-series readings. It has been suggested that we cannot rely on RSSI alone for indoor localization in home environments for PD subjects due toshadowing rooms with tight separation. Some researchers combine RSSI signals and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to testthe viability of leveraging other sensors in aiding the positioning system to produce a more accurate location estimate. Classicmachine learning approaches such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) aretested, and the result shows that the RF outperforms other methods in tracking a person in indoor environments. Others combinesmartphone IMU sensor data and Wi-Fi-received signal strength indication (RSSI) measurements to estimate the exact location (inEuclidean position X, Y) of a person in indoor environments. The proposed sensor fusion framework uses location fingerprinting incombination with a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm to reduce positioning errors. Looking at this multi-modality classification/regression problem from a time series perspective, there has been a lot of explorationin tackling a problem where each modality can be categorized as multivariate time series data. LSTM and attention layers areoften used in parallel to directly transform raw multivariate time series data into a low-dimensional feature representation for eachmodality. Later, various processes are done to further extract correlations across modalities through the use of various layers (e.g.,concatenation, CNN layer, transformer, self-attention). Our work is inspired by prior research where we only utilize accelerometer data to enrich the RSSI, instead of utilizing all IMU sensors, in order to reduce battery consumption. In addition, unlike previouswork that stops at predicting room locations, we go a step further and use room-to-room transition behaviors as features for a binaryclassifier predicting whether people with PD are taking their medications or withholding them.",
  "Cohort and Dataset": "**Dataset:** This dataset was collected using wristband wearable sensors, one on each wrist of all participants, containing tri-axialaccelerometers and 10 Access Points (APs) placed throughout the residential home, each measuring the RSSI. The wearable deviceswirelessly transmit data using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard, which can be received by the 10 APs. Each AP records thetransmitted packets from the wearable sensor, which contains the accelerometer readings sampled at 30Hz, with each AP recordingRSSI values sampled at 5 Hz. The dataset contains 12 spousal/parent-child/friend-friend pairs (24 participants in total) living freely in a smart home for five days.Each pair consists of one person with PD and one healthy control volunteer (HC). This pairing was chosen to enable PD vs. HCcomparison, for safety reasons, and also to increase the naturalistic social behavior (particularly amongst the spousal pairs whoalready lived together). From the 24 participants, five females and seven males have PD. The average age of the participants is 60.25(PD 61.25, Control 59.25), and the average time since PD diagnosis for the person with PD is 11.3 years (range 0.5-19). To measure the accuracy of the machine learning models, wall-mounted cameras are installed on the ground floor of the house,which capture red-green-blue (RGB) and depth data 2-3 hours daily (during daylight hours at times when participants were at home).The videos were then manually annotated to the nearest millisecond to provide localization labels. Multiple human labelers usedsoftware called ELAN to watch up to 4 simultaneously-captured video files at a time. The resulting labeled data recorded the kitchen,hallway, dining room, living room, stairs, and porch. The duration of labeled data recorded by the cameras for PD and HC is 72.84and 75.31 hours, respectively, which provides a relatively balanced label set for our room-level classification. Finally, to evaluatethe ON/OFF medication state, participants with PD were asked to withhold their dopaminergic medications so that they were inthe practically-defined OFF medications state for a temporary period of several hours during the study. Withholding medicationsremoves their mitigation on symptoms, leading to mobility deterioration, which can include slowing of gait. **Data pre-processing for indoor localization:** The data from the two wearable sensors worn by each participant were combined ateach time point, based on their modality, i.e., twenty RSSI values (corresponding to 10 APs for each of the two wearable sensors)and accelerometry traces in six spatial directions (corresponding to the three spatial directions (x, y, z) for each wearable) wererecorded at each time point. The accelerometer data is resampled to 5Hz to synchronize the data with RSSI values. With a 5-secondtime window and a 5Hz sampling rate, each RSSI data sample has an input of size (25 x 20), and accelerometer data has an input ofsize (25 x 6). Imputation for missing values, specifically for RSSI data, is applied by replacing the missing values with a value that isnot possible normally (i.e., -120dB). Missing values exist in RSSI data whenever the wearable is out of range of an AP. Finally, alltime-series measurements by the modalities are normalized. **Data pre-processing for medication state:** Our main focus is for our neural network to continuously produce room predictions,which are then transformed into in-home gait speed features, particularly for persons with PD. We hypothesize that during theirOFF medication state, the deterioration in mobility of a person with PD is exhibited by how they transition between rooms. Thesefeatures include Room-to-room Transition Duration and the Number of Transitions between two rooms. Number of Transitionsrepresents how active PD subjects are within a certain period of time, while Room-to-room Transition Duration may provideinsight into how severe their disease is by the speed with which they navigate their home environment. With the layout of the housewhere participants stayed, the hallway is used as a hub connecting all other rooms labeled, and Room-to-room Transition showsthe transition duration (in seconds) between two rooms connected by the hallway. The transition between (1) kitchen and livingroom, (2) kitchen and dining room, and (3) dining room and living room are chosen as the features due to their commonality acrossall participants. For these features, we limit the transition time duration (i.e., the time spent in the hallway) to 60 seconds to excludetransitions likely to be prolonged and thus may not be representative of the persons mobility. These in-home gait speed features are produced by an indoor-localization model by feeding RSSI signals and accelerometer datafrom 12 PD participants from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, which are aggregated into 4-hour windows. From this, each PD participantwill have 20 data samples (four data samples for each of the five days), each of which contains six features (three for the mean ofroom-to-room transition duration and three for the number of room-to-room transitions). There is only one 4-hour window duringwhich the person with PD is OFF medications. These samples are then used to train a binary classifier determining whether a personwith PD is ON or OFF their medications. For a baseline comparison to the in-home gait speed features, demographic features which include age, gender, years of PD, andMDS-UPDRS III score (the gold-standard clinical rating scale score used in clinical trials to measure motor disease severity inPD) are chosen. Two MDS-UPDRS III scores are assigned for each PD participant; one is assigned when a person with PD is ONmedications, and the other one is assigned when a person with PD is OFF medications. For each in-home gait speed feature datasample, there will be a corresponding demographic feature data sample that is used to train a different binary classifier to predictwhether a person with PD is ON or OFF medications. **Ethical approval:** Full approval from the NHS Wales Research Ethics Committee was granted on December 17, 2019, andHealth Research Authority and Health and Care Research Wales approval was confirmed on January 14, 2020; the research was conducted in accord with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975; written informed consent was gained from all study participants. Inorder to protect participant privacy, supporting data is not shared openly. It will be made available to bona fide researchers subject toa data access agreement.",
  "Methodologies and Framework": "We introduce Multihead Dual Convolutional Self Attention (MDCSA), a deep neural network that utilizes dual modalities for indoorlocalization in home environments. The network addresses two challenges that arise from multimodality and time-series data: (1) Capturing multivariate features and filtering multimodal noises. RSSI signals, which are measured at multiple access pointswithin a home received from wearable communication, have been widely used for indoor localization, typically using a fingerprintingtechnique that produces a ground truth radio map of a home. Naturally, the wearable also produces acceleration measurements whichcan be used to identify typical activities performed in a specific room, and thus we can explore if accelerometer data will enrichthe RSSI signals, in particular to help distinguish adjacent rooms, which RSSI-only systems typically struggle with. If it will, howcan we incorporate these extra features (and modalities) into the existing features for accurate room predictions, particularly in thecontext of PD where the acceleration signal may be significantly impacted by the disease itself? (2) Modeling local and global temporal dynamics. The true correlations between inputs both intra-modality (i.e., RSSI signal amongaccess points) and inter-modality (i.e., RSSI signal against accelerometer fluctuation) are dynamic. These dynamics can affect oneanother within a local context (e.g., cyclical patterns) or across long-term relationships. Can we capture local and global relationshipsacross different modalities?",
  "Modality Positional Embedding": "Due to different data dimensionality between RSSI and accelerometer, coupled with the missing temporal information, a linearlayer with a positional encoding is added to transform both RSSI and accelerometer data into their respective embeddings. Supposewe have a collection of RSSI signals xr = [xr1, xr2, ..., xrT ] RT r and accelerometer data xa = [xa1, xa2, ..., xaT ] RT a withinT time units, where xrt = [xrt1, xrt2, ..., xrtr] represents RSSI signals from r access points, and xat = [xat1, xat2, ..., xata] representsaccelerometer data from a spatial directions at time t with t < T.

  "Locality Enhancement with Self-Attention": "Since it is time-series data, the importance of an RSSI or accelerometer value at each point in time can be identified in relation to itssurrounding values - such as cyclical patterns, trends, or fluctuations. Utilizing historical context that can capture local patterns ontop of point-wise values, performance improvements in attention-based architectures can be achieved. One straightforward option isto utilize a recurrent neural network such as a long-short term memory (LSTM) approach. However, in LSTM layers, the localcontext is summarized based on the previous context and the current input. Two similar patterns separated by a long period of timemight have different contexts if they are processed by the LSTM layers.

Following the modality positional embedding layer in subsection 4.1, the positional embeddings of RSSI hr = [hr1, ..., hrT ] andaccelerometer ha = [ha1, ..., haT ], produced by Eq. 1, are then fed to an MDCSA layer with various kernel sizes [k1, ..., kn]:",

We use a CRF layer to cover just that, i.e., to maximize the probability of the refined embeddings of alltime steps, so it can better model cases where refined embeddings closest to one another must be compatible (i.e., minimizing thepossibility for impossible room transitions). When finding the best sequence of room location yt, the Viterbi Algorithm is used as astandard for the CRF layer.

  "We compare our proposed network, MDCSA1,4,7 (MDCSA with 3 kernels of size 1, 4, and 7), with:": "- Random Forest (RF) as a baseline technique, which has been shown to work well for indoor localization. - A modified transformerencoder in combination with a CRF layer representing a model with the capability to capture global dependency and enforcedependencies in temporal aspects. - A state-of-the-art model for multimodal and multivariate time series with a transformer encoderto learn asymmetric correlations across modalities. - An alternative to the previous model, representing it with a GRN layer replacingthe context aggregation layer and a CRF layer added as the last layer. - MDCSA1,4,7 4APS, as an ablation study, with our proposednetwork (i.e., MDCSA1,4,7) using 4 access points for the RSSI (instead of 10 access points) and accelerometer data (ACCL) as itsinput features. - MDCSA1,4,7 RSSI, as an ablation study, with our proposed network using only RSSI, without ACCL, as its inputfeatures. - MDCSA1,4,7 4APS RSSI, as an ablation study, with our proposed network using only 4 access points for the RSSI as itsinput features. For RF, all the time series features of RSSI and accelerometry are flattened and merged into one feature vector for room-levellocalization. For the modified transformer encoder, at each time step t, RSSI xrt and accelerometer xat features are combined via alinear layer before they are processed by the networks. A grid search on the parameters of each network is performed to find the bestparameter for each model. The parameters to tune are the embedding dimension d in 128, 256, the number of epochs in 200, 300,and the learning rate in 0.01, 0.0001. The dropout rate is set to 0.15, and a specific optimizer in combination with a Look-Aheadalgorithm is used for the training with early stopping using the validation performance. For the RF, we perform a cross-validatedparameter search for the number of trees (200, 250), the minimum number of samples in a leaf node (1, 5), and whether a warm startis needed. The Gini impurity is used to measure splits. **Evaluation Metrics:** We are interested in developing a system to monitor PD motor symptoms in home environments. Forexample, we will consider if there is any significant difference in the performance of the system when it is trained with PD datacompared to being trained with healthy control (HC) data. We tailored our training procedure to test our hypothesis by performingvariations of cross-validation. Apart from training our models on all HC subjects (ALL-HC), we also perform four different kinds ofcross-validation: 1) We train our models on one PD subject (LOO-PD), 2) We train our models on one HC subject (LOO-HC), 3) Wetake one HC subject and use only roughly four minutes worth of data to train our models (4m-HC), 4) We take one PD subject anduse only roughly four minutes worth of data to train our models (4m-PD). For all of our experiments, we test our trained models onall PD subjects (excluding the one used as training data for LOO-PD and 4m-PD). For room-level localization accuracy, we useprecision and weighted F1-score, all averaged and standard deviated across the test folds. To showcase the importance of in-home gait speed features in differentiating the medication state of a person with PD, we firstcompare how accurate the Room-to-room Transition duration produced by each network is to the ground truth (i.e., annotatedlocation). We hypothesize that the more accurate the transition is compared to the ground truth, the better mobility features are formedication state classification. For the medication state classification, we then compare two different groups of features with twosimple binary classifiers: 1) the baseline demographic features (see ), and 2) the normalized in-home gait speed features.The metric we use for ON/OFF medication state evaluation is the weighted F1-Score and AUROC, which are averaged and standarddeviated across the test folds.",
  "Experimental Results": "**Room-level Accuracy:** The first part of compares the performance of the MDCSA network and other approaches forroom-level classification. For room-level classification, the MDCSA network outperforms other networks and RF with a minimumimprovement of 1.3% for the F1-score over the second-best network in each cross-validation type, with the exception of the ALL-HCvalidation. The improvement is more significant in the 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations, when the training data are limited, with anaverage improvement of almost 9% for the F1-score over the alternative to the state-of-the-art model. The LOO-HC and LOO-PD validations show that a model that has the ability to capture the temporal dynamics across time steps willperform better than a standard baseline technique such as a Random Forest. The modified transformer encoder and the state-of-the-artmodel perform better in those two validations due to their ability to capture asynchronous relations across modalities. However,when the training data becomes limited, as in 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations, having extra capabilities is necessary to furtherextract temporal information and correlations. Due to being a vanilla transformer requiring a considerable amount of trainingdata, the modified transformer encoder performs worst in these two validations. The state-of-the-art model performs quite well due to its ability to capture local context via LSTM for each modality. However, in general, its performance suffers in both theLOO-PD and 4m-PD validations as the accelerometer data (and modality) may be erratic due to PD and should be excluded attimes from contributing to room classification. The MDCSA network has all the capabilities that the state-of-the-art model has,with an improvement in suppressing the accelerometer modality when needed via the GRN layer embedded in DCSA. Suppressingthe noisy modality seems to have a strong impact on maintaining the performance of the network when the training data is limited.This is validated by how the alternative to the state-of-the-art model (i.e., the state-of-the-art model with added GRN and CRFlayers) outperforms the standard state-of-the-art model by an average of 2.2% for the F1-score in the 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations.It is further confirmed by MDCSA1,4,7 4APS against MDCSA1,4,7 4APS RSSI, with the latter model, which does not includethe accelerometer data, outperforming the former for the F1-score by an average of 1.6% in the last three cross-validations. It isworth pointing out that the MDCSA1,4,7 4APS RSSI model performed the best in the 4m-PD validation. However, the omission ofaccelerometer data affects the models ability to differentiate rooms that are more likely to have active movement (i.e., hall) than therooms that are not (i.e., living room). It can be seen from that the MDCSA1,4,7 4APS RSSI model has low performance inpredicting the hallway compared to the full model of MDCSA1,4,7. As a consequence, the MDCSA1,4,7 4APS RSSI model cannotproduce in-home gait speed features as",
  "accurately, as shown in": "**Room-to-room Transition and Medication Accuracy:** We hypothesize that during their OFF medication state, the deteriorationin mobility of a person with PD is exhibited by how they transition between rooms. To test this hypothesis, a Wilcoxon signed-ranktest was used on the annotated data from PD participants undertaking each of the three individual transitions between rooms whilstON (taking) and OFF (withholding) medications to assess whether the mean transition duration ON medications was statisticallysignificantly shorter than the mean transition duration for the same transition OFF medications for all transitions studied (see ). From this result, we argue that the mean transition duration obtained by each model from that is close to the ground truthcan capture what the ground truth captures. As mentioned in , this transition duration for each model is generated by themodel continuously performing room-level localization, focusing on the time a person is predicted to spend in a hallway betweenrooms. We show, in , that the mean transition duration for all transitions studied produced by the MDCSA1,4,7 model is theclosest to the ground truth, improving over the second best by around 1.25 seconds across all hall transitions and validations. The second part of shows the performance of all our networks for medication state classification. The demographicfeatures can be used as a baseline for each type of validation. The MDCSA network, with the exception of the ALL-HC validation,outperforms any other network by a significant margin for the AUROC score. By using in-home gait speed features produced bythe MDCSA network, a minimum of 15% improvement over the baseline demographic features can be obtained, with the biggestgain obtained in the 4m-PD validation data. In the 4m-PD validation data, RF, TENER, and DTML could not manage to provideany prediction due to their inability to capture (partly) hall transitions. Furthermore, TENER has shown its inability to provide anymedication state prediction from the 4m-HC data validations. It can be validated by when TENER failed to capture anytransitions between the dining room and living room across all periods that have ground truths. MDCSA networks can providemedication state prediction and maintain their performance across all cross-validations thanks to the addition of Eq. 13 in the lossfunction. **Limitations and future research:** One limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size (which was planned as this isan exploratory pilot study). We believe our sample size is ample to show proof of concept. This is also the first such work withunobtrusive ground truth validation from embedded cameras. Future work should validate our approach further on a large cohortof people with PD and consider stratifying for sub-groups within PD (e.g., akinetic-rigid or tremor-dominant phenotypes), whichwould also increase the generalizability of the results to the wider population. Future work in this matter could also include theconstruction of a semi-synthetic dataset based on collected data to facilitate a parallel and large-scale evaluation. This smart homes layout and parameters remain constant for all the participants, and we acknowledge that the transfer of this deeplearning model to other varied home settings may introduce variations in localization accuracy. For future ecological validation andbased on our current results, we anticipate the need for pre-training (e.g., a brief walkaround which is labeled) for each home, andalso suggest that some small amount of ground-truth data will need to be collected (e.g., researcher prompting of study participants toundertake scripted activities such as moving from room to room) to fully validate the performance of our approach in other settings.",
  "Conclusion": "We have presented the MDCSA model, a new deep learning approach for indoor localization utilizing RSSI and wrist-wornaccelerometer data. The evaluation on our unique real-world free-living pilot dataset, which includes subjects with and without PD,shows that MDCSA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for indoor localization. The availability of accelerometer data does indeedenrich the RSSI features, which, in turn, improves the accuracy of indoor localization. Accurate room localization using these data modalities has a wide range of potential applications within healthcare. This couldinclude tracking of gait speed during rehabilitation from orthopedic surgery, monitoring wandering behavior in dementia, ortriggering an alert for a possible fall (and long lie on the floor) if someone is in one room for an unusual length of time. Furthermore,accurate room use and room-to-room transfer statistics could be used in occupational settings, e.g., to check factory worker location. : Room-level and medication state accuracy of all models.

We have shown, usingroom transition duration results, that our PD cohort takes longer on average to perform a room transition when they withholdmedications. With accurate in-home gait speed features, a classifier model can then differentiate accurately if a person with PD is inan ON or OFF medication state. Such changes show the promise of these localization outputs to detect the dopamine-related gaitfluctuations in PD that impact patients quality of life and are important in clinical decision-making. We have also demonstratedthat our indoor localization system provides precise in-home gait speed features in PD with a minimal average offset to the ground",

  "Statistical Significance Test": "It could be argued that all the localization models compared in might not be statistically different due to the fairly highstandard deviation across all types of cross-validations, which is caused by the relatively small number of participants. In order tocompare multiple models over cross-validation sets and show the statistical significance of our proposed model, we perform theFriedman test to first reject the null hypothesis. We then performed a pairwise statistical comparison: the Wilcoxon signed-rank testwith Holms alpha correction."
