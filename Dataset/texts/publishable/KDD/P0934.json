This, in turn, drives growthfor platforms and their user base.In healthcare, RecSys play a crucial role, aiding both cliniciansand patients. For example, they support clinical decision-makingwith drug recommendations considering patient history of allergiesand drug interactions , facilitate finding suitable healthcareproviders , and enable access to relevant health information.Despite these advancements, leveraging RecSys for digital algo-rithmic nudging to promote healthy lifestyles across a large popula-tion remains underexplored. With the ubiquity of health devices andwearables, the data collectedranging from physical activity (steps,active exercise minutes) to vital signs (heart rate, oxygen satura-tion, blood glucose)offers a comprehensive view of an individualshealth behavior and states. Such data is used, with consent, to mo-tivate health tracking and behavior modification through nudges, aconcept rooted in behavioral economics about choices presented toguide individuals towards desired behaviors . Several wearabledevice manufacturers use rule based systems to generate nudgesthat aim to guide the consumer to focus on certain activities. Ingeneral health and wellness settings, such nudges can encourageusers to exercise more, get enough sleep, quit smoking and re-duce alcohol intake, and even help develop healthy eating habits.Similarly in clinical healthcare settings nudges can help increasepatient engagement for improving outcomes such as medicationadherence, increasing screening rates for early detection of cancers,and encouraging clinical-trial patients to stay on protocol. In gen-eral, some level of nudging is recognized as useful for most people,whether they are healthy, or if they have a noncommunicable dis-ease (NCD) like diabetes or cardiovascular disease, where behaviormodifications are critical for preventing disease progression andcomplications. At a population level, more individuals adoptinghealthy behaviors can reduce the incidence and burden of NCDs,which are responsible for 74% of deaths globally .Achieving such sustained behavior change at a large populationscale presents two notable challenges from socioeconomic andtechnical perspectives.First, changing human behavior is hard. People are creaturesof habit. To be effective, nudges need to be personalized to therecipient and contextual to their circumstances. Nudges also haveto be perceived to be coming from a human expert, and must berelevant and useful. In contrast to traditional outreach methodslike billboards and mass emails, a RecSys can provide a much moreprivate and intimate user experience by sending nudges on a regularbasis and saying the appropriate thing at the right time, which canultimately contribute to sustained behavior change.",

  "RELATED WORK": "The landscape of health behavior nudging encompasses a spectrumof strategies, from basic environmental cues to sophisticated digitalinterventions. For decades, policy makers have encouraged ap-proaches that have utilized methods such as strategic placement ofmilk and vegetables to promote nutritional needs of consumers ,used socially targeted messages on shopping trolleys to increasevegetable purchases , and the alteration of trash bag colors to improve waste disposal practices for example. Despite theirmerits, these methods lack personalization and context-awarenessnecessary for broader applicability.Advancements in consumer technology and Just-In-Time Adap-tive Interventions (JITAIs) signify a shift towards leveraging mobileand sensor technologies for real-time data collection about userschanging internal and contextual states, enabling timely and rele-vant nudges . These interventions span such a variety of healthdomains, including physical activity , alcohol cessation ,smoking cessation , and weight loss that it is impossibleto cite all the relevant studies here and we point the reader to butfew of the ones we found interesting. For example, Consolvo et al.,used a personalized display to visualize the users progress towardsdaily physical activity goals, but did not send any messages.Gustafson et al., addressed this and applied decision rules to sendtext messages: to send an alert if the users GPS location is in theproximity of a high-risk area for alcohol consumption . Rileyet al., send messages as users progress through different stagesof their care plans , and Patrick et al. incorporate a library of1,500 decision rules to decide which message to send and when,based on users state . While these interventions are context-sensitive, their reliance on a universal set of decision rules limitstheir personalization capacity.Application of Machine Learning (ML) has increasingly enabledpersonalization of health interventions to adjust to individual pref-erences. Notably, the HeartSteps app employs Reinforcement Learn-ing to tailor the timing of nudges , while other studies utilizehierarchical clustering and binary classification to refine daily goalrecommendations and employ LSTM models for exercise rec-ommendations based on predicted heart rate profiles . Theseapproaches were designed to offer study-specific personalization fora single goal and dont report results across simultaenous multiplehealth outcomes, an important criteria necessary to address poly-chronic and multiple comorbidities that exist in any populationwhich our deployed system addresses in an extensible way.We demonstrate that an AI driven extensible RecSys can offera versatile foundation for developing personalized nudge systemsapplicable across various health scenarios. We were motivated byother preliminary successes in targeted studies, such as smokingcessation efforts achieving significantly higher abstinence rateswith personalized messaging .Based on the demonstrated commercial success of RecSys in sig-nificant operational contexts across various industries, we positedthat a newly devised RecSys tailored for healthcare could suffi-ciently meet the requirements to establish a population-scale nudg-ing mechanism. Our inquiry is predicated on the notion that RecSys,particularly those enhanced with knowledge graphs, possess thecapability to adeptly expand personalized health nudging initia-tives. Knowledge graphs offer the flexibility to assimilate a widearray of health-related information, encompassing data from fit-ness tracker activities to various smart sensors and clinical records,without necessitating extensive feature engineering efforts. Thisapproach not only enriches the contextual basis for personalizationbut also leverages semantic relationships for more nuanced rec-ommendations. Examples of knowledge-enhanced RecSys includeRippleNet and KGCN , which utilize knowledge graphsfor item recommendations, KGAT , KNI , which integrate",
  "NudgeRank: Digital Algorithmic Nudging for Personalized HealthKDD 24, August 2529, 2024, Barcelona, Spain": "3.2.5Operations and Automation. To streamline production oper-ations, the key pipelines in the system are fully automated. DevOpsEngineers and Data Scientists can monitor the system and be alertedof any issues, in order to investigate and fix them quickly. The ModelTrainer automatically fine-tunes the model daily as the graph getsupdated with new data about user states and nudge interactions, toensure that model learns about user preferences in a timely manner.This was especially critical in the cold start period when the systemwas first launched and users interacted with nudges for the firsttime. Batch scoring as described in the preceding section is also au-tomated on a schedule, as data is ingested from the source systems.Finally, all pipelines capture system telemetry including graph at-tributes (e.g. number of nodes and edges, number of users, numberof nudges), pipeline performance (e.g. execution time) and modelperformance during training and fine-tuning (e.g. recommendationmetrics). 3.2.6Security and Privacy. Privacy and security of information isparamount when dealing with health data, especially in cases wherethe data comes from medical records. To ensure that the systemcomplies with global data protection standards for health data,NudgeRank is designed to work without any Personal IdentifiableInformation (PII) such as names or addresses. All user IDs in thesystem are pseudonymous masked IDs, and the system does notrequire any PII to perform its functions.Furthermore, the system is designed to be deployed in \"air gapped\"environments with private networks and no public Internet access(including private networks in the cloud), to ensure that there isno risk of data egress. Data belonging to a healthcare provider orhealth program never leaves their environment; rather, NudgeR-ank is deployed in their environment with automated CI/CD fordeployments, and remote monitoring of aggregated and anonymoussystem telemetry for daily operations.",
  "The NudgeRank system is depicted in , highlighting itsprimary components": "3.1.1Data Collection: Nudge Library and Participant Data. Thesystem commences by aggregating essential data. The Nudge Li-brary enables care program manager to author nudge templatesthat can be personalized for end users. Participant data, encompass-ing demographics, health behaviors, and more, are sourced via APIfrom mobile apps or other databases, including electronic healthrecords. This dataset is enriched by user-item interactions, captur-ing engagement with the nudges, including opening or rating them(e.g. thumbs up or down). 3.1.2Knowledge Graph Neural Network Recommender System. Datapreparation for the RecSys involves the Personal Candidate NudgeGenerator generating a tailored list of candidate nudges for eachuser based on predefined targeting rules. For example, some nudgesmay only be targeted at users over 60 years old who have walkedless than 5,000 steps in the previous week.The NudgeRank Knowledge Graph Constructor forms a hetero-geneous knowledge graph, capturing the complex interplay be-tween users, nudges, and their attributes. This graph dynamicallyupdates in response to new user data, ensuring recommendationsreflect the current contextual state of each user. Users and nudgesare represented as nodes in the graph, and directed edges capturethe history of users past interactions with the nudges. In the exam-ple in , user 1 opened nudge 1 and rated it \"useful\". Usersattributes and behaviors are represented by binary markers, whichare classified into topics. For example, user 1 has the markers \"age:30s\", \"BMI: normal\" and \"steps: 2.5k\". While the figure only illustratesa few markers, the actual graph contains over 130 markers, and canbe easily extended with more data sources and adapted to more usecases, e.g. HbA1C or blood glucose markers for diabetes. The graphalso captures knowledge about the nudges. For example, nudge2 targets segment 1 \"Inactive Young Adults\", and was written toencourage them to walk more steps.We extend prior efforts () in two important waysfor algorithmic digital nudging in health: First, besides capturing knowledge about items, the knowledgegraph also captures knowledge about users, such as their demo-graphics, health behaviors and segments. Furthermore, it capturesshared knowledge between users and items, in addition to theirinteraction histories. For example, in , users 1 and 3 arein segment 1 since they are both in their 20s and 30s, and havenot been active in either steps or MVPA. Nudge 2 targets segment1 and has a \"steps\" goal, and would therefore be a candidate nudgeto encourage 1 and 3 to walk more steps. By capturing all theknowledge about users and nudges and the relationships betweenthem, the knowledge graph provides a rich representation of theworld for the RecSys to finely tailor nudges according to each userspreferences and contextual states.Second, the graph is dynamic and updated frequently as newinformation about users are collected, to ensure that recommenda-tions are always made in the context of the users current states andbehaviors. For example, if a user had the marker \"steps: 2.5k\" oneweek ago, but the marker changed to \"steps: 10k\" this week becausethe user walked more, the users graph connections are updated toreflect this new information, and new nudges are generated withthe updated graph.Both the list of candidate nudges per user and the knowledgegraph are fed to the RecSys, which ranks the candidate nudges foreach user, based on higher-order relationships between users anditems captured in the knowledge graph.Let U be the set of users, I be the set of items (nudges), E bethe set of other entities, and R be the set of relation types. Then,the dynamic NudgeRank Knowledge Graph at time is defined byG = {(,,)|, E, R}, where E = U I E and a triplet(,,) represents a relationship from head node to tail node that exists at time . For example, the triplet (1,_,1) isan edge in the graph indicating that user 1 is in segment 1. Eachnode in E is represented by a -dimensional embedding vectore R, and each relation in R is represented by a -dimensionalembedding vector r R.For initial training, all node and relation embeddings are initial-ized using Xavier initialization . When the model is subsequentlyfine-tuned on new data, the node and relation embeddings of graphG+1 are first initialized using the previously learned embeddingsfrom graph G, except for any new nodes or relations where Xavierinitialization was applied.The NudgeRank model () uses attentive graph convolu-tion layers to aggregate node embeddings from neighboring nodes,so that the GNN can learn which neighbors are most importantfor passing information to personalize the nudges. The number oflayers and the dimensions of each layer are hyperparameters thatcan be tuned. The embeddings for head node in layer are up-dated by the attention-weighted linear combination of its first orderneighbors N in layer 1, aggregated with its own embeddingsvia a differentiable function , e.g. addition or concatenation.",
  ", = e e(4)": "3.1.3Constraints Filter. After the RecSys has ranked the candidatenudges for each user, the Constraints Filter applies customizable cri-teria to refine the nudge selection, aiming to optimize engagementwhile mitigating fatigue. For example, a nudge budget (maximumnumber of nudges per day) is applied to minimize nudge fatigue;nudges that were sent recently (e.g. last 7 days) are removed toincrease the diversity of nudges in consecutive days; nudges that auser had rated \"not useful\" are removed to reduce annoyance. Allof these nudges are fully configurable according to the businessneeds of the health program. 3.1.4Content Personalizer. The Content Personalizer processes thefinal list of selected nudges for each user, and renders any personal-ized fields in the nudge template. For example, the following nudgetemplate \"Great job walking {{avg_daily_steps}} daily steps last week!You are getting pretty close to your goal of 10,000 steps per day!\"is rendered with the users actual data (e.g. \"8,356 daily steps\") topersonalize the nudge for that user. 3.1.5NudgeAPI. Finally, the nudges are exposed via NudgeAPI toexternal delivery channels such as mobile apps or email deliverysystems. Feedback data in the form of nudge engagement (sent,opened, ratings) are collected, along with health behavior and vi-tals from fitness trackers and other smart devices. As new datais ingested, they create a continuous feedback loop with updatedcontextual information for the next set of personalized nudges tobe generated.",
  "Deploying a RecSys at scale requires careful design to solve opera-tional issues that can occur in a production system. This sectiondescribes the critical design considerations for NudgeRank": "3.2.1Personalization and Contextualization. The main job of aRecSys for health nudges is to deliver personalized nudges that arerelevant and contextual to the users health state, goals and behav-iors, so that the user remains engaged with the health programand adheres to the desired positive health behaviors. NudgeRankachieves a high level of personalization by considering what to say,who to send a nudge to, and when to send it.What: the Nudge Library allows a wide variety of nudges tobe written, using different nudge techniques, choice of words, ortonalities. Since different users may find different nudges to be inter-esting, NudgeRank can learn the preferences of individual usersand recommend other similar nudges. For example, some usersmay have a competitive personality and respond better to nudgesthat challenge them with social comparisons to peer groups, whileothers respond better to gentle reminders. Furthermore, nudges canbe written as templates that allow the content to be personalizedby injecting the users own contextual data into the message, asdescribed in .1.4.Who: The program manager can write nudges for different audi-ences by specifying the target segments for each nudge. For example,different nudges can be written for young adults who are sedentaryvs. active. Segments can be defined by static user attributes like de-mographics, and dynamic attributes like health behaviors. A userssegment memberships are dynamic and automatically updated, astheir health states and behaviors change daily. As a result, the list ofcandidate nudges that the user may receive is also contextual andup-to-date. For example, suppose the user belongs to the \"InactiveYoung Adult\" segment on day 1, and gets a nudge reminding theuser to exercise. On day 2, the user goes to the gym and moves toanother segment called \"Active Young Adult\"; the user receives adifferent nudge saying, \"Good job, keep it up!\" Segments can bedefined as broadly or precisely as required; for example, nudges canbe written for all \"Young Adults\", or only \"Prediabetic OverweightModerately Active Young Males\". As users perform different health",
  "RESULTS": "We evaluated NudgeRank in a large-scale deployment in Sin-gapore, in collaboration with HPB. The system was launched inproduction in July 2022 as part of several beta tests involving se-lected users. In July 2023, the system was launched for all users,and has since been generating personalized nudges for over 1.1million users daily. All users had previously given consent for theirfitness data to be collected via the Healthy 365 mobile app, andfor their data to be used to send personalized messages, nudges ornotifications, and for evaluation of results.The system was deployed in HPBs Azure cloud environment,with all data required for model updates and generating recom-mendations remaining in the secure cloud environment. A 10-nodeKubernetes cluster was used, with each node having 16 vCPUs and128 GB RAM. Data was stored in Azure Data Lake Gen2, a cloudstorage service supporting blobs in a hierarchical namespace.With input from business requirements, the system was con-figured with the following parameters (described above): = 8, = 1, = 0.3, and _ = 7.",
  "In the first limited beta phase, nudges were sent to about 100,000randomly selected users for a period of 4 months, and the interaction": "data were collected to tune the hyperparameters of the model. Thefollowing hyperparameters were evaluated using a grid search: thedimension size of entity and relation embeddings, and the numberof graph convolution layers and their respective embedding sizesof the hidden layers. For each combination of hyperparameters, themodel was trained on the knowledge graph with 25% of user-nudgeinteractions randomly hidden, and tested on the knowledge graphincluding those 25% unseen interactions.We theorized that behavior change via nudging starts with sim-ply interacting with the nudges by opening or rating them. Themore nudges are opened, the more likely it is that users have readthem, and therefore make a choice about their behaviors. Therefore,offline evaluation focused on the models ability to recommendtop 3 daily nudges that users were most likely to interact with.@3 was chosen as the primary evaluation metric, since itrepresents the proportion of the 3 recommended nudges that leadto user interaction. shows the list of parameters tested, with the parametercombination that produced the best offline evaluation score of@3 = 0.0652. This parameter combination was set upin the system for subsequent nudge recommendations. compares this with the best-performing parameter combinationsfor 1-, 2- and 3-layer models. The 2-layer model achieved the highest@3; notably, this is 0.0201 (45%) higher than the 1-layermodel that serves as a baseline for comparison.After nudges were rolled out at full scale, we added more metrics(, @3 and @3), and continuedto monitor the offline metrics during daily incremental model up-dates. The screenshot in was captured from the systemsmonitoring dashboards, showing that model metrics experienceddaily fluctuations within fairly tight ranges. The standard devia-tions of the metrics ranged from 0.00684 for @3 to 0.00996for @3 over the 4 month period from August 2023 to Novem-ber 2023, indicating that model performance was fairly stable overtime.",
  "Impact of Nudging on Physical Activity": "Arguably the most important outcome to evaluate is whether NudgeR-ank is effective at improving health behaviors via nudging. Weevaluated this over a 12-week period, where daily personalizednudges were sent to = 84, 764 randomly selected users of theHealthy 365 mobile app, to encourage them to do more physicalactivity including steps and MVPA. A matched control group of = 84, 903 users with the same demographics (age and sex) andbaseline behaviors (mean steps and MVPA before nudging) werealso selected to compare the effect of nudging. Users in the controlgroup did not get any personalized nudges.Over the 12-week period, users who received daily personalizednudges performed 6.17% more average daily steps and 7.61% moreaverage weekly minutes of MVPA than users who did not receiveany nudges. These results were statistically significant at = 0.05on one-tailed independent samples t-tests comparing both groups(). When the behaviors of the nudge and no nudge groupswere measured on a weekly basis for each of the 12 weeks, theyremained significantly different for all 12 weeks for steps, and 10",
  "Weekly MVPA47.050.6 (+7.61%)1.16 102": "out of 12 weeks for MVPA, suggesting that behavior differenceswere sustained and persistent.Participants who opened more nudges were also found to havebeen more physically active. For example, participants who opened0, 1, 2 and 3 nudges during the 12 weeks walked a mean of2,491, 3,213, 3,588 and 4,445 daily steps, respectively. This suggestsa positive relationship between nudge engagement and behavior.Furthermore, nudges were generally well received. A total of1.12 million nudges sent during this period, comprising 660,000nudges to encourage steps and 460,000 nudges for MVPA. 13.1% of all nudges were opened, out of which, 6 times more nudges wererated useful (11.7%) than not useful (1.9%) by users.Appendix reports more representative results from this study onthe impact of nudges on physical activity; for full coverage, see .",
  "System Scalability and Performance": "On a daily basis, the production system generates nudges for over1 million users. The typical size of the knowledge graph (which hassmall daily fluctuations) is reported in . In order to ensurethat nudges are generated in time to be sent each day, a perfor-mance test was conducted to evaluate how total execution timeincreases with the number of candidate nudges that need to beranked. Synthetic data was created to generate a larger number ofcandidate user-nudge pairs than was available in the productionsystem, ranging from 300 thousand to 19 billion candidate pairs. Foreach set of candidate nudges, the system was executed with 8 paral-lel batches, with each batch process running on a Kubernetes nodewith 16 vCPUs and 128GB RAM. The total end-to-end executiontime of Parallel NudgeRank (Algorithm 1) was recorded.",
  ": Results of execution time versus volume of candi-date user-nudge pairs to be scored": "The results in show a strong correlation (2 = 0.9997)between the number of candidate user-nudge pairs and the totalexecution time of the system. Scoring 300 thousand candidate pairson the tested infrastructure took 22 minutes. This grew linearly to138 minutes to score 19 billion candidate pairs. The results indicatethat the system is able to scale linearly to process increased demandof future workloads. Furthermore, the parallel design of the systemmakes it trivial to reduce the overall execution time, by addingmore compute resources to the cluster.Daily model updates were also computationally efficient in theproduction system, with the Model Trainer taking between 90 and150 minutes to update the model with the latest daily knowledgegraph. The variation in time was mainly due to the different numberof epochs required by the model to converge, as data inputs changedday to day. The short time required for model update allows it tobe scheduled daily, during system off-peak hours.At the time of writing, the system has been running daily forover 18 months, indicating the high level of reliability achieved inits design.",
  "DISCUSSION": "We presented the design and implementation results of a production-scale RecSys for digital algorithmic nudging, and demonstrated theability of the NudgeRank system to not only improve health be-haviors, but also to do it at scale for a large population, and with ahigh level of performance and reliability. Although the system wasfirst evaluated on physical activity (steps and MVPA), it is designed to be easily deployed for any other use cases where it is importantto influence users health behaviors, for example, diabetes man-agement, nutrition, sleep, smoking cessation, pre- / post-operativecare, and many others.The system was launched to users in a progressive rollout, start-ing with fewer users and gradually increasing to the full user baseover a period of 12 months. This allowed the system to be moni-tored and improved in iterations to address operational issues. Forexample, Parallel NudgeRank (Algorithm 1) was developed inresponse to the increased load, as nudges were enabled for moreusers. The monitoring dashboards that recorded model performanceand nudge engagement provided useful real-time insights into thesystems daily operations for observability and troubleshooting.A number of future improvements are under development. Re-inforcement Learning can be used to provide goal-directed recom-mendations, where nudges are based not only on user preferences,but also consider the \"next best action\" that a user should taketowards stated health goals. The Knowledge Graph can be updatedwith more node and edge types, providing richer context for per-sonalized recommendations. Large Language Models can be usedto enrich the graph with semantic information, for example aboutnudge content, as well as add external knowledge about relevanthealth topics.This work is just the first step in improving population-levelhealth behaviors through personalization. As the future iterationsof the system bring new capabilities and the system is deployedand evaluated on other health use cases and different populations,there is tremendous potential to effect sustained behavior changeat scale, leading to meaningful improvements in population healthoutcomes.",

Healthy 365 is alsoused by over 1.1 million participants in Eat Drink Shop Healthy(EDSH), its program to encourage better nutrition via healthy foodpurchases 1.Traditionally, mass marketing efforts such as roadshows, broad-casts and social media were the main channels of engagement toencourage active participation in these programs. As part of a betalaunch of NudgeRank integrated with Healthy 365, a study wasconducted to evaluate the impact of digital algorithmic nudging onphysical activity behavior such as steps and MVPA.",
  "A.2Study Design": "An A/B test was conducted to evaluate the impact of nudgingover 12 weeks versus no nudging on subsequent steps and MVPAbehavior. A total of 169,667 users were randomly selected fromthe existing pool of NSC participants, which comprised 14,901participants who were only enrolled in NSC (Group 1), and 154,766who were enrolled in both NSC and EDSH (Group 2). Because theunderlying characteristics of these groups were different, they wereanalyzed as two separate groups to ensure fair comparison of results.Each group of participants were further split into two cohorts whoof roughly equal size, and equally matched on key characteristicsincluding demographics, baseline behaviors (before the start ofnudging), mobile OS, and brand of fitness trackers. These cohortswere named \"Nudges\" and \"No Nudges\". summarizes thenumber of participants and their characteristics in each group andcohort.HPB subject matter experts authored a total of 96 nudges in theNudge Library, comprising 31 nudges targeting steps as the behaviorgoal, and 65 targeting MVPA. During the 12-week study period,NudgeRank generated 1 nudge per day for participants in the\"Nudges\" groups only, which were delivered via push notificationsto Healthy 365 mobile app. Participants in the \"No Nudges\" groupsdid not receive any nudges.All participants continued to be exposed to the usual commu-nications and mass marketing efforts conducted by the respectiveprograms. Besides the experimental variable of nudges versus nonudges, there were no other differences in how they were treated.The daily steps and MVPA behavior of participants were col-lected during the 12 week study via Healthy 365, to evaluate theimpact of nudging on those behaviors. One-tailed independent sam-ples -tests were performed to evaluate the differences between the\"Nudges\" and \"No Nudges\" groups.",
  "A.3Results": "During the 12-week period, a total of 1.12 million nudges weresent, achieving an open rate of 13.1% (147k nudges), which wassignificantly higher than existing baseline open rates of about 4%.Out of the nudges opened, 6 times more nudges were rated useful(11.7%) versus not useful (1.9%), suggesting that the nudges werevery well received by participants.The behavior data collected revealed a significant impact ofdigital nudging in increasing physical activity. Group 1 \"Nudges\"participants performed 6.17% more daily steps (3,088 vs. 2,909 steps; = 3.09 104 and 7.61% more weekly minutes of MVPA (50.6vs. 47.0 minutes; = 1.16 102) than Group 1 \"No Nudges\"participants. The results were statistically significant at = 0.05,indicating that the nudges were effective in increasing both stepsand MVPA behavior.The effects on Group 2 participants, though smaller, were still sta-tistically significant at = 0.05. Group 2 \"Nudges\" participants per-formed 1.89% more daily steps (3,900 vs. 3,827 steps; = 2.85104)and 2.46% more weekly minutes of MVPA (88.4 vs. 86.2 minutes; = 2.02 102) than Group 2 \"No Nudges\" participants. We notedthat Group 2 participants were already naturally more physicallyactive than Group 1 participants (refer to their mean daily stepsand MVPA at start of experiment, in ), so perhaps the op-portunity to drive behavior change of a similar magnitude wassmaller.",
  ": Participants in control and treatment groups, and their characteristics": "The results also revealed a dose response relationship betweenthe number of nudges opened by \"Nudges\" participants during the12 weeks and physical activity (). Participants who openedmore nudges tended to walk more steps during the 12 weeks. ForMVPA, this relationship was more apparent in Group 1 than inGroup 2. Overall, the results of this study provided strong evidence thatalgorithmic digital nudging can effect behavior change (physicalactivity in this case) across a large and diverse population. Nudgingcan be further extended to other types of health behaviors likenutrition, sleep and smoking cessation, with the potential to drivetremendous benefits in population health outcomes."
