  "ABSTRACT": "With recent rapid growth in online shopping, AI-powered Engage-ment Surfaces (ES) have become ubiquitous across retail services.These engagement surfaces perform an increasing range of func-tions, including recommending new products for purchase, remind-ing customers of their orders and providing delivery notifications.Understanding the causal effect of engagement surfaces on valuedriven for customers and businesses remains an open scientificquestion. In this paper, we develop a dynamic causal model at scaleto disentangle value attributable to an ES, and to assess its effec-tiveness. We demonstrate the application of this model to informbusiness decision-making by understanding returns on investmentin the ES, and identifying product lines and features where the ESadds the most value.",
  "INTRODUCTION": "Causal frameworks are a powerful tool to provide actionable in-sights into complex business problems. Businesses can make data-driven decisions by understanding cause-and-effect relationships tomaximize efficiency and allocate resources better. There has beenan increased effort in both academic research and industry to usecausal inference for informed decision-making and to measure eco-nomic impact. This work has led to the development of open source",
  "Both authors contributed equally to this work": "packages such CausalML for uplift modeling in marketing cam-paigns, PyWhy for causal reasoning and evaluating interven-tions, and EconML for estimating heterogeneous treatmenteffects in customer segments. Large organizations require accuratemeasurement of long-term causal impacts to calculate the returnson their investments correctly. Reliable and scalable strategies todo this are therefore increasingly important.The share of online shopping has steadily grown around theworld. In the US, the percentage of online shopping has grownfrom less than 1% in 2000 to around 15% in 2023 . Providing thebest shopping experience for online customers is therefore a highpriority for retail businesses around the world. Combined with de-velopments in artificial intelligence (AI), this has led to the creationof Engagement Surfaces (ES). An ES is any application, feature, wid-get (or collection thereof) that is intended to help customers savetime, reduce shopping effort, and support new product discovery.Almost all prominent e-commerce companies have sophisticatedES to improve customer shopping experiences. Additionally, thereare some companies that offer integration of an engagement surfaceas a service to online sellers . Depending on the level of sophis-tication, an ES typically performs one or more of the followingfunctions.",
  "Answer customer questions Track orders and returns": "Despite the prevalence and sophistication of ES, it is unclear exactlyhow much this has enhanced customer experience, and how thathas translated into revenue for the business. The economic rationalefor ES hinges primarily on the use of an ES leading to increasedcustomer spend and interactions with monetizable features in themedium to long run. However, causally attributing increase in sales",
  "Mukerji et al": "This generates a summary of the model using the baseline and re-alized levels 0 and for each business in this case. Put differently,Shapley attributions are averages of these marginal contributions for each input . Since there are many possible combinations of businesses being active (i.e., part of the coalition) or inactive, Shap-ley attributions serve as a way to compress these many potentialoutcomes into a single value. If the Shapley attribution value fora business is close to zero it indicates that its average returns aresmall irrespective of other inputs.",
  "DYNAMIC CAUSAL MODEL": "We developed a Dynamic Causal Model (DCM) to identify medi-ated causal effects and interactions in high dimensions over a longperiod of time in order to generate interesting aggregate businesscounterfactual analyses. One such example would be estimating theoverall causal effect of removal of specific product lines or features.This model was developed in part to avoid some of the limitationsof binary treatment effect estimation of a single customer action. The DCM models the interaction across time periods betweenall model variables and outcomes of interest (typically customerspending or revenue generated). We refer to variables capturingcustomer interactions with the shopping interface as surrogates following terminology in econometrics for short-term observedfeatures associated with longer-term outcomes of interest. Theseare typically structured to identify customer behavior such as pur-chases and new program sign ups. The dynamic framework offers numerous advantages, notably by allowing treatment effects inone period to impact subsequent surrogates, generating cascadingspillover effects, and leading to mediated causal pathways that areimportant to account for. Moreover, such a structure also enablesjoint-policy evaluation, where we can consider complex counter-factual scenarios where a large group of causal pathways may beblocked off, attenuated or enhanced. Finally, we resolve the issueof evaluating the combined impact of different surrogates, whichcould be double counted or incorrectly aggregated if being studiedthrough separate binary interventions, as is usually the case inonline A/B testing.The DCM framework models hundreds of customer surrogates/actionsover time and parametrizes the associations between them.",
  ": DCM Causal Graph: 3-period example. The solidarrows represent direct relationships. The dashed arrow rep-resent indirect (mediated) relationships": "shows a simplified 3-period example to explain the key elements ofthe model. We measure the relationship between surrogate 1 andsurrogate from = 1 to = 2 (solid arrow), but can also observethe relationship between surrogate 1 and surrogate from = 1 to = 3 (dashed arrow), and vice versa between surrogate and sur-rogate 1. The surrogate variables help isolate the possible channelsthrough which a causal effect propagates over time to outcomesor other surrogates. This allows us to quantify how surrogates ata particular point in time affect other surrogates or outcomes infuture periods. A major advantage of such a model is that we prop-erly capture mediated effects, where changes in a surrogate at apoint in time continue to generate ripple effects in future periodsthrough interactions with subsequent surrogate variables.The model estimates a set of equations which capture surrogateinteractions as described above. The solution strategy we employestimates these associations and then simulates counterfactualsthat capture the state of the ecosystem at any point in time (oracross time) when specific input surrogates are shocked. A shockhere refers to a scenario where a surrogate (or a group of surro-gates) is increased/decreased (or set to zero) for a point in time, orover a period of time. The model propagates this shock through thedynamic system of equations and then aggregates the effects to gen-erate a counterfactual (i.e., under the shocked condition) measurethat can be used to compute outcomes of interest across a chosen",
  "Valuing an Engagement Surface using a Large Scale Dynamic Causal Model": "period. Surrogates can be configured to represent product lines orentire businesses, and the model can therefore capture the effect ofshutting down this group of customer behaviors. The DCM is animprovement over the causal impact estimation framework for asingle customer action . It is able to handle overlapping inter-actions amongst customer events and provides a way to estimatelong term causal effects in a scientifically disciplined way.",
  "DCM Training": "While non-linear versions of the DCM are possible to construct,we define for this application a partially linear model to evaluatean outcome with respect to binary policy , and define to bethe surrogate variable which captures the impact of any exogenouspolicy change attributed to . (.) and (.) represent functionscontrolling for variation attributable to pre-determined customerfeatures 0. A customers surrogate and revenue values at time are defined by",
  "=0, + (0) + + (1)": "where ,, ,,, are the coefficients to be learned during modeltraining. and are zero-mean noise terms.Note that Eqs. (1) are modeled per customer . We omit thesubscript for simplicity of exposition. The DCM framework in-ternally uses a scalable regression algorithm to estimate hundredsof regressions in Apache Spark . It works with a JSON inputconfiguration which keeps it modular and flexible. Importantly, wemodel customer actions and outcomes at a given time period asa function of that customers lagged actions. That is, the baselinemodel uses only past behavior on the right hand side of the re-gression. The reason for this is that the model consumes data in apanel format, and since we do not use timestamp-level information,we cannot disentangle the causal direction of actions that occurin the same time period. As we discuss in , this can ne-glect intra-period effects that could be relevant for modeling ES we overcome this by imposing some additional restrictions on thecausal graph implied by the DCM.",
  "DCM Scoring": "The second aspect of the framework involves the simulation toolthat uses the trained model parameters to predict potential out-comes under alternate scenarios. Counterfactuals for business orproduct line elimination scenarios are computed by defining shocksthat change the outcomes of interest (e.g. customer spending/ unitsales) and surrogates that belong to that specific business by a per-centage amount. These shocks are applied in a sequential mannerbecause of which the dynamic structure cannot be solved in thegeneral case without recursion. For example, we simulate counter-factuals in the above setup of Eq. (1) as follows:",
  "Business Motivation": "Revisiting , we note that the standard DCM framework cap-tures lagged causal effects (cause preceding the effect) on futuresurrogates and outcomes at least one time unit apart. In practice,the DCM framework is implemented using a weekly time grain.That is, we aggregate activity for each customer on a weekly basisand model Eqs. (1). Returning to the business use case of ES, wenote that an important value-add arises from friction reduction forcustomers making purchases. As a result, value driven by the ESis likely associated with near-simultaneous customer actions (e.g.,when a customer engages with the ES to obtain information aboutan item, adds it to cart, and completes their purchase in the samehour). Since the DCM operates using data at a coarse time grain,we refer to such actions as contemporaneous or same-periodactions. The DCM enhancement discussed here is important as itensures that we properly attribute customer actions in the sameperiod, mediated through the ES, towards its valuation. Note, giventhe DCM structure, we regard any customer actions in that sametime period (e.g., week) as being simultaneous from a causal per-spective.To explain the intuition behind the same-period effects modulein our DCM, we consider a simple case with two businesses, the ES,and business A1, and two time periods. Both businesses are assumedto be represented by a single surrogate, and the outcome of interest(revenue in this example) is realized in the second period (withT=1 as a pre-period of lagged surrogates for illustration). Thecausal graph corresponding to this conventional/standard causalrelationship in DCM is shown in the left panel in .If we modify this structure to incorporate same-period effects,our model now captures how events in a particular time periodproduce causal impact on other events and outcomes in that sametime period. This is designed to account for the near-simultaneouscause and effect relationships such as those posited for an ES. Inthis example with same-period effects, any near-simultaneous (andtherefore within one week/day/our minimum time grain) interac-tions with the ES that lead to a purchase transaction are attributedto have been caused by the ES. Returning to the causal graph in, we allow for additional causal links (represented by greendashed arrows) in the panel on the right. This enables the model to",
  ": Simplified representation of the DCM causal graph with and without the same-period effects": "learn associations between outcomes/surrogates of interest and ESinteractions in that same time period. We note that this requiresspecifying the direction of the causal link as an identification as-sumption, which in the case of the ES is assumed to run from the ESsurrogate this is a necessity given the fidelity available with thistime grain. That is, in the case of near-simultaneous events, we givethe ES credit for driving the causal effect. This is reasonable in thecase of an ES driving a revenue outcome, but would lead to misspec-ification if ES interactions are in fact driven by actions/surrogatesin other businesses in the same period. Given that the ES functionsas a friction reducer for customers engaging in purchase behavior,we expect this latter case is relatively infrequent with muted biasinduced in measured treatment effects as a result. Despite thesepotential limitations, we choose to account for same-period effectswithin the DCM framework to allow for ease of use and repeatedanalyses, rather than using an auxiliary model to obtain contempo-raneous incrementality inputs. One of our ongoing enhancementsto this framework relies on using short term A/B testing to learnthe direction of causal links and adjusting the regression structureaccordingly.In the next section, we provide the mathematical details of theframework to include the contemporaneous effects in the DCM.",
  "Mathematical Framework": "Let us denote as the complete set of surrogates. Let be thesurrogates specifying the interactions with the ES and be thenon-ES surrogates. So, = and = {}.Based on the business context discussed in Sec. 3.1 and takingmotivation from the literature discussing vector autoregressionmodels , we update the standard DCM equations from Eq. (1)as follows:",
  "Non-ES surrogates cannot cause any surrogate/outcomein the same period. This is the standard DCM temporalconstraint to avoid causal loops": "ES interactions of one type cannot cause ES interactionsof another type in the same period. This is indicated byequation for only having the lagged surrogates on theRHS.To generalize to other business cases, we would allow sameperiod causal effects from the business of interest onto any surro-gate/outcome subject to restrictions based on business knowledgeof the direction of causality (eg. actions cause outcomes but notvice versa). We are currently working on improving this throughcausal graph discovery in the same period, that would allow themodel to learn the appropriate causal directionality and imposethese constraints in the regression structure.In the next section we give an overview of the implementationof the same-period DCM model for the ES use case.",
  "(2) We also analyze the weekly participation of the same sampleof customers in the standard surrogates (denoted by in Eq. (2)). We have about 2000 such surrogates today torepresent customer behavior": "(3) To the above two, we join the weekly interactions of thecustomers with the ES. As mentioned in Sec. 1, customersinteract with the ES in multiple ways. We worked withbusiness partners to consolidate the different customer in-teractions into feature groups. These are denoted by inEq. (2). The ES we are working with operates in three broadchannels, and we analyze the customer participation in ESfeature groups of interest across all these three channels.",
  "(4) Based on the historical surrogate/ interaction feature par-ticipation data and the historical spend, we learn the coeffi-cients in Eqs. (3)-(5)": "(5) Once the model has been trained, to estimate the valueof a certain ES channel or feature we use the model toconstruct the counterfactual scenario where the specifiedES channel/feature is unavailable to customers. This is donethrough dynamic model scoring as described in Sec. 2.2. In Appendix A, we discuss some nuances related to DCM trainingand scoring while incorporating same-period effects. We note thatinclusion of same-period effects has no impact on computationalefficiency or model run time.",
  "Shapley Attribution": "The DCM framework also allows us to apply attribution algorithmsto business valuations. This becomes relevant when estimating themodel for multiple businesses that jointly generate value to ensurethat value is not being double counted. An important applicationof such valuations for business stakeholders is in sizing financialinvestments and optimizing product selection. To do this effectively,we needed to develop the capability to structure model output fordirect comparison with financial accounts. In other words, valua-tions produced by the DCM framework should tally with revenuereported in financial statements. Shapley Attribution is ourdefault method of doing this, and is effectively based on a weightedaverage of how much a business contributes when it is added to agroup of other active businesses at the margin, across all combina-tions. In the case of ES valuation, this allows us to understand themarginal contribution to different product lines given the invest-ment required to support ES tooling. More details regarding thisare provided in Appendix B.",
  "System Architecture Overview": "showcases the current system architecture of the DCMframework. The framework has been developed using modularcomponents in order to prioritize ease of maintenance and scal-ability. There is minimal dependency between modules enablingfaster, parallel development cycles and reducing downtime if cer-tain components need to be updated. We emphasize adaptability toa wide range of use cases, and interpretability (transparent insightsthat help us understand what is driving any result). The model isimplemented in Apache Spark, and is structured with a pipelinedesign pattern that processes data in a series of stages, with eachstage performing specific operations on the data. We build custom SparkML pipelines using Transformers and Estimators in Sparkas required. An added advantage is that the inherited serializationand deserialization persist when loading the fitted models. Thisdesign pattern avoids any replication of code in training/scoringorchestration or manual configuration changes to map with trainedmodels.The DCM framework utilizes a stateless design function wheremodel training and scoring are designed to be independent stages.The scoring input can be processed by using a training pipelinewithout requiring any further context or other state information.This simplifies the parameters needed during inference and en-ables easy broadcast of functions/parameters to enable distributedscoring.Experimentation at high velocity is another key feature of theframework. We achieved this by creating batch tooling that is pow-ered through AWS Lambda to execute multiple parallel in-ference runs. The base model configuration can be overridden inparallel runs that spin up and terminate clusters after completion.All artifacts are logged into MLFlow enabling easy trackingof experiments, reproduction of model results, and sharing modelruns across different users. The linear model structure enables usto disentangle the effect of each surrogate variable on outcomesand other surrogates, and recovering coefficient values allows us tointerpret causal effects and provide insights on customer behavior.The DCM model uses the MLFlow model registry to log models thatcan be read back to examine the learned weights. Additionally, theframework allows for confidence interval estimation on valuationsthrough bootstrapped runs. The ES model runs use 100 millioncustomers analyzed over 3 years at a weekly grain, with over 2000features per time period.This has been possible using PySpark and SparkML Trans-formers and Estimators and utilizing sparse vectors for data com-pression. Another optimization that we added is in-memory cre-ation of lagged features used on the RHS of Eq. (1). We score themodel linearly across time periods, using the input scoring dataand the trained model pipeline. This iterative autoregressive ap-proach is suboptimal given Sparks lazy computation, which relieson creating dynamic plans first and then executing the computationgraph. This leads to slow execution time, as the computation graphbecomes intractably huge. To overcome this, we utilized check-pointing to break the lineage in the computation graph and forceperiodic calculation.",
  "RESULTS": "In this section we discuss our main results, estimating the valuegenerated by the ES using the DCM framework. We provide valua-tions for individual ES channels as well as the overall valuation. Weanonymize the channel names to preserve business confidentiality.Note that the total ES value is not a simple sum of individual chan-nels because some of the value of each channel is jointly determinedwith other channels (i.e., the incremental value of each channel isaffected by the presence of other channels).The ES generates value by improving customer satisfaction lead-ing to increased engagement and purchases. Along with the totalincremental spend across all channels (which corresponds to thetotal ES value), we also look at different slices across the three ES",
  ": DCM framework architecture with training and scoring stages": "channels and the different product groups that ES facilitates shop-ping for. Numbers in answer questions like How muchrevenue would have been lost in each of the product groups in thefull year 2022 if the ES was not available in a certain channel?Product groups are broad categories such as grocery, electronics,apparel etc. Looking at the value for different product groups al-lows us to gain insights into whether the ES adds more value inone category versus another. To maintain business confidentiality,we scale all numbers in through between 0 and 100by normalizing with the total estimated causal value for the ES. Ad-ditionally, we also anonymize the product group names, channelsand features. The key insights from our results are as follows: 1. Top channel drives over 50% of ES value: Based on , wesee that the highest monetary value for ES comes from Channel 2.This is consistent with the idea that this was a channel with broaderreach driving the most customer engagement and hence the mostmonetary value. We also produced bootstrap confidence bounds toquantify sampling error. These bounds are generally quite narrow,even at the product group level (typically within 5-7% of the pointestimate). 2. The ES drives the highest value in low average selling price (ASP)and regular purchase categories: When looking at the incrementalimpact of ES interactions on the different product group categories,we notice that over 85% of them are from low ASP and frequentpurchase categories. Examples includes categories such as babyproducts, beauty products, apparel, and grocery. Customers maybe more interested in engaging with the ES for products that aremore regularly purchased, where Q&A (to gather product infor-mation) and price checks are more useful, and where a customerstime investment in product selection and search is less beneficial.Our findings are overall consistent with our intuition given thenature of ES features: friction-reduction customer experience (inthe current form available) drives the most value in product groupsthat customers are likely already familiar with, or that are morefrequent and/or low ASP buys for which customers perceive less",

Top two features drive 73% of ESs impact: We also estimated thevalue lost if specific ES interaction features (such as those offeringtracking or product information) were not available. showsvaluations for each interaction feature for the ES as a whole, as wellas broken out by the different channels. The effects in this tableare not strictly additive, but still helps us identify the major valuedriving features. We observe that the bulk of the value (over 73%)comes from the top two feature categories. These feature categoriesare associated with re-buys and finding product information. Giventhat most of the ES value is driven by low-ASP/ regularly purchasedproducts, it is reasonable that features supporting efficient repeatorders and product information provision are important for the ES. 4. Near-simultaneity of ES interaction and purchases plays a largerole in value driven: As mentioned in Sec. 3, we updated the stan-dard DCM model to better capture causal flows between the ES andother customer actions in the same time period (one week in themodel specification we used). The output from the model whichdoes not include the same-period effects is shown in . Forease of interpretation, shows the difference in incrementalrevenue between and . This captures the value thatwe would have missed had we not properly accounted for same-period effects in the DCM. We were previously concerned thatomitting these same-period effects would result in undervaluationof the ES. Indeed, when we disable same-period effects, we esti-mate that the value of the ES is 25% smaller. Comparing the threechannels, the impact of same-period effects is again intuitive. Theimpact is larger in channels where the customers are most likelyto complete purchases within a shorter time frame. In , weprovide the contribution of same-period effects to the individualfeature valuations. Comparing this to , we notice that for cer-tain features over 25% of the valuation comes from the same-periodeffects. This again underscores the importance of incorporatingsame-period effects when valuing customer-initiated upper-funnelactions such as those produced through ES interaction.",
  "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK": "In this work, we introduced a Dynamic Causal Model (DCM) whichhelps us identify the causal effect of a business under consider-ation, on value generated for the company. The strength of themodel lies in its ability to extract causal insights in a fundamentallymultivariate scenario with complex interdependencies. The DCMachieves this by modeling interactions between thousands of cus-tomer actions over several years. The recursive dynamic scoringapproach allows us to construct interesting business counterfactu-als by \"shocking\" (changing and projecting based on the model) therelevant outcomes and surrogates. The modular implementationusing Apache Spark allows us to scale, and our pipeline architectureenables flexibility in analyzing different use cases efficiently.We applied the DCM framework to evaluate the value generatedby an Engagement Surface (ES). Companies leveraging ES hope toprovide a better shopping journey for online customers. However,the only way an ES generates value is by increased spending amongthe customers that interact with ES. DCM provides a principledcausal framework to estimate this value. Absent such a model,analysts studying the financial value proposition would run therisk of neglecting to account for selection bias and mediated effects,and to properly control for other predictive surrogates.We noted that since the ES acts as a friction reducer for customersmaking purchases, the value driven by the ES depends on nearsimultaneous or same-period customer actions. We discussed ourimprovements to the DCM framework to account for the effectsof these same-period actions. We found that failing to include thesame-period effects underestimates the total ES value by 25%. TheES value is more affected by same-period effects in the channelswhere customers are likely to complete purchases within a shortertime frame. Our work also sheds light on certain interesting aspects of cus-tomer behavior when it comes to engaging with an ES. We observedthat customers are more interested in engaging with the ES we ex-amine for products that are more regularly purchased, have a lowerASP, and where customers time investment in product selection isless beneficial. We also demonstrated the versatility of our frame-work through its ability to obtain the value driven by individualES features groups. Modifying the shocks allows us to constructcounterfactuals of interest and thereby study the value created bythe ES across arbitrary segments.Causal-based valuations like the ones we provided drive im-portant long-term capital allocation decisions. They are especiallychallenging to obtain when there are multiple businesses within anorganization and these business create value by supporting otherbusiness directly or indirectly. While we focus here on the use caseof valuing an ES, we emphasize that our framework is flexible andcan be leveraged for valuing any business or feature set of interest.",
  "Future Work": "6.1.1Validation. One of the challenges in validating observationalcausal estimates is summarized by the Fundamental Problem ofCausal Inference . The lack of observable ground truth makes itdifficult to validate the output of a causal model. Businesses oftenuse online RCTs for individual feature launch decisions. A naiveway to obtain total value from RCTs is through rolling up estimatesacross different experiments. The major flaw with such bespokesummation is that RCTs are often sequential tests of individualfeature improvements rather than holdouts of the entire customerexperience that a program (such as the Engagement Surface inour example) offers. There are also secondary issues related todifferential timing of the impact of RCTs, sequencing of treatments,and the role of long-term effects when annualizing short termexperimental evidence.Building an apples-to-apples technique of comparing valuationsfrom the DCM model to RCT-based valuations is part of our ongoingwork. 6.1.2Non-linear functional form. In its current form, the DCMframework accounts for interdependencies among different cus-tomer action through a system of linear equations (e.g., Eq. (1)). Theuse of linear system makes our framework easier to interpret andhelps with building confidence in results through its transparency.It also speeds up the computation. We had previously noted that",
