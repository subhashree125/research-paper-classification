  "ABSTRACT": "Online retailers often use third-party demand-side-platforms (DSPs)to conduct offsite advertising and reach shoppers across the Inter-net on behalf of their advertisers. The process involves the retailerparticipating in instant auctions with real-time bidding for each adslot of their interest. In this paper, we introduce a bid optimizationsystem that leverages the dimensional bidding function provided bymost well-known DSPs for Walmart offsite display ad campaigns.The system starts by automatically searching for the optimal seg-mentation of the ad requests space based on their characteristics(e.g. geo location, device type). Then, it assesses the quality of im-pressions observed from each dimension based on revenue signalsdriven by the campaign effect. During the campaign, the system iter-atively approximates the bid landscape based on the data observedand calculates the bid adjustments for each dimension. Finally, ahigher bid adjustment factor is applied to dimensions with poten-tially higher revenue over ad spend (ROAS), and vice versa. Theinitial A/B test results of the proposed optimization system hasshown its effectiveness of increasing the ROAS and conversion ratewhile reducing the effective cost per mille for ad serving.",

  "INTRODUCTION": "Programmatic advertising has been one of the greatest innovationsof eCommerce over a long time. By replacing much of the manualwork of managing ad inventory, negotiating prices, discoveringtargeted users, purchasing ad space, etc. between an advertiser anda publisher with automated systems, programmatic advertisingmakes the transaction much easier, secure, and efficient. It achievesthis by building an open marketplace, or sometimes called an adexchange, that enables all advertisers and publishers to trade witheach other online in real-time. Sitting at the core of the online openmarketplace is whats called a real-time bidding system, whichenables an ad opportunity to be sold via a real-time auction amongall advertisers.The real online advertising systems are more complicated thanwhats described above, and involves other parties such as demand-side-platforms (DSPs) and supply-side-platforms (SSPs) to partici-pate in RTB auctions on behalf of advertisers and publishers, respec-tively see . DSPs have been created to give ad inventorybuyers control over their programmatic campaign strategies suchas bidding prices for ad auctions, audience targeting preferences,budgeting pacing and throttling, etc, which are executed throughthe real-time bidding auction . Popular DSPs include FacebookAds Manager, Google DoubleClick, The Trade Desk, AppNexus, etc.Online retailers have been a major client of DSPs as they have hugedemand for online ads. As the eCommerce business picks up the",

In-house DSPsoffer obvious benefits such as better integration, more customizedfunctionalities, and overall more control on advertising strategies.Players in this area include but not limited to Amazon, Walmart,Apple, Alibaba, eBay, etc. In this work, we focus on the bid adjust-ment tool offered by most DSPs and discuss ways of optimizing theadjustment factors towards ROAS from the perspective of onlineretailers.",
  "BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE": "Bid optimization for display advertising in online RTB has beenstudied extensively over the years in both academia and the privatesector. RTB auctions was initially developed for sponsored searchto sell search impressions by posting a bid for user query keywords. Later on, display advertising started to employ RTB auctionsto sell an ad impression whenever it is generated by a users visit. The research topics for display advertising can be dividedinto the demand-side and the supply-side. The key issues facedon the supply side involves inventory prioritization , allocation, forecasting , etc., which are all important topics but arenot covered in todays discussion. The most important topic on thedemand-side is the design and implementation of effective biddingalgorithms. It is usually formulated as a constrained optimizationproblem where restrictions on the bid price, budget, pacing, etc. areenforced and we want to maximize metrics such as total impres-sions won (reach), total clicks, total conversions, ROAS, etc. Theoptimization can be formulated at the impression-level based on alinear programming prime-dual problem, and have a bidding algo-rithm that enables fine-grained impression valuation, and adjustsvalue-based bid according to real-time constraints . Anotherway is to employ multiplicative bidding where the effective bid-ding price is equal to the product of a base bid and multiple bidadjustments that are determined by the features of the ad request. This allows advertisers to optimize towards their metricsof interest by expressing relative valuations across a fixed set offeature combinations defined by the DSP. In this paper, we alsofollow this route and investigate how we can optimize through bidadjustments. Since the design of bidding strategies typical dependsheavily on the distribution of future winning bid values, an accuratebid landscape forecast model is critical. Wang et. al proposeddifferent bid landscape models while others such as Lang et. al discussed optimal bidding strategies when inaccurate bid landscapepredictions are present.Many online retail companies do not have the resource or theneed to build an in-house DSP that keeps track advertising oppor-tunities across the Internet (offsite). For most ad campaigns, theobjectives are usually maximizing the number of impressions de-livered (customer reach), clicks per impression (CTR), conversionrate (CVR), and revenue (e.g., ROAS) by bidding strategically oneach impression opportunity under a budget constraint. However,there is a critical gap of information collected by 3P DSP and onlineretailer themselves: DSPs collect the information about online adauction and bidding environment such as ad spend, clicks, winrate, pacing, etc. for multiple retail platforms, while retailers mainly owns the conversion and revenue signals of products sold on theirown platform, such as conversion amount, order amount, ordervalue, etc. Due to confidentiality or propriety restrictions, bothsides will only share limited information they collected, making itdifficult for bidding optimization. For example, DSPs cannot auto-matically optimize bid prices towards maximizing revenue as theydo not have revenue data. As a result, the campaign managers mustmanually adjust the bid prices using their own discretion if theywant to maximize revenue-related metrics such as ROAS. This isboth labor-intensive and inaccurate because the retail campaignmanagers may not have the detailed insights into the online auctionmarket.Despite the fact that most well-known DSPs nowadays providesoptimization features towards CTR, we found that the correlationbetween the click-based metrics and revenue is low for displaycampaigns due to their delayed effect on conversion. In general,online retailers face two major difficulties when trying to optimizebids towards ROAS. First, bid optimization w.r.t revenue relies onbid landscape prediction, a model which returns the probabilityof winning an auction given a bid price. Retailers, on the otherhand, only possesses the information of the impression they havewon, making it very difficult to estimate the bid landscape (in somecases, DSPs may choose to share win rate of the retailer at certainaggregated granularity but it is usually not sufficient for bid land-scape modeling). Second, 3P DSPs control the pacing and throttlingsystems that are completely unexposed to retailers. As a result, theeffect of any bid adjustment by online retailer is confounded by theintervention of such systems. And the patterns directly observedby retailers from their censored data of bid price, cost, revenue, etc.are often unstable if not misleading.",
  "Dimensional Bidding": "Despite not being directly supported by 3P DSPs, revenue-basedoptimization may be approximated using a dimensional biddingapproach. For example, Google Ad Manager allows campaignmanagers to apply bid adjustments for ad requests from differentsegments. Other DSPs also offer similar features. This service isusually provided through an API.The dimensional bidding API allows campaign managers to de-fine bid dimensions of the impression space and apply different bidadjustments to the impressions in different dimensions. A dimen-sion is a targeting item that one can target, block, or apply bidadjustments to. For example, they can be defined on domain, adformat, geolocation, time, device type, etc. The final bid price willbe the product of a base bid and several bid adjustment factors, asillustrated in . To use this tool, retail campaign managersneed to first define the bid dimensions. And the optimal way to dothat depends on how these adjustments would affect the campaignspend and performance. Thus, we need to understand and modelthe relationship among these key factors.Our main contributions include the following:",
  "(4) We demonstrated through A/B online test that our optimiza-tion system can achieve higher ROAS performance": "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In wefirst talk about an simple optimization framework based on disjointimpression segments. Then we introduce our main approach basedon overlapping dimensions. We also cover our bid landscape fore-cast model in this section. In we discuss different ways ofselecting dimensions and creating impression segments based oneach dimension. Various ways of evaluating the generated dimen-sions and segments are also discussed. In we cover ouronline A/B test results for the proposed bid optimization method.We conclude the paper and discuss the future work in .",
  "BID OPTIMIZATION METHODS": "In this paper we assume the ad campaign budget is given for eachline item, and the objective is to maximize ROAS for each line item.Equivalently, we want to maximize the total revenue for each lineitem under the budget constraint. Because we cannot accuratelymodel the bid landscape for reasons explained in , we willrely on a few assumptions to establish our optimization framework.Before laying out the assumptions, lets define a few quantitiesand notations. Let 0 denote the base bid price. The cost per (mille)impression (CPM) is defined as the total ad spend divided by advolume (multiply by one thousand). The revenue per (CPM) im-pression (RPM) is defined as the total attributed revenue dividedby ad volume (multiply by one thousand). Note that the amount ofattributed revenue depends on the size of the attribution window.The basic idea of our bid optimization is to divide the impressionpopulation into sub-populations, i.e., dimensions, so that the behav-iors of these sub-populations are easier to track and be exploited.Retailers usually have complete control over which dimensions touse and how sub-populations should be defined for each dimension.",
  "(3) RPM is independent from the bid price and relatively stablefor a short period of time (1-2 days)": "Display campaigns ad cost are determined by media cost (mea-sured by cost-per-mille (CPM)) plus some additional fees (usuallythey are constant or a fixed percentage). Because the bid price forimpressions under the same dimension is equal to the base bidtimes bid adjustment, CPM should increase if the bid adjustmentincreases. The second assumption is also intuitive as the numberof winning actions should also be proportional to the bid price.The last assumption on RPM says that if the dimensions are chosenbased on RPM, the average revenue we can get from each dimensionshould not depend on how much we paid for them. For example, ifan ad slot on Yahoo.com during certain prime hour in a zip coderegion usually gets amount of attributed revenue during a normalday. Despite the fluctuation in the bid landscape, the revenue weget from winning this ad slot wont change much regardless ofthe actual ad spend. In practice, the validity of this assumptiondepends on the quality of the sub-populations created, and we willdiscuss more about this in .2. The following types of data(at impression level) are used throughout the rest of this paper:",
  "(1)": "where = () is a model of our choice for impression volumefrom dimension . Without the loss of generality, we assume basebid 0 = 1. Taking a simple linear model as an example, in Eq. (2),we postulate that the total number of impressions we can winfrom dimension increases linearly with the corresponding bidadjustment factor. = () = (2) Table (1) and (2) give a concrete example of modeling the impressionvolumes using linear functions when there are 9 disjoint dimensionsdefined by geo location and websites. In the example, both geo andwebsite define 3 groups but in practice the number of groups donot need to be the same.Under the first price auction setting, 0 = . Fromthe assumptions above one can derive the following relations:",
  "2 (6)": "Suppose we divide the impression space into disjoint dimensionsand assign a unique bid adjustments to each, Eq. (6) shows that theoptimal bid adjustment for dimensions should be proportional to and equal to a fraction of budget, given by linear impressionvolume models.However, this framework has two main drawbacks. First, it mightsuffer from the curse of dimensionality. Instead of defining the bidadjustment as a product, it has a unique factor for each segment. In",
  "Optimize with Overlapping Bid Dimensions": "To address the drawbacks above, we came up with a more generalframework. Lets first look at an example. Similar to Table (1), inTable (3), we split the impression space based on two dimensions:site and geo, where 3 groups are created based on geo and 3 basedon site. However, this time instead of assigning a unique bid factorto each segment, we assign one to each group. Concretely, for group of dimension , we denote its bid factor by , as shown next tothe group labels. Instead of having 3 3 = 9 bid factors, we end upwith only 3 + 3 = 6 bid factors. This is a significant reduction in thenumber of parameters we need to keep track of. However, becausethe bid price for impressions will be determined by two bid factorsinstead of one, the modeling for the impression volume and costwill get slightly more complicated. Concretely, the bid price underthe new setting is given by",
  "= 1 2(8)": "where is one of the disjoint dimensions that corresponds to site and geo . The number of parameters under the new setup reducesfrom () to ( ).Yet we still need to define the relationship among key variablessuch as revenue, spend, bid price, etc. Without the loss of generality,let there be K dimensions and each dimension have I groups (inpractice the number of groups can be different). We still define thedimensional level spend and revenue as in .1 except now",
  "=1 = .(10)": "The same rule applies to revenue and impression volumes. Lets takean impression that belongs to website1 and Geo3 as an example.The bid price for this impression would be equal to = 0 12 23 following the notation in . Because a group from onedimension now overlaps from any group from another dimension,the impression volume , revenue , as well as the costcan be estimated based on more impressions: an entire row orcolumn in versus a single cell in . The total revenueand cost can be represented as",
  "=1 (12)": "To maximize the total revenue in E.q (11) w.r.t. the bid factors such that , we need to make a few assumptions on therelationship between impression volume and cost vs.the bid factors . In other words, we need to model the numberof impressions we can win and their average cost w.r.t. the bidadjustment factors. This is similar to the bid landscape models thatDSPs often build for campaign optimization, and they are usuallyrefreshed with high frequency (every minute or hour) based on themost recent data. Since retailers only get censored impression logfrom 3P DSPs with some delay (DSPs often share logs on a dailybasis), we will rely on a less accurate bid landscape approximation.",
  "Bid Landscape Approximation": "For CPM, since the cost of an impression is equal to media cost plusfees that are constant (or of constant percentage), it roughly equalsto a multiple of the bid price. Hence, we can use a model as simpleas = + (13)Note that the actual bid price affected by all bid factors , . But in practice we found this approximation to be sufficientlyaccurate.We can also come up with more complicated models to capturethe interactive effect of bid factors from different dimensions onthe impression cost and volume. For example, we also tested thefollowing model for impression volume:",
  "=1 (14)": "Here, we assume the impression volume from group of dimension is determined by the product of two terms (plus intercept). Thefirst term is essentially its own bid factor . The second term isthe product of weighted sums of all other bid factors from other : Estimated impression volume based on the modeldescriped in Eq. (14) vs. observed impression volume for agiven day in an online test campaign. y-axis is the estimatedvolume and x-axis is the observed. Both values have beenscaled. dimensions. One can easily see that is monotonically increasingw.r.t any bid factor from other dimensions marginally.The models can be retrained frequently depending on the refreshfrequency of the impression log. If impression log refreshes daily,we can update the parameters , in Eq. (13) or , { },in Eq. (14) on a daily basis. compares the predicted next-day impression volume for each group of all dimensions based onthe model described in Eq. (14) and the real impression volumeobserved for one of our test campaigns.",
  "BID DIMENSION SELECTION": "The effectiveness of the optimization system depends heavily onthe validity of its assumptions. In .3, we demonstratedthe accuracy of the bid landscape approximation in real onlinecampaigns. But we also need to verify our assumptions on RPM,which states that the RPM for each group under a dimension isstable and independent from bid price. The behaviors of dimensionalRPM depends on how we define those dimensions. Ideally, thedimension and its groups should be chosen in such a way thatthe difference in RPM from different groups under a dimensionis maximized. In other words, the dimension of choice should beindicative of revenue and its groups should capture the relationshipbetween this dimension and revenue. For example, we can choosezip code as a dimension and group them into different buckets. Thepurchasing behavior of people from different geographical regionstend to differ; therefore, these zip buckets will have different ROASpotential for us to exploit. Hour of day is another feature of theimpression supply during prime hours is significantly higher thanother periods, which leads to cost and profitability differentiation.Other possible candidates for dimensions include OS type, devicetype, day of week, etc.",
  "Equal-volume with Ranked RPM": "No matter what criteria we use to define segments or groups undera dimension, we need to make sure there are enough impressionsfor us to observe stable revenue signals. Thus, one natural optionis group directly by impression volume. But randomly putting im-pressions into groups such that the groups have roughly the samevolume does not guarantee separations of the groups in terms ofRPM. Thus, we propose a two-step heuristic to define the groups.",
  "(1) First, we sort all unique dimensional features values (uniquezip codes, websites, hours, etc. observed in log so far) basedon their accumulative RPM": "(2) Second, we sequentially assign group labels to each value,from the one with the lowest RPM to the highest. We willmove to the next group label once the current one has enoughimpression volume based on historical data. Taking zip code as an example, in our implementation, we calcu-late the total impressions for each unique zip code and sort themby their accumulative RPM so far in ascending order. Then, weput the top zip code into group 1. Depending on the number ofgroups we set, we iteratively put the next zip code into a bucketso that at the end, all buckets have roughly the same number ofimpressions. Other than using RPM has the metric for sorting thevalues, we also experimented using conversion counts or ordercounts. Using conversion counts to sort previous the groups frombeing skewed by high-value purchasers when the total number ofimpression is low. In practice, we also suggest setting thresholds oneither volume or orders before estimating the RPM. The system canwait until there is enough sales signal to trigger the group creationand dimensional adjustments.More grouping methods can be developed based on the specificdimensions we choose. For example, zip codes are hierarchical anddefine a natural geological clustering; thus we can group them bythe first few digits. Website can also be grouped based on theircategories . Hours of day and week can be easily grouped intoprime and low-velocity periods. Yet, the question remains: howdo we decide which dimension to include in the bid adjustmentsand how many groups should each dimension have? To assess thequality of the dimensions we choose and the groups defined, wealso propose several evaluation criterion.",
  "Bid Dimension and Group Evaluation": "4.2.1Evaluation by RPM Distances. A straightforward way of de-termining the separation of different groups in terms of RPM iscomparing their daily accumulative RPM numbers. This daily accu-mulative defines a time series of RPMs and if the difference betweenthe two time series from two different groups is large, we can saythe groups are well-separated and vice versa. To quantitatively mea-sure the difference, we propose the following heuristic measure.Suppose we have groups under a dimension, we first computethe daily accumulative RPM for each group. Then, we use the abso-lute value of the sum of daily differences to represent the distancebetween two groups, as shown in Eq. (16). We also define a metric (,) as in Eq. (15) to measure the number of cross-overs betweenthe two time series; the fewer the cross-overs, the higher will be,and thus, the bigger the final distance will be.",
  "(16)": "In the end, we can use the median or average distances among allpairs of groups to quantify the quality of the set of groups defined. and 5 show the WOE values of different groups createdbased on dimension zip code and website. The large variance in theWOE values among the groups indicate a high predicative powerof the groups on RPM. 4.2.2Evaluation by Information Value Criteria. Another methodwe implemented is based on information theory. Intuitively, wewant the revenue distributions from different groups of a dimen-sion to be as different as possible so that different bid adjustmentscan be applied. From information theory we have a metric to mea-sure exactly this difference information value (IV). The higherIV a variable has, the more predictive power it has towards thetarget variable. IV is defined as the weighted sum of weight ofevidence (WOE). We used a slightly modified version of WOEto accommodate continuous features. %conversions is defined asthe percentage of converted impressions in group of a single di-mensions. %impressions is the percentage of impressions fromgroup out of all impressions. Given a dimension and its groups,we calculate the percentage of revenue, impressions falling intoeach group w.r.t. the total revenue and total impression volume,respectively. The modified WOE is defined as the log ratio betweenthe two.",
  "(18)": "4.2.3Mutual Information Value Criteria. The two criterion intro-duced above are mostly for evaluating groups of a single dimension.To evaluate multiple dimensions, we propose the following metricbased on the Mutual Information . Let {0, 1} be the conver-sion flag variable of an impression, be the group label variableof dimension , () be the empirical density function.",

While costs are equal,the test campaign achieved higher revenue, ROAS, transac-tion rate with lower eCPM. For confidentiality reason, allnumbers have been rescaled.",
  "ONLINE TEST RESULTS": "We ran a proof-of-concept test campaign together with a controlcampaign to evaluate the bid optimization framework. Both a testand a control campaign were set up using the same targeting cri-terion and launched simultaneously for the same flight durationof one month. The targeted audiences were split randomly intothe test and control groups. The campaign budgets for the test andcontrol are also the same. The overall system operates as describedin .Based on the data we collected during the first week of the cam-paigns, we defined our groups based on two dimensions: designated-marketing-area (DMA) and site. DMAs were split into 5 groupswhile the sites into 4. We used selection by volume method de-scribed in .1. Throughout the campaign period, we kepttrack of the accumulative RPM values for each group and plot themin .

  "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK": "In this work we proposed a bid optimization framework for offsiteads campaigns on 3P DSPs. The framework applies bid adjustmentsto the base bid price based on the different segments of the impres-sion universe. Instead of treating each segment as independent, weassign bid adjustment on marginal dimensions to avoid parame-ter explosion and the curse of dimensionality. By translating theproblem into a constraint non-convex optimization problem, wecan find locally optimal bid factors to maximize daily revenue.The performance of the initial version of the optimization frame-work was tested in production environment based on randomizedexperiments. We made bid adjustments every other day over theflight of the campaign and achieved higher ROAS than the con-trol group with statistical significance. The online experiment wasconduct in a strict A/B testing fashion.However, there are several issues yet to be resolved. For example,the current way of defining dimension and groups is very crude asit does not guarantee maximum and stable separations in terms ofrevenue per impression or conversion rate among the bid dimen-sions and groups. For the next step, we will explore other ways,such as combining prior knowledge of campaigns under the samecategory with historical data. In our initial experiment with themethod, we already were able to identify that zip code-based bidgroups are more indicative of revenue behavior than features suchas hour of day using information value. We believe later when wealso incorporate interactive effect metrics for measuring pairs ofdimensions, we will identify the bid dimensions and groups moreefficiently.",
