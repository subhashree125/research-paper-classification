  "In the present scenario, significant advancement of computer sys-": "tems completely changed our daily lives and made our existence dependant on them. From small companies to large enterprises, in-dividuals to government agencies, many of their activities are performed through network services . With the tremendous growth of the use of Internet, our computer systems are exposed to elevate high amount of threats. Any vulnerability in the network devices and computing plat-forms can expose the network system under various attacks and may lead to catastrophic consequences . While dealing with monitoring, prevention, detection, and reaction to cyber security events and prospective network attacks/intrusions, organisations should concentrate on cutting-edge technology to support human analysts . It is quite difficult to successfully identify and stop the invasions in their tracks. Traditional network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are rule- or signature-based systems that have not been sufficient for the rapidly expanding network and are unable to handle assaults because to their increasing volume, complexity, and deflation . The firewall is designed to prevent unauthorised access to the whole network or systems. It has been shown that the firewall and its versions are readily circumvented by attackers, for instance by utilising a bogus source address. Moreover, a great deal of assaults like DoS and DDoS went undetected. An innovative security mechanism known as the \"Intrusion Detection System\" has been developed to address the short-comings of current conventional security methods (IDS) . The process of analyzing a computer system or networks activity and examining it for indications of potential events, such as violations or suspicious behavior of computer security regulations, acceptable usage guidelines, or standard security procedures, is known as intrusion detection . There are too many possible causes of events, including dangerous malware (like worms and spyware), internet hackers who get remote access to networks, and privileged persons who misuse their",

  ". Intrusion detection methodologies": "A variety of methods are used by IDS technology to detect intrusions. Anomaly-based detection and intrusion detection based on signatures are the two primary categories of detection technologies. The majority of IDS systems use a range of detection methods, either alone or in combination, to accurately identify intrusions . 1.1.1. Signature-based detection Signature-based detection, also known as misuse-based detection, is used to keep the database of signatures from recognized attacks current. A risk may be recognized by its signature, which is a pattern. If there is a match between the data gathered from the audit unit and the database, alarms can go out. These patterns represent suspicious collections of potentially risky practices or behaviors that have been recorded in da-tabases. This systems primary benefit is how rapidly it can identify patterns and fingerprints and, after some acclimation, how well it can comprehend network dynamics. Attacks that have been effective in the past and whose patterns have been noted in the database should be kept up . 1.1.1.1. Anomaly-based detection. Anomaly-based IDS, also known as behavior-based IDS, is the second approach type. These systems learn the regular behavior of people, hosts, network connections, or applica-tions rather than preserving the signatures of known assaults. The development of the behavior profiles involves monitoring the traits of typical behavior over time. A few behavioral traits that may be used to create profiles include a users use of email, unsuccessful login attempts, and processor usage over a specific time frame . As an intrusion detection system creates the initial profiles for its detection algorithms, it may spot malicious behavior. Every difference from the norm is regarded with suspicion, and a warning is given. These systems work under the assumption that any unusual activity or behavior deviates greatly from the norm. These systems are adept at identifying zero-day attacks by design . 1.1.1.2. Hybrid based detection\\. Combining the signature and anomaly based techniques will increase the benefits and reduce the drawbacks of both approaches. By using this approach, it is possible to reduce the number of false alarms while increasing the rate of zero-day attack detection. No system, according to a study by A. Buczak, was solely based on signatures or anomalies; instead, IDSs are often installed as a combination of both signature and anomaly setup .",
  ". Problem statement": "The primary focus is anomaly-based intrusion detection systems, and it significantly advances the field of such IDS. The high incidence of false alerts that anomaly-based IDS experiences is widely recognized. The high false positive rate is still being worked on. We think the issue may be treated as a classification issue since data analysis is involved in intrusion detection. This discovery further demonstrates the effective-ness of categorization systems since cleaner input data increases the likelihood of accurate outcomes. From an anomaly-based approach, it suggests that the false positive rate may be significantly reduced if we are successful in extracting characteristics that effectively distinguish normal data from abnormal data. So, in this study, we examine the methods for differentiating between normal and aberrant data . Similar to the preceding observation, we see that the bulk of intru- sion detection methods based on data mining and machine learning use well-established tools and procedures. These recommended techniques may end up being unsuccessful in precisely identifying data as normal or abnormal. As it is required to modify such strategies to meet the re-quirements of intrusion detection, we utilize deep learning and concentrate on this area of our work.",
  ". Artificial intelligence": "Making robots behave like a human brain is the broad field of computer science known as artificial intelligence (AI). Using traditional computational approaches, it is utilised to elucidate complicated issues. The phrase \"artificial intelligence\" was first used in 1956 by computer scientists who wanted to know whether robots could \"think\" like people. Marvin Minksy described it as \"the science of having robots accomplish things that would need intelligence if they were done by humans\" . Chollets definition of artificial intelligence as \"the endeavour to auto-mate intellectual processes ordinarily done by humans\" is another comparable concept. In order to achieve the objective of automating intelligent tasks that are typically performed by people, artificial intel-ligence encompasses various methodologies in addition to the subfields of artificial learning and deep learning. These methods work well for tackling clearly stated logical problems, such as those involved in games, but they are not well suited for dealing with more challenging tasks, such picture categorization and language translation. As a result, ma-chine learning, a more recent approach to artificial intelligence, has surpassed other approaches to symbolic AI in popularity .",
  ". Machine learning": "The study and development of systems from data are topics covered by a branch of artificial intelligence known as \"machine learning\" . Machine Learning algorithms that adapt and gain knowledge from data are known as machine learning algorithms. Instead of actively instructing the computer and telling it what to do, machine learning approaches allow the software to indirectly learn what output to create depending on incoming data. This enables the computer to do tasks and make choices on a variety of data kinds that it has never seen before owing to learning from data.",
  ". Deep learning": "Deep Learning, a complex kind of machine learning, employs many levels of data abstraction at different processing stages . With the use of back-propagation, Deep Learning shows how a computer can learn the complex dataset structures while also adjusting internal set-tings at each layer. It succeeds in generalizing new instances when the data is complex and has a high degree of dimensionality. Deep learning also makes it possible to train nonlinear models on huge datasets. Although deep learning has lately become more well-known, it has been present since the 1940s. The first algorithms for deep learning mainly took inspiration from biologically inspired computer models of the human brain. While it is still recognized as a major source of inspiration for deep learning, the neuro-scientific method is no longer the core pillar of the field. There is just a lack of knowledge about the basic mechanisms and algorithms the brain employs to operate. This is a current and active area of research within the field of \"computational neuroscience\" .",
  ". Recurrent neural network (RNN)": "The RNN is a development over the conventional feed-forward neural network. The foundation of RNN is sequential data. Each input and each output in a traditional neural network, in our opinion, are distinctive. Since each element in a sequence is processed in the same manner, with the outcome depending on past computations, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are so named. To get contextual information, each unit in an RNN receives both the past and current states .",
  ". Long Short Term Memory recurrent neural network (LSTM RNN)": "As it develops over time, a deep neural network creates a FNN for each time-step. The gradient algorithm is then used to adjust the weights and biases for each hidden layer, minimizing the discrepancy between the expected and actual outputs. If the time steps are more than 5 to 10, the typical RNNs are unable to perform as intended. Long-term back propagation allows erroneous signals to erupt or disappear, resulting in variable weights that lower the networks efficacy. The problem of vanishing/exploding gradient in RNN is overcome using Gated Recur-rent Units and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks (GRUs). The LSTM employs a gating system to control long-term dependency . Every time a step is taken, the cell state of the LSTM is sent along. The information going through is optimised via a gating technique. Input gate (it), forget gate (ft), and output gate are the three gates present in each LSTM cell (Ot). The contribution of the current input and the prior output to the new cell state is determined by the forget and input gate (ct). How much of ct is revealed as the input is determined by the output gate.",
  ". Literature review": "The researchers have created many intrusion detection systems during the last ten years. They were created for host-based and network- based intrusion detection systems, respectively. The systems that are being offered are hybrid systems that combine HIDS/NIDS with signa-ture- and anomaly-based technologies. The intrusion detection system is a kind of computational intelligence intelligence system. Computational intelligences primary objective is to provide answers to challenging real-world issues. In order to build a more reliable IDS, a successful IDS must mix soft computing technologies with more complex mathematical procedures and traditional analytic methods. In this paper, we examine three crucial research areas with major implications for the suggested framework. Initially, both machine learning and deep learning methods for shallow learning intrusion detection are reviewed. We discuss cur-rent hybrid intrusion detection systems in the second part. Lastly, we provide some analyses and conclusions from the literature reviews . For intrusion detection, deep learning, a branch of machine learning that has lately gained prominence, has been applied. Most studies have proven that deep learning completely outperforms traditional methods. The literature overview of the single- and hybrid-deep learning meth-odologies that have been used by researchers is covered in this part . In order to tackle intrusion detection issues that are impacted by large dimensionality, high related characteristics, and high network data quantity, Levent Koc et al. created a Hidden nave Bayes data mining approach. To improve the performance of the developed approach on the KDD99 dataset, they applied two well-known variation methods in this experiment: entropy minimization discretization and proportional k-interval discretization. The model contains a feature se-lection model based on three filter approaches, including INTERACT feature selection methods, correlation-based consistency-based, and filtering based on correlation. These methods aid in the suggested methods successful completion of the KDD99 dataset. In terms of detection accuracy, error rate, and misclassification cost, the model exhibits generally improved results. The FCANN technique, developed by Gang Wang et al. and based on fuzzy clustering and artificial neural networks, is a revolu-tionary approach. To ensure homogeneity within the clusters and het-erogeneity across the clusters, the provided data is divided into clusters. Every training subsets size and complexity are decreased by the fuzzy clustering module, which also increases the efficacy and efficiency of the following ANN module. Implemented ANN as traditional feed-forward neural networks trained with the back propagation technique to antic-ipate incursion. The fuzzy aggregation module is used to combine several NN results and minimise detection mistakes. In terms of accuracy and detection stability, the experimental findings utilising the KDD99 dataset show efficacy, notably in low frequency attack detection, such as R2L and U2R assaults. The hybrid intrusion detection approach described by Gisung Kim et al. blends the misuse detection model and anomaly detection models data decomposition structure hierarchically. Regular training data are divided into manageable subsets using the C 4.5 decision al-gorithm. In each deconstructed area, an anomaly detection model was created using the one-class support vector machine (1-class SVM). For the NSL-KDD dataset, the suggested approach is assessed. In this method, the test samples are categorised in a dissected area using one of the SVM models with a single class. The decomposition method might reduce the amount of time spent testing for abnormalities. The hybrid model reduced the train and test times while enhancing IDS performance. A unique combined principal component analysis (PCA) and Support vector machine (SVM) was created by Sumaiya Thaseen et al. by enhancing the kernel parameters using an automated parameter selec-tion approach. By taking into account minority attacks like U2R and R2L, the KDD dataset is painstakingly split into train and test datasets. Early on, PCA chooses an appropriate subset of each characteristic while excluding those that are redundant or unneeded. To preserve a higher value that may be used to build the feature vectors, PCA often utilises a variance threshold. The necessary parameters are obtained from PCA in the second step as a train and test set for SVM to carry out a classifica-tion. In order to decrease train and test overhead time, the classifiers categorised the assaults using a smaller feature set. Based on the intersection concept of mathematics, Ketan Sanjay and colleagues suggested a feature selection strategy. Three distinct kinds of feature selection strategies are used in this method. application of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the correlation-based feature se-lection (CFS) technique. After CFS, intersection of various population sizes was obtained using the GA approach. With a pre-processed dataset, Information Gain (IG) and Correlation Attribute Evaluator (CAE), two additional filter techniques, are used with ranker as the search algo-rithm. J48 and Naive Bayes classifiers were used to categorize the testing characteristics. The accuracy, runtime, and chosen number aspects of the results are assessed using the NSL-KDD dataset. Principle component analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used to create Sumaiya Thaseen Ikram et alsuggested.s hybrid intrusion detection model To achieve the best feature subset with the greatest eigen values kept in each eigen vector, the PCA created eigen vectors for each feature. The class label is predicted using the SVM classifier. During the training step, the feature matrix is used to identify the class labels. To recognize the pattern of unknown traffic, the testing step uses the learning rules from the training phase. SVM classifier chooses automated parameters by optimizing kernel parameters. This technique reduces the train and test times while improving accuracy by optimizing the kernel parameter () and punishment factor (C). On the NSL-KDD dataset, the models evaluation yields results. Sasanka Potluri et al. developed the Accelerated Deep Neural Network (DNN) to find abnormalities in network data. Its architecture consists of pre-training and fine-tuning techniques. In the pre-training process, two autoencoders are used. Out of the 41 features in the NSL-KDD dataset, one autoencoder with 20 neurons selected 20 fea-tures, while a second autoencoder with 10 neurons selected 10 features.",
  ". Research Gap": "Lets talk about the numerous methods that various writers have used in their study efforts in this subject. The majority of studies employed classifiers and cluster algorithms as an intrusion detection system, according to the literature review stated above. Subsequently, coupled with classifiers, feature extraction techniques are employed to extract the crucial characteristics. Several researchers in this important field have used hybrid classifiers for intrusion detection, which include feature extraction, clustering, and classification techniques. Ensemble classifiers were employed as Intrusion Detection approaches by a very small number of researchers. The majority of the suggested methods were tested using the KDD CUP 1999 dataset, and more recently, the researchers utilised the NSL-KDD dataset, which is an updated version of",

  "In recent years, numerous researchers have developed hybrid clas-": "sifier algorithms using feature selection methods. Comparing these techniques to single classifiers, they achieved greater accuracy. Yet, there hasnt been much research done on ensemble classifiers. The methods for feature selection Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Correlation Feature Selection (CFS), and other methods were employed in machine learning to extract feature selection, and some researchers utilised autoencoders to do so. Higher performance was generated by the unsupervised autoencoders. The majority of the approaches made use of benchmark datasets like the NSL-KDD and KDD CUP 1999 datasets. Several academics have employed data mining and machine learning approaches to assess approximations of the actual performance of intrusion detection in real-time data. The vast majority of these methods were developed using shallow learning architectures. Some architectural designs still fall short in terms of intrusion detection. Several studies have categorised two classes as either an attack or as normal. Due to a lack of labelled training data and unpredictable network traffic, traditional machine learning algorithms are ineffective at detecting zero-day attacks and low frequency assaults like R2L and U2R. With a large number of datasets, deep learning algorithms are appropriate for feature learning and classification. We get the conclusion that using a feature reduction technique is crucial to lowering the computing expense and improving classifier performance from the research results and review of the literature. It is challenging to create a single classifier approach due to the benefits of feature selection and feature extraction in detecting assaults using classifiers. It is advised to employ a hybrid strategy that combines feature extraction with feature selection to improve intrusion detection accuracy. As Deep Learning algorithms are more adaptive to systems with greater processing speeds and Graphics Processor Units, it is thereby advised for an enhancement of intrusion detection in the area of cyber security (GPU).",

These models consisting of pre- processing, feature extraction, training and testing phases. The raw data attributes consist of umerical and non-numerical values. Deep learning algorithms only required numerical attributes as an input. The numer-icalization process performs conversion of non-numerical attributes in to numerical attributes. The numericalization process can be done with label encoder. Label encoding assigns unique feature values to the non- numerical features. Some numericalized data attributes consist of large feature values and some feature values consist of minimum value. The difference between minimum and maximum feature value is very large. This difference is affected the original feature values. The normalization process avoids the effectiveness of the original feature values. Normal-ization could be done with min-max normalization. The normalized data is given as an input to our proposed hybrid methodology. The deep learning models self-learned the features and classify the data as multi attack classification.

These significant differences in attri-butes might reduce performance effectiveness. Both of these feature settings are incompatible and inappropriate for use. A method called min-max normalization transforms the initial feature data using a linear transformation. The features minimum and maximum values are retrieved, and then each value is changed using the formula below.",
