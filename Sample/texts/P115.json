  "Abstract": "This document provides a summary of a presentation centered on extensive multi-modal models, specifically their development to a level comparable to and poten-tially exceeding that of multimodal GPT-4. The exploration is divided into threesections. Initially, the context is established by discussing recent large-scale modelsakin to GPT, which are designed for vision and language processing. This sets thestage for exploring research in large multimodal models (LMMs) that are fine-tunedwith instructions. Subsequently, the foundational aspects of instruction tuning inlarge language models are covered, which is a method that is further adapted tothe multimodal domain. The final section demonstrates the creation of a basicversion of multimodal models similar to GPT-4 using publicly available resources.Additionally, a review of newly developing areas in this field is presented.",
  "Introduction": "With the widespread integration of advanced language models into modern society, theres a burgeon-ing enthusiasm among scholars and scientists to create open-source large language models (LLMs)and to investigate their growth into large multimodal models (LMMs). This manuscript concentrateson leveraging LLMs for multimodal applications and training LMMs in a comprehensive manner,enabling them to process visual data and engage in conversation.",
  "Image-to-Text Generative Models": "In their present configuration, LMMs predominantly function as image-to-text generators, acceptingimages as input and producing textual content as output. The architectural design of these modelsgenerally includes an image encoder for deriving visual characteristics and a language model forgenerating textual sequences. These visual and linguistic components can be interconnected throughan adaptable module. Both the image encoder and the language model have the flexibility to bedeveloped from the ground up or based on previously trained models. The training methodology typically involves employing an auto-regressive loss on the generated texttokens. Within the Transformer framework, image tokens have the capability to interact with oneanother, and each text token is influenced by the preceding text tokens and all image tokens.",
  "**Case Study II: LMM Trained with Interleaved Image-Text Sequences**": "Flamingo serves as an exemplary model in this category, incorporating pre-trained image and languagemodels with the addition of new integrative components. It includes a Perceiver Sampler to streamlinecomputational demands and a Gated Transformer to enhance stability during the early training phase.Flamingo is trained on a diverse mix of large-scale multimodal data sourced exclusively from the web,bypassing the need for conventionally annotated machine learning datasets. Post-training, Flamingocan adapt to vision-based tasks through few-shot learning without additional task-specific tuning. A standout feature of Flamingo is its capability for multimodal in-context learning. When presentedwith image-text pairs as a demonstration, Flamingo can generalize to new, unseen tasks, suchas visual math problems, without further training. It successfully interprets the patterns in taskinstructions from examples and applies this understanding to new images. Flamingo representsa significant advancement in multimodal learning, akin to the breakthroughs seen with GPT-3 inlanguage processing.",
  "OpenAI Multimodal GPT-4 and Research Gaps": "Released in March 2023, OpenAIs GPT-4 showcases advanced capabilities in understanding andreasoning with visual data. Although specifics of the model remain undisclosed, its ability to facilitatenew applications is evident from highlighted examples in technical reports. For instance, it candiscern unusual elements within images and demonstrate sophisticated reasoning across text andimages. The inquiry into constructing models akin to Multimodal GPT-4 leads us to examine OpenAIsadvanced models, as depicted in . Key observations are: (i) GPT-2 serves as the auto-regressive equivalent in the era dominated by BERTs pre-training then fine-tuning paradigm. (ii)GPT-3, a 175-billion parameter model trained on extensive web text, showcases emergent propertiessuch as in-context learning and chain-of-thoughts (CoT) reasoning without requiring further training.This model represents a shift from fine-tuning model weights to utilizing prompts for broadergeneralization and reduced adaptation costs. (iii) ChatGPT and InstructGPT emphasize the importanceof models following instructions and aligning with human intentions by fine-tuning on high-qualityinstruction data and using a reinforcement learning framework. (iv) GPT-4 not only enhances previousmodels language capabilities but also incorporates visual inputs for comprehension and reasoning.",
  "**Traditional Language Data**": "In the realm of natural language processing, the seq2seq format is frequently employed, whereeach data point comprises an input sequence and a corresponding output sequence. Typically, taskinstructions are implicitly understood rather than explicitly stated. Models trained on this data formatoften struggle to adapt to new tasks in a zero-shot manner because they lack the ability to interpretand generalize task instructions during testing.",
  "Self-Instruct and Open-Source LLMs": "The collection of a wide array of high-quality instruction-following data can be achieved throughtwo primary methods: human-human interaction and human-machine interaction. The former isresource-intensive, involving human task providers and annotators, while the latter involves machinesor models performing the annotation tasks under human guidance. Self-Instruct tuning represents a streamlined and potent method for aligning LLMs with humanintent, utilizing instruction-following data produced by leading teacher LLMs. This technique,which leverages the in-context learning capability of LLMs, has significantly enhanced the zero- andfew-shot generalization abilities of LLMs. The iterative process, as illustrated in , involveshumans providing initial examples, which the LLM then uses to generate further instructions andresponses, refining the dataset iteratively.",
  "Data Creation": "Instead of directly inputting images into OpenAI GPT, symbolic sequence representations are used,as shown in (a). LLaVA utilizes captions and bounding boxes for several reasons: (1)GPT-4 is found to comprehend these representations effectively, unlike ChatGPT, which struggleswith bounding box data; (2) these elements are crucial for an informative representation of the image. As demonstrated in (b), three forms of instruction-following data are used: multi-turnconversations for interactive user engagement, detailed descriptions for comprehensive responsegeneration, and complex reasoning to address the implications beyond the image content.",
  "Network Architecture and Training": "As shown in , LLaVAs architecture is a specific implementation of the general image-to-textgenerative model framework discussed in and . LLaVA integrates a pre-trainedCLIP ViT-L/14 visual encoder with the Vicuna large language model via a projection matrix. Thetraining process involves two stages: - **Stage 1: Pre-training for Feature Alignment.** Only the projection matrix is updated usinga portion of the CC3M dataset, focusing solely on image captioning. - **Stage 2: End-to-EndFine-tuning.** Both the projection matrix and the LLM are fine-tuned to cater to various applicationscenarios.",

For instance, LLaVA and Mini-GPT4 are leading the way in thecreation of multimodal chatbots, replicating some of the functions described in OpenAIs GPT-4technical documentation. Additionally, GILL has broadened the capabilities of LMMs to includecomprehensive image generation, a feature not currently present in GPT-4. From the standpoint ofintroducing basic versions of new multimodal features, the open-source community is seemingly onpar with OpenAIs Multimodal GPT-4, taking initial steps toward developing a versatile multimodalassistant. Nevertheless, there remains a significant disparity when it comes to enhancing a particular func-tionality, such as the visual reasoning seen in LLaVA. The technical documentation from OpenAIprovides examples of complex visual tasks that necessitate models capable of processing numeroushigh-resolution images and extended sequences, in addition to delivering responses that require spe-cialized knowledge. This demands significantly greater computational power and more sophisticatedlanguage models, which are generally not accessible to most individuals.",
