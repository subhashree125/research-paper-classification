  "Introduction": "This research delves into the mechanisms underlying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a techniquethat significantly boosts the performance of large language models (LLMs) on intricate reasoning tasks.CoT achieves this enhancement by strategically decomposing complex problems into a sequenceof simpler, more manageable sub-problems. Our investigation centers on understanding how thisdecomposition process impacts the models learning and reasoning capabilities, particularly withinthe context of in-context learning (ICL). We focus on compositional functions, using multi-layerperceptrons (MLPs) as a representative model architecture, to analyze the effects of CoT on variousaspects of model performance. A key aspect of our study is the examination of CoTs influence on sample complexity. We hypothesizethat by breaking down complex tasks, CoT reduces the number of training examples required toachieve a given level of accuracy. This reduction in sample complexity is crucial for efficient trainingand deployment of LLMs, especially when dealing with limited datasets or computationally expensivetraining processes. Furthermore, we explore how CoT affects the approximation power of the model,investigating whether the decomposition process allows the model to learn and represent morecomplex functions effectively. Our analysis considers the interplay between the complexity of thetarget function, the number of training examples, and the length of the CoT prompts. The impact of CoT on the pretraining phase of LLM development is another critical area of ourresearch. We investigate whether the structured reasoning facilitated by CoT leads to more efficientlearning during pretraining, resulting in models with improved generalization capabilities. We positthat the decomposition inherent in CoT allows the model to learn more robust and transferablerepresentations, which are less susceptible to overfitting and perform better on unseen data.

  "Related Work": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoningcapabilities of large language models (LLMs) . Our work builds upon this line of research,focusing specifically on the impact of CoT on in-context learning (ICL) of compositional functions,particularly within the context of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Previous studies have demonstratedthe effectiveness of CoT in various tasks, such as question answering and commonsense reasoning , but a comprehensive analysis of its influence on sample complexity and approximation powerwithin the framework of ICL remains relatively unexplored. This research aims to fill this gapby providing a detailed investigation of CoTs mechanisms and its implications for efficient LLMtraining and deployment. We leverage both theoretical and empirical approaches to gain a deeperunderstanding of how CoT facilitates the learning of complex functions. The reduction of sample complexity is a crucial aspect of our investigation. While prior work hastouched upon the potential of CoT to reduce the number of training examples needed , a systematicanalysis of this effect across different function complexities and prompt lengths is lacking. Ourstudy addresses this by conducting extensive experiments to quantify the impact of CoT on samplecomplexity, providing quantitative evidence of its efficiency gains. Furthermore, we explore therelationship between CoT prompt length and model performance, investigating the optimal balancebetween detailed intermediate steps and computational efficiency. This analysis contributes to thedevelopment of more effective and efficient CoT prompting strategies. Our research also delves into the theoretical underpinnings of CoTs success. Existing explanationsoften focus on heuristic interpretations of CoTs behavior , but a rigorous theoretical framework isneeded to fully understand its impact on generalization and approximation power. We address this bydeveloping a theoretical model that explains how CoT guides the model towards a more structuredand interpretable solution space, leading to improved generalization capabilities.

We explore how thestructured reasoning induced by CoT guides the model towards a more efficient and interpretablesolution space, leading to improved generalization. The theoretical framework is designed to providea principled explanation for the observed empirical results. Our empirical investigation involves a series of experiments designed to validate our theoreticalhypotheses and quantify the effects of CoT. We use a range of MLP architectures and reasoning tasksof varying complexity, systematically varying the number of training examples and the length of theCoT prompts. For each experiment, we measure the models accuracy and compare the performanceof CoT prompting against standard ICL. The experiments are designed to assess the impact of CoTon sample complexity, measuring the reduction in the number of training examples required toachieve a given level of accuracy. We also analyze the relationship between CoT prompt length andmodel performance, identifying the optimal prompt length for different tasks and model architectures.The data collected from these experiments is used to validate our theoretical model and providequantitative evidence of CoTs effectiveness. The datasets used in our experiments consist of synthetically generated data designed to representcompositional functions of varying complexity. This allows us to control the complexity of the tasksand isolate the effects of CoT from other factors that might influence performance in more complexreal-world datasets. The synthetic data is generated using a set of predefined rules, ensuring that thefunctions are well-defined and their complexity can be precisely controlled. This approach allows fora more rigorous and controlled evaluation of CoTs impact on sample complexity and approximationpower. We also explore the use of different prompting strategies, varying the level of guidanceprovided in the CoT prompts and the types of intermediate steps included. The evaluation metrics used in our experiments include accuracy, sample complexity (measuredas the number of training examples required to achieve a given accuracy level), and generalizationperformance (measured on a held-out test set). We use statistical tests, such as t-tests, to comparethe performance of CoT prompting against standard ICL. The results are presented in tables andfigures, showing the impact of CoT on each of the evaluation metrics across different experimentalconditions. The analysis of these results focuses on identifying the key factors that contribute to CoTseffectiveness and understanding the limitations of the approach. We also investigate the relationshipbetween the theoretical predictions of our model and the empirical results, assessing the validity androbustness of our theoretical framework.

The results consistently demonstrated that CoT significantly reduced the sample complexitycompared to standard ICL. shows the relationship between the number of training examplesand accuracy for both CoT and ICL across different function complexities. As expected, CoTconsistently outperformed ICL, requiring significantly fewer examples to achieve the same level ofaccuracy, particularly for more complex functions. This reduction in sample complexity highlightsCoTs efficiency in learning from limited data. Further analysis revealed a non-linear relationshipbetween CoT prompt length and sample complexity reduction, suggesting an optimal prompt lengthexists for each task and model complexity.
