  "Introduction": "A significant hurdle in the field is the development of neural networks that are resistant to adversarialexamples. This paper shows that defenses created to address this issue are inadequate when facedwith a white box scenario. Adversarial examples are generated that diminish classifier accuracy tozero percent on a well known dataset, while adhering to a minimal perturbation constraint of 4/255, amore stringent limit than what was taken into account in the initial studies. The proposed attackseffectively generate targeted adversarial examples, achieving a success rate exceeding 97",
  "Background": "This paper assumes prior knowledge of neural networks and the methods for creating potent attacksagainst adversarial examples, alongside calculating such examples for neural networks possessingnon-differentiable layers. A concise review of essential details and notation will be provided. Adversarial examples are defined as inputs that closely resemble a given input with regard to a certaindistance metric (00a3, in this instance), yet their classification differs from that of the original input.Targeted adversarial examples are instances engineered to be classified as a predetermined targetlabel.",
  "Two defenses are scrutinized: Pixel Deflection and High-level Representation Guided Denoiser. Theauthors of these defenses are thanked for making their source code and pre-trained models accessible": "Pixel Deflection introduces a non-differentiable preprocessing step for inputs. A subset of pixels,determined by an adjustable parameter, is substituted with adjacent pixels. The resultant image oftenexhibits noise. To mitigate this, a denoising procedure is employed. High-level Representation Guided Denoiser (HGR) employs a trained neural network to denoiseinputs prior to their classification by a standard classifier. This denoiser is a differentiable, non-randomized neural network."
