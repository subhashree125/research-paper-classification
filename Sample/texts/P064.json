  "Related Work": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) with external tools has emerged as a significantarea of research . Early work focused primarily on integrating LLMs with specific tools,often requiring significant engineering effort for each new tool . These approaches lacked thegenerality and adaptability needed for seamless integration with a diverse range of tools. Our workbuilds upon these efforts by proposing a self-instruction framework that enables LLMs to learn toutilize tools in a more generalizable manner. This contrasts with previous methods that often reliedon extensive fine-tuning or complex architectures, limiting their scalability and applicability. Ourapproach emphasizes simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of open-sourceLLMs and tools. The modular design of our framework allows for easy integration of new tools andtasks, fostering a continuous improvement cycle driven by iterative instruction generation, modeltraining, and performance evaluation. Several recent studies have explored the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for tool use in LLMs . These methods typically involve training an RL agent to select and utilize tools based on a rewardsignal. However, these approaches often require significant amounts of labeled data or carefullydesigned reward functions, which can be challenging to obtain. Our self-instruction frameworkaddresses these limitations by leveraging a combination of prompt engineering and RL, allowing themodel to learn from a diverse set of instructions and tool usage examples without requiring extensivelabeled data. The iterative nature of our framework allows for continuous improvement, leadingto more robust and adaptable tool usage strategies. Furthermore, our focus on open-source LLMsdistinguishes our work from previous studies that primarily focused on proprietary models. The use of self-instruction for improving LLM capabilities has gained increasing attention . These methods typically involve generating a large dataset of instructions and correspondingresponses, which are then used to fine-tune the LLM. Our work extends this approach by incorporatingtool usage into the self-instruction framework. This allows the model to learn not only to generateappropriate responses but also to select and utilize the appropriate tools for a given task. Theintegration of tool usage into the self-instruction process is a key innovation that distinguishes ourwork from previous studies. This allows for a more holistic approach to LLM training, leading tomore robust and versatile models.",
