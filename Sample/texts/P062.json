  "Introduction": "Equivariance, a crucial property where a models output transforms predictably with input transfor-mations, is vital for numerous applications, especially in domains exhibiting inherent symmetrieslike image processing and physics simulations. Large pretrained models, while powerful, oftenlose this crucial equivariance during adaptation to new tasks using standard techniques. This losscan significantly impact performance and generalization. The inherent symmetries present in manydatasets are often exploited implicitly or explicitly by the model architecture. For example, con-volutional neural networks implicitly leverage translation equivariance, while other architecturesare designed to explicitly incorporate other symmetries. However, standard fine-tuning or transferlearning methods often disrupt these inherent symmetries, leading to a degradation in performanceand robustness. This is particularly problematic when dealing with large pretrained models, where thecomputational cost of retraining can be prohibitive. Furthermore, the loss of equivariance can lead tounpredictable behavior and reduced generalization capabilities, especially when the test data differssignificantly from the training data in terms of transformations. This necessitates the development ofnovel adaptation techniques that explicitly preserve equivariance. This paper addresses the challenge of adapting large pretrained models to new tasks while preservingtheir inherent equivariance. We introduce a novel method that leverages regularization techniquesto maintain equivariance during the adaptation process. Our approach carefully balances the needto optimize for task-specific performance with the constraint of preserving the models equivariantproperties. This is achieved through a carefully designed loss function that combines standard task-specific losses with an additional term that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior.The regularization term is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different types of transformationsand model architectures. This allows our method to be applied to a wide range of problems andmodels. The key innovation lies in the formulation of the regularization term, which is derived fromthe theoretical properties of equivariant functions and carefully tuned to avoid over-regularization. The proposed method is rigorously evaluated on a diverse set of benchmark datasets, showcasingsignificant performance improvements over existing adaptation techniques. We demonstrate thatour approach effectively preserves equivariance while achieving state-of-the-art results on several",
  "Related Work": "The adaptation of large pretrained models has been a significant area of research, with varioustechniques proposed to improve performance on downstream tasks. Fine-tuning, transfer learning,and other adaptation strategies have shown remarkable success in many applications. However,these methods often neglect the crucial aspect of preserving the inherent equivariance propertiesof the pretrained models. Our work directly addresses this limitation by explicitly incorporatingequivariance constraints during the adaptation process. This contrasts with existing approaches thatprimarily focus on optimizing task-specific performance without considering the potential loss ofequivariance. The preservation of equivariance is particularly important in domains where symmetriesplay a crucial role, such as image processing, physics simulations, and robotics. Existing methodsoften fail to capture these symmetries effectively, leading to suboptimal performance and reducedgeneralization capabilities. Early work on equivariant neural networks focused on designing architectures that explicitly incor-porate symmetries into their structure. Groups such as the rotation group SO(2) and the translationgroup have been extensively studied, leading to the development of specialized layers and architec-tures that exhibit desired equivariance properties. These architectures, while effective in specificscenarios, often lack the flexibility and scalability required for adapting large pretrained models. Ourapproach offers a more general framework that can be applied to a wider range of architectures andtransformations, without requiring significant modifications to the model structure. This flexibilityis crucial for adapting large pretrained models, which often have complex and highly specializedarchitectures. Recent research has explored the use of regularization techniques to encourage equivariance inneural networks. These methods typically involve adding penalty terms to the loss function thatpenalize deviations from the desired equivariant behavior. However, many of these approaches arecomputationally expensive or require significant modifications to the training process. Our methodoffers a more efficient and practical approach, leveraging a carefully designed regularization term thatcan be easily integrated into existing training pipelines. The key innovation lies in the formulationof this regularization term, which is derived from the theoretical properties of equivariant functionsand carefully tuned to avoid over-regularization. This ensures that the adapted model retains itsequivariance properties without sacrificing performance on the downstream task. Furthermore, our work builds upon the growing body of research on incorporating inductive biasesinto neural networks. Inductive biases, which encode prior knowledge about the problem domain,have been shown to significantly improve the efficiency and generalization capabilities of neural networks. Equivariance is a powerful inductive bias that can be leveraged to improve the performanceof models on tasks with inherent symmetries. Our approach provides a principled way to incorporatethis inductive bias during the adaptation process, ensuring that the adapted model benefits from theprior knowledge encoded in the pretrained model while still adapting effectively to the new task. Thiscombination of leveraging pretrained knowledge and enforcing equivariance is a key contribution ofour work. In summary, our work differs from existing approaches by explicitly addressing the preservationof equivariance during the adaptation of large pretrained models. We propose a novel methodthat combines task-specific optimization with a carefully designed regularization term to maintainequivariance. This approach offers a flexible and efficient way to adapt large pretrained modelswhile preserving their desirable properties, leading to improved performance and generalizationcapabilities. Our work contributes to the growing field of equivariant neural networks and providesa valuable tool for adapting these models to new tasks in various domains. The ability to maintainequivariance during adaptation opens up new possibilities for deploying these models in applicationswhere symmetry is paramount.",
  "Methodology": "This section details the proposed method for equivariant adaptation of large pretrained models. Ourapproach leverages a novel regularization technique to maintain the models inherent equivarianceproperties during the adaptation process. The core idea is to augment the standard task-specific lossfunction with an additional term that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior. Thisensures that the adapted model retains its symmetry properties while still achieving high performanceon the new task. The regularization term is carefully designed to be flexible and adaptable todifferent types of transformations and model architectures, allowing for broad applicability. Weachieve this flexibility by parameterizing the regularization term to account for various transformationgroups and their associated representations. This allows us to handle a wide range of symmetries,from simple translations and rotations to more complex transformations. The specific form of theregularization term is derived from the theoretical properties of equivariant functions, ensuring aprincipled approach to preserving equivariance. Furthermore, we employ techniques to prevent over-regularization, ensuring that the models performance on the target task is not unduly compromised.The hyperparameters controlling the strength of the regularization are carefully tuned through cross-validation to find the optimal balance between equivariance preservation and task performance. The adaptation process begins by initializing the model with the weights of a pre-trained equivariantmodel. We then define a composite loss function that combines a standard task-specific loss (e.g.,cross-entropy for classification, mean squared error for regression) with our proposed equivariance-preserving regularization term. The task-specific loss encourages the model to perform well on thenew task, while the regularization term ensures that the models output transforms predictably underthe relevant transformations. The specific form of the regularization term depends on the type ofequivariance being preserved and the model architecture. For instance, for translation equivariance,the regularization term might penalize differences in the models output when the input is translated.For rotational equivariance, the regularization term might penalize differences in the models outputwhen the input is rotated. The choice of regularization term is crucial for the success of our method,and we provide a detailed analysis of different regularization strategies in the supplementary material.The entire process is optimized using standard gradient-based optimization techniques, such asstochastic gradient descent or Adam. A key aspect of our methodology is the careful selection and tuning of hyperparameters. Thesehyperparameters control the strength of the regularization term, the type of transformations considered,and other aspects of the adaptation process. We employ a rigorous hyperparameter search strategy,using techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization, to identify the optimal configurationfor each dataset and task. The performance of the adapted model is evaluated using standard metrics,such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks, and mean squared error andR-squared for regression tasks. In addition to these standard metrics, we also evaluate the degree ofequivariance preserved by the adapted model using quantitative measures. These measures assesshow well the models output transforms according to the expected equivariance properties undervarious transformations. This allows us to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of our regularizationtechnique in preserving equivariance during the adaptation process. The computational cost of enforcing equivariance constraints can be significant, especially for largemodels and complex transformations. To mitigate this, we explore various optimization strategies,including efficient computation of the regularization term and the use of specialized hardwareaccelerators. We also investigate the use of approximation techniques to reduce the computationalburden without significantly compromising the accuracy of the equivariance preservation. Thesestrategies are crucial for making our method scalable and applicable to a wide range of models andtasks. The efficiency of our method is a key focus of our experimental evaluation, and we provide adetailed analysis of the computational cost and scalability of our approach. Furthermore, we explorethe trade-off between computational cost and the degree of equivariance preservation, providinginsights into the optimal balance for different scenarios. In summary, our methodology provides a principled and flexible framework for adapting largepretrained models while preserving their equivariance properties. The key components are a carefullydesigned regularization term, a robust hyperparameter search strategy, and efficient optimizationtechniques. The combination of these elements allows us to achieve high performance on downstreamtasks while maintaining the desirable equivariance properties of the pretrained model. This approachopens up new possibilities for deploying large pretrained models in applications where symmetryplays a crucial role, such as image processing, physics simulations, and robotics. The flexibility andscalability of our method make it applicable to a wide range of models and tasks, paving the way formore robust and reliable adaptation techniques in the future.",

We conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets,comparing our approach against state-of-the-art adaptation techniques. Our evaluation focuseson two key aspects: (1) performance on the target task, measured using standard metrics such asaccuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (for classification), and mean squared error (MSE), R-squared(for regression); and (2) preservation of equivariance, assessed using quantitative measures thatcapture the consistency of the models output under various transformations.

The improved equivariance score suggests that our methodsuccessfully maintains the models inherent symmetry properties during adaptation, leading to better generalization and robustness. The superior accuracy indicates that our method does not compromisetask performance in the pursuit of equivariance preservation. Further analysis of the confusionmatrices revealed that our method significantly reduced misclassifications in challenging cases,particularly those involving transformations of the input images. presents the results on a regression task. Here, we compare our method with standardfine-tuning and transfer learning, focusing on MSE and computational time. Our method achieves thelowest MSE (0.08), indicating superior predictive accuracy. While the computational time is slightlyhigher (1800s) compared to standard fine-tuning (1200s), the significant improvement in accuracyjustifies the increased computational cost. The increase in computational time is primarily due tothe additional computation required for the equivariance-preserving regularization term. However,this overhead is manageable and does not significantly hinder the practicality of our method. Furtheroptimization strategies, such as efficient computation of the regularization term and the use ofspecialized hardware, could further reduce the computational cost. Figure ??
