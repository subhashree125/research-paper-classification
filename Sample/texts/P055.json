  "Abstract": "By mandating a broader impact statement with every submission for this yearsconference, the program chairs at the conference highlighted ethics as a crucialcomponent of AI research. Building on precedents from other fields and a grow-ing awareness within the community, this paper seeks to explore how individualresearchers responded to this new requirement. This exploration includes theiropinions, their experiences during the drafting process, and their reflections aftertheir papers were accepted. We present survey results and key considerations toinform the next iteration of the broader impact requirement, should it continue tobe mandated for future conferences.",
  "Introduction": "There is a growing number of unethical uses of technology. To counter this trend, some proposalssuggest limiting investment or procurement without impact assessment, or even calling for outrightbans. Other proposals aim to instill ethical practices earlier in the research stage, before technologytransfers into products. Conferences that are typically technical have begun to host workshops onsocial impact issues and, in some instances, have announced more interdisciplinary subject areas. The most significant change may be the requirement for a statement of broader impact for allsubmissions. Unlike workshops and interdisciplinary tracks, which might be viewed as more specific,this requirement affects every submission, of which there are over 9000 this year. While broaderimpact statements themselves are not new to the wider research community, they are new to thisspecific community. This paper seeks to explore how individual researchers responded to the newrequirement, including their perspectives, their experiences and process in drafting the statements,and their subsequent thoughts after paper acceptances. This research was initiated through internal discussion at our organization, which then became partof a broader public conversation. To collect perspectives from researchers, both within and beyondour organization, we developed an online public survey. The findings from this survey help toinform considerations for designing the next iteration of the broader impact requirement, shouldit remain a requirement for future conferences. While it is recognized that researchers are not theonly intended audience for these statements, and that others also have responsibilities in ethicalresearch and technology development, researchers represent a critical mass to mobilize in this effort.Understanding the researchers experience and process is essential not only to the design of therequirement, but also to advancing ethical research practices in general.",
  "Survey Method": "The study employed an exploratory mixed-methods survey with both open and closed-ended questions.The survey was split into two sections, one for researchers who submitted to the conference, andanother for those who did not. The survey was anonymous, and no demographic information wascollected. The survey was distributed online via research community channels and on social media.The goals were to understand how researchers considered the implications of their research, how",
  "Survey Results": "A total of 50 participants responded to the survey, with the majority identifying as academics (72percent) and industry researchers (23.5 percent). There was a balanced breakdown by career stage,with graduate students making up the largest group of respondents (33 percent). Among the groupthat submitted, the majority identified their subject areas as deep learning and theory. However,among researchers who did not submit, deep learning and social aspects of machine learning were theprimary subject areas. The survey population was not compared to the overall population, though thiscould be an area for future study. Our questions focused on the process and challenges in completingthe submission requirement, the perceived impact of the requirement on paper acceptances, andresearchers views on the requirement.",
  "Process and Challenges": "When asked about their approach to the broader impact statements, 83.8 percent of respondentsindicated that they completed this part with their co-authors, without external help. The rest ofthe participants used other approaches such as accepting support or reaching out for help. A largemajority spent less than 2 hours on the statement, and almost half mentioned it was not challenging toprepare. There were differing trends for what could make it difficult. Some viewed their theoreticalwork as too distant from practical applications, making the exercise speculative. Others perceivedthe requirement as a \"bureaucratic constraint\". Researchers at different stages of their career foundthe exercise more or less challenging, but their professional domain did not appear to affect theirexperienced difficulty with the exercise.",
  "Impact on Submission": "Although it was clarified that submissions would not be rejected solely on the basis of the broaderimpact statement, the survey explored the researchers perspectives on this. For researchers whosubmitted, over 75 percent believed the statements were not taken into consideration, yet almost90 percent thought it was unclear how reviewers would evaluate the statements. Even with anunclear evaluation process, when asked how confident they were that their statement was adequatelyaddressing the requirement, 43.2 percent stated that they were either confident or very confident.Time spent did not seem to have an impact, since most of the respondents who spent less than anhour also received acceptances. Those who sought external help appeared to have a lower ratio ofrejections, but our sample size may be too small to draw conclusive results.",
  "Framing": "The survey explored researchers views on the requirement and its framing. Our results indicatedthat the community was divided on how to frame the requirement; 56 percent did not agree thatbroader impact was the right way to frame the requirement, while 44 percent did. This split wassimilar when compared to subject area, submitters vs. non-submitters, and academia vs. industry.Postdoctoral/early-career and mid-career respondents were more supportive of the requirementframing than students and senior researchers. There seems to be a general feeling that assessingbroader impact is important, but uncertainty regarding who should do it and how. Some respondentsdescribed the requirement as \"too broad\" or said they did not feel \"qualified to address the broaderimpact of their work.\" Some who supported the requirement found the thought process to be valuableand that it \"forces researchers to reflect on the impact of their research\".",
  "The survey results inform future iterations of the broader impact requirement. When asked whatcould have helped them most, 92 percent of respondents indicated that examples of statements": "would be most helpful. There will be an increasing number of examples to draw from in futureyears. Guidelines were the second most popular request, regarding when a statement might beapplicable or how to formulate one. This section proposes how to integrate respondent feedbackinto future iterations: rethinking the requirement design and framing, developing greater capacityand confidence among researchers, and reflecting the shared responsibility of ethical research andtechnology development.",
  "Requirement Design": "If the goal is to develop ethical research practices, there may be other approaches to achieve thisgoal. While written statements make sense given the paper-based nature of submissions, surveyrespondents indicated a mix of nonchalance, outright farce, or perceived burden. These attitudesmay have a counterproductive effect on an ethical research goal. We encourage program chairs toconsider mechanisms to limit that effect (e.g., an incentive for \"best\" broader impact statements).Such mechanisms are important not only to manage negative effects but also to encourage researcherswho found the exercise valuable.",
  "Capacity Building": "Given that many respondents felt they were not qualified to address the broader impact of theirwork, workshops may help build capacity over time, and provide a space for researchers to examinetheir work with a more diverse group of researchers. Discussions could help develop capacity andconfidence, and surface overlooked impacts. Interdisciplinary collaborations could also introducenew guidelines or methodologies such as the theory of change or consequence scanning.",
  "Shared Responsibility": "Recognizing how different systems and social contexts interact would increase the quality of thediscussion on broader impact, and develop a sense of shared responsibility for ethical research andtechnology development. Researchers are a critical mass, but others such as conference organizers,institutions, funders, and users also have roles and responsibilities. To address concerns aroundburden and expertise, the assessment of broader impact could be more of a multi-stakeholder exercise.",
  "Conclusion": "This paper and its underlying survey investigated how researchers approached the broader impactstatement and surfaced considerations to better design this requirement in future years. While thesurvey represented a small sample of the community, its results demonstrate a division regardinghow the requirement is framed. Initiating a conversation about broader impact is itself a step towardsestablishing norms and best practices for ethical research. We encourage further work to monitor theevolution of researchers perspectives, not only at top conferences, but also at-large."
