  "Introduction": "The objective of this research is to address the phenomenon of plasticity loss in deep reinforcementlearning (RL) agents, where neural networks lose their ability to learn effectively over time .This persistent challenge significantly hinders the long-term performance and adaptability of RLagents in dynamic environments. Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications orhyperparameter tuning, which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability . Ourwork introduces a novel intervention, termed \"plasticity injection,\" designed to directly tackle theroot causes of plasticity loss. This approach offers a more efficient and adaptable solution comparedto existing methods. The core idea behind plasticity injection is to dynamically adjust the learningcapacity of the neural network based on its current learning progress and the complexity of theenvironment. This adaptive approach contrasts with traditional methods that either maintain a fixednetwork architecture or employ computationally intensive retraining procedures. We hypothesizethat by carefully monitoring the agents learning trajectory and selectively injecting plasticity whereneeded, we can significantly improve the long-term performance and robustness of RL agents. Thistargeted approach minimizes unnecessary computational overhead and avoids the potential negativeconsequences of over-parameterization. Furthermore, our framework provides valuable insights intothe underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss, contributing to a deeper understanding of this criticalissue in RL. Plasticity injection operates on three key principles. First, it provides a diagnostic framework foridentifying the onset and severity of plasticity loss within an RL agent. This diagnostic capabilityallows for proactive intervention before performance degradation becomes significant. This diagnosticframework leverages a novel metric that quantifies the agents ability to adapt to changes in theenvironment. By continuously monitoring this metric, we can detect early signs of plasticity loss andtrigger the plasticity injection mechanism. The metric is designed to be computationally efficient androbust to noise, ensuring that the diagnostic process does not significantly impact the overall trainingtime. The specific details of this metric are discussed in . Second, plasticity injection mitigates plasticity loss without requiring an increase in the number oftrainable parameters or alterations to the networks prediction capabilities. This ensures that thecomputational overhead remains minimal while maintaining the integrity of the learned policy. This isachieved by selectively modifying the learning rates of specific neurons or layers within the network,",
  "Related Work": "The problem of plasticity loss in deep reinforcement learning has received increasing attentionin recent years. Several approaches have been proposed to address this challenge, but they oftensuffer from limitations in terms of computational efficiency or generalizability. Early work focusedprimarily on architectural modifications, such as incorporating mechanisms for continual learning. These methods often involve significant changes to the network architecture, leading toincreased computational complexity and potential instability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of thesearchitectural modifications can be highly task-specific, limiting their generalizability to different RLenvironments. Another line of research has explored the use of regularization techniques to improve the stabilityand plasticity of RL agents . These methods typically involve adding penalty terms to theloss function, encouraging the network to maintain a certain level of plasticity. However, thechoice of regularization parameters can be crucial and often requires careful tuning, which canbe computationally expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, the effectiveness of regularizationtechniques can vary significantly depending on the specific RL algorithm and environment. More recently, there has been a growing interest in meta-learning approaches for improving theadaptability of RL agents . These methods aim to learn a general-purpose learning algorithmthat can quickly adapt to new tasks or environments. While meta-learning techniques have shownpromising results in certain scenarios, they often require significant computational resources fortraining the meta-learner. Furthermore, the performance of meta-learning methods can be sensitive tothe choice of meta-learning algorithm and the design of the meta-training process. Our proposed plasticity injection framework differs from these existing approaches in several keyaspects. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for identifying the onset and severity of plasticityloss, allowing for proactive intervention. Second, it mitigates plasticity loss without requiringsignificant architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning. Third, it dynamically expandsnetwork capacity only when necessary, leading to improved computational efficiency. These featuresmake plasticity injection a more efficient and adaptable solution compared to existing methods foraddressing plasticity loss in RL. The unique combination of diagnostic capabilities, targeted plasticityadjustments, and adaptive capacity allocation distinguishes our approach from previous work.",
  "Methodology": "Our proposed approach, termed \"plasticity injection,\" addresses plasticity loss in deep reinforcementlearning agents through a three-pronged strategy: diagnosis, mitigation, and adaptive capacityexpansion. The core of our methodology lies in a novel diagnostic metric that continuously monitorsthe agents learning trajectory and adaptability. This metric, detailed in , quantifies theagents ability to respond to environmental changes, providing a sensitive indicator of plasticity lossonset and severity. Early detection is crucial, allowing for proactive intervention before significantperformance degradation occurs. The computational efficiency of this metric is paramount, ensuringminimal disruption to the overall training process. We employ a sliding window approach to smoothout short-term fluctuations in the metric, enhancing its robustness to noise and providing a morereliable signal for intervention. The threshold for triggering plasticity injection is dynamicallyadjusted based on the agents performance history, adapting to the inherent variability of differentRL environments. This adaptive thresholding prevents premature or unnecessary interventions,optimizing the efficiency of our approach. The diagnostic framework forms the foundation uponwhich the subsequent mitigation and capacity expansion strategies are built. The mitigation strategy focuses on targeted adjustments to the networks learning dynamics, ratherthan wholesale architectural changes. Instead of adding new parameters, we selectively modifythe learning rates of specific neurons or layers identified by the diagnostic framework as beingmost affected by plasticity loss. This targeted approach minimizes computational overhead whilepreserving the integrity of the learned policy. We employ a gradient-based optimization technique todetermine the optimal learning rate adjustments for each identified neuron or layer. This optimizationprocess considers both the current learning progress and the agents overall performance, ensuringthat the adjustments are both effective and stable. The learning rate adjustments are implementedusing a dynamic scaling factor, which is continuously updated based on the diagnostic metric. Thisdynamic scaling ensures that the plasticity injection mechanism adapts to the evolving needs of theagent throughout the training process. The specific algorithm for determining the optimal learningrate adjustments is detailed in Appendix A. Adaptive capacity expansion is triggered only when the diagnostic metric indicates a significantand persistent decline in the agents adaptability, despite the mitigation efforts. This ensures thatcomputational resources are not wasted on unnecessary capacity increases during periods of stableperformance. The capacity expansion is implemented by adding new neurons or layers to the network,strategically placed based on the information provided by the diagnostic framework. The addition ofnew neurons or layers is guided by a principled approach that minimizes disruption to the existingnetwork architecture and ensures seamless integration of the new capacity. We employ a gradualexpansion strategy, adding a small number of neurons or layers at a time, to avoid sudden changesthat could destabilize the training process. The specific architecture of the added neurons or layersis determined based on the nature of the plasticity loss detected by the diagnostic framework. Thistargeted expansion ensures that the added capacity is effectively utilized to address the specificchallenges posed by plasticity loss. The effectiveness of plasticity injection is rigorously evaluated across a diverse set of challengingRL benchmarks, including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. Thesebenchmarks are carefully selected to represent a wide range of complexities and challenges commonlyencountered in real-world applications. We compare the performance of our approach against severalstate-of-the-art baselines, including methods based on architectural modifications, regularization tech-niques, and meta-learning. The results, presented in , demonstrate a consistent improvementin long-term performance and learning stability across all benchmarks. Furthermore, the diagnosticcomponent of plasticity injection provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms ofplasticity loss, offering a deeper understanding of this critical issue in RL. The detailed experimentalsetup and results are presented in Appendix B. Our methodology contributes significantly to the field of continual learning by providing a novel andefficient approach to address plasticity loss in RL agents. The combination of proactive diagnosis, targeted mitigation, and adaptive capacity expansion allows for a robust and adaptable system thatmaintains high performance over extended periods. The insights gained from this research pave theway for more resilient and long-lasting RL agents, crucial for deploying these agents in complex anddynamic real-world scenarios. Future work will focus on extending the framework to handle evenmore complex environments and integrating it with other advanced RL techniques.",
