  "Abstract": "Drone tracking and localization are essential for various applications, includingmanaging drone formations and implementing anti-drone strategies. Pinpointingand monitoring drones in three-dimensional space is difficult, particularly whentrying to capture the subtle movements of small drones during rapid maneuvers.This involves extracting faint signals from varied flight settings and maintainingalignment despite swift actions. Typically, cameras and LiDAR systems are usedto record the paths of drones. However, they encounter challenges in categorizingdrones and estimating their positions accurately. This report provides an overviewof an approach named CL-Det. It uses a clustering-based learning detection strategyto track and estimate the position of drones using data from two types of LiDARsensors: Livox Avia and LiDAR 360. This method merges data from both LiDARsources to accurately determine the drones location in three dimensions. Themethod begins by synchronizing the time codes of the data from the two sensorsand then isolates the point cloud data for the objects of interest (OOIs) from theenvironmental data. A Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications withNoise (DBSCAN) method is applied to cluster the OOI point cloud data, and thecenter point of the most prominent cluster is taken as the drones location. Thetechnique also incorporates past position estimates to compensate for any missinginformation.",
  "Introduction": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as drones, have gained prominence andsignificantly influence areas like logistics, imaging, and emergency response, offering substantialadvantages to society. However, the broad adoption and sophisticated features of compact, off-the-shelf drones have created intricate security issues that extend beyond conventional risks. Recent years have witnessed a surge in research on anti-UAV systems. Present anti-UAV methodspredominantly utilize visual, radar, and radio frequency (RF) technologies. Despite these strides,recognizing drones poses a considerable hurdle for sensors like cameras, particularly when dronesare at significant altitudes or in challenging visual environments. These methods usually fail to spotsmall drones because of their minimal size, which leads to a decreased radar cross-section and aless noticeable visual presence. Furthermore, current anti-UAV studies primarily focus on detectingobjects and tracking them in two dimensions, overlooking the crucial element of estimating their3D paths. This omission significantly restricts the effectiveness of anti-UAV systems in practical,real-world contexts. Our proposed solution, a detection method based on clustering learning (CL-Det), uses the strengthsof both Livox Avia and LiDAR 360 to improve the tracking and position estimation of UAVs.Initially, the timestamps from the Livox Avia and LiDAR 360 data are aligned to maintain temporalconsistency. By examining the LiDAR data, which contains the spatial coordinates of objects atspecific times, and comparing these to the actual recorded positions of the drone at those times, thedrones location within the LiDAR point cloud data is effectively pinpointed. The point cloud for",

Clustering is executed using the DBSCAN algorithm with appro-priate parameters to guarantee strong clustering. Visual inspection is employed for the preliminaryseparation of points, ensuring an accurate categorization of environment points. The implementation was conducted on a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 Pro (16\") running Windows 11with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU and 16GB DDR4 RAM. The analysis was carried out in aJupyter Notebook environment using Python 3.10. For clustering, the DBSCAN algorithm from theScikit-Learn library was utilized. The DBSCAN algorithm was configured with an epsilon (eps)value of 2 and a minimum number of points (minPts) set to 1.",

The approach guarantees dependable and precise drone position estimation by utilizingmulti-sensor data and robust clustering methods. Fallback mechanisms are in place to ensure con-tinuous position estimation even when primary sensor data is absent. Through thorough parameteroptimization and comparative assessment, the proposed methods effective performance in dronetracking and position estimation is demonstrated."
