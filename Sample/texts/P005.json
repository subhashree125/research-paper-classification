  "Abstract": "This research introduces a comprehensive clothing co-parsing system designedto analyze a collection of clothing images, which are unsegmented but includedescriptive tags. The system aims to segment these images into meaningful config-urations. The proposed method uses a two-stage, data-driven approach. The firststage, termed \"image co-segmentation,\" iteratively refines image regions, usingthe exemplar-SVM (E-SVM) method to enhance region consistency across images.The second stage, \"region co-labeling,\" utilizes a multi-image graphical modelwhere segmented regions serve as nodes. This incorporates contextual informationabout clothing, such as item placement and interactions, which can be solved usingthe efficient Graph Cuts algorithm. The systems performance is tested on theFashionista dataset and a newly developed dataset called CCP, which contains 2098high-resolution street fashion images. The results show a segmentation accuracy of90.29% and 88.23% and a recognition rate of 65.52% and 63.89% on the Fashion-ista and CCP datasets, respectively, demonstrating an improvement over currentleading methods.",
  "Introduction": "The growth of online clothing sales has increased the demand for accurate clothing recognition andretrieval technologies. This has led to the development of several vision-based solutions. A keychallenge in these systems is the detailed, pixel-level labeling of clothing, which is often resource-intensive. However, image-level tags from user data offer a viable alternative. This paper focuseson the development of a system to segment clothing images and assign semantic labels to thesesegments. The main contribution of this work is an effective system for parsing groups of clothing images andproviding precise pixel-level annotations. The system addresses the following significant challenges:",
  "Related Work": "Previous research on clothing and human segmentation has often focused on creating detailed modelsto handle the diversity in clothing styles and appearances. Some of the classic work used And-Orgraph templates to model and parse clothing configurations. Subsequent studies explored blockingmodels for segmenting clothes in images where items were heavily obscured, and deformable spatialmodels to enhance segmentation accuracy. Recent approaches have used shape-based human modelsor combined pose estimation with supervised region labeling, achieving notable results. However,these methods have not been applied to clothing co-parsing and typically demand significant labelingeffort. Research on image/object co-labeling, which jointly processes a set of images containing similarobjects, has been explored. Methods include unsupervised shape-guided approaches for single-category co-labeling and incorporating automatic image segmentation with spatially coherent latenttopic models for unsupervised multi-class labeling. These unsupervised methods can struggle with alarge number of categories and diverse appearances. Recent efforts have focused on supervised labelpropagation, using pixel-level label maps to assign labels to new images. However, these methods areoften limited by the need for detailed annotations and rely on pixel-level correspondences, whichmay not be effective for clothing parsing.",
  "Methodology": "This research introduces a probabilistic model for the co-parsing of clothing images. The inputconsists of a set of clothing images, denoted as I = {Ii}Ni=1, each associated with tags Ti. Eachimage Ii is represented by a set of superpixels, Ii = {sj}Mj=1, which are subsequently grouped intocoherent regions. Each image is associated with four additional variables:",
  "Conclusion": "This paper presents a framework for jointly parsing a collection of clothing images using image-leveltags. The framework includes a new dataset of high-resolution street fashion photos with detailedannotations. The experiments show that the proposed method is effective and performs favorablycompared to existing methods. Future work will focus on improving inference by iterating betweenthe two phases and exploring parallel implementations for large-scale applications."
