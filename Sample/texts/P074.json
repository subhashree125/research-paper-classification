  "Introduction": "This paper addresses the critical Computer vision applications in agricultural domain has becomeone of hot topics nowadays, especially using remote sensing satellite images and aerial images. Withthe rapid development of deep learning methods, numerous research studies have proposed pioneerand practical solutions to various computer vision problems in agriculture. Aside from fruitfulresearch achievements, various algorithm challenges have been held at top-tier conferences forglobal researchers in recent years, in order to explore more effective algorithms to solve the specificproblems. The Agriculture-Vision Challenge is one of most famous and competitive challenges inthis inter-disciplinarity study. It aims at applying computer vision algorithms to agricultural patternrecognition from high-resolution aerial images. This year, holds the 3rd Agriculture-Vision Challenge,and we form our team to participate in this contest.",
  "Description of Dataset": "The challenge this year provides the entire Agriculture-Vision dataset. It contains 94,986 aerialfarmland images collected throughout 2019 across the U.S. Each image has a size of 512512 pixelsand has 4 channels (RGB and NIR). A total of 9 label classes are manually labeled for every image. shows the given amount of images in each class. Note that many images have multiple labels,and even have overlapped labels (one pixel has multiple labels).",
  "Framework": "shows our deep learning-based framework. SegFormer is a Transformer-based efficientsegmentation model. It designs a hierarchical Transformer encoder with multi-level feature outputs.Unlike other cumbersome decoders, SegFormers decoder adopts MLP layers to aggregate multi-scalefeature outputs from different layers. One of the key advantages of SegFormer is that its model sizeis relatively small but the performance keeps outstanding. Therefore, SegFormer is suitable for thischallenge due to the model size parameter limit of 150M. SegFormer provides six versions with various settings of Transformer encoders, leading to differentmodel sizes. These six models are named from B0 to B5, with the increased model size. To followthe policy, we select Mix Transformer (MiT) B3 and Mix Transformer B2 as our training models.Their model size information can be found in Mix Transformer Encoder. After obtainingthe individual inference result from each model, the model ensemble is performed to predict the finalsegmentation results.",
  "Experiment Results": "presents our results, the baseline provided by the host Agriculture-Vision organizers, andthe results of other methods. Note that other baselines evaluate their performance on the validationset due to the unavailable test set. As we can see, while our single model baselines are competitivewith other baselines, our proposed method effectively improves the single model performance. Eventhough some single models have peak performance in some classes (0.778 for Background and0.782 for Water), our model ensemble enjoys the merits of multiple single models strength toachieve the mIoU of 0.582. It also shows that our ensemble results significantly outperform otherbaselines and our implementation of various single models. : Performance comparisons among various models.

  "Conclusion": "This paper presents a novel method In this paper, we propose our solution to the 3rd Agriculture-Vision Challenge. For data usage, we perform data pre-processing and test data augmentation schemes.Several SegFormer models are leveraged. We finally accomplish a mIoU of 0.582, achieving the 2ndplace in this challenge. Future Directions. The potential applications of our proposed algorithm include crop type identifica-tion in precision agriculture, agricultural asset estimation and agricultural insurance product designin the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) domain. These future directions can illuminatethe revitalization of rural areas and facilitate the service of inclusive finance in an eco-friendly way."
