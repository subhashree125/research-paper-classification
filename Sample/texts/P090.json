  "Introduction": "This paper addresses the critical challenge of adapting large pretrained models to new tasks while pre-serving their inherent equivariance properties. Equivariance, a crucial characteristic where a modelsoutput transforms predictably with input transformations, is essential for numerous applications,including image recognition, physics simulations, and various other domains involving structureddata. Standard adaptation methods, such as fine-tuning, often inadvertently disrupt this vital property,leading to performance degradation and reduced generalization capabilities. This disruption stemsfrom the fact that these methods typically ignore the underlying group structure inherent in manydatasets, treating the data as unstructured points in a high-dimensional space. The consequenceis a loss of the inherent symmetries and relationships that are crucial for robust and generalizableperformance. Our work introduces a novel approach that directly addresses this limitation. We propose a method thatexplicitly leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adaptation process, ensuringthat the adapted model retains its equivariance. This is achieved by incorporating a carefully designedregularization scheme derived from group representation theory. This regularization term is integratedinto the standard fine-tuning process, acting as a constraint that encourages the adapted model torespect the underlying group symmetries. The key innovation lies in the explicit consideration of thegroup structure, allowing us to effectively guide the adaptation process while preserving the valuableequivariance properties of the pretrained model. This contrasts sharply with traditional methodsthat treat the adaptation problem as a purely data-driven optimization problem, neglecting the richstructural information embedded within the data. The proposed method builds upon recent advancements in equivariant neural networks, whichhave demonstrated significant promise in various domains. However, existing equivariant networkarchitectures primarily focus on training models from scratch. Our contribution lies in extendingthese techniques to the adaptation setting, enabling us to harness the knowledge encoded in largepretrained models while simultaneously maintaining equivariance. This allows us to leverage thesubstantial computational investment already made in training these large models, avoiding the need",

  "Related Work": "This section reviews existing literature relevant to our work on equivariant adaptation of largepretrained models. Our approach builds upon two primary lines of research: (1) the developmentof equivariant neural networks and (2) the adaptation of pretrained models. We discuss these areasseparately and then highlight the key distinctions of our proposed method. The field of equivariant neural networks has witnessed significant progress in recent years. Thesenetworks are designed to explicitly incorporate group symmetries into their architecture, ensuringthat the models output transforms predictably under group actions on the input. Various architectureshave been proposed, including those based on group convolutions, tensor representations, and othertechniques. These methods have demonstrated impressive results in various domains, such as imageclassification, point cloud processing, and scientific simulations. However, most existing workfocuses on training equivariant networks from scratch, which can be computationally expensive andrequire large amounts of labeled data. Our work addresses this limitation by focusing on adaptingpretrained models, leveraging the knowledge encoded in these models while preserving equivariance. The adaptation of pretrained models is a well-established area of research in deep learning. Techniquessuch as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and domain adaptation have been widely used to adapt pretrainedmodels to new tasks and domains. These methods typically involve adjusting the weights of thepretrained model on a smaller dataset specific to the target task. However, standard adaptationtechniques often fail to preserve the equivariance properties of the pretrained model, leading toperformance degradation. This is because these methods typically treat the data as unstructuredpoints in a high-dimensional space, ignoring the underlying group structure. Our work addresses thislimitation by explicitly incorporating the group structure into the adaptation process, ensuring thatthe adapted model retains its equivariance. Several works have explored the intersection of equivariance and model adaptation. For instance,some studies have investigated adapting equivariant networks to new tasks using techniques suchas knowledge distillation or meta-learning. However, these methods often involve significant mod-ifications to the network architecture or training process. Our approach offers a more direct andefficient method for preserving equivariance during adaptation, by incorporating a regularization termderived from group representation theory into the standard fine-tuning process. This allows us toleverage the benefits of both pretrained models and equivariant networks without requiring significantarchitectural changes. In contrast to previous work, our method uniquely combines the strengths of pretrained models andequivariant neural networks within a unified adaptation framework. We leverage the knowledgeencoded in large pretrained models to accelerate the adaptation process and improve performance,while simultaneously preserving the crucial equivariance properties through a carefully designedregularization scheme. This allows us to achieve superior performance and generalization compared to existing adaptation techniques, particularly in low-data regimes where preserving the inherentsymmetries of the data is crucial. Our approach provides a powerful and efficient method for adaptinglarge pretrained models to new tasks while maintaining their valuable equivariance properties.",
  "Methodology": "This section details the proposed method for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models. Ourapproach leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adaptation process,ensuring that the adapted model retains its equivariance properties. This is achieved through a novelregularization scheme integrated into the standard fine-tuning process. The core idea is to constrainthe adaptation process such that the models output transforms predictably under group actions on theinput, even after adaptation to a new task. This contrasts with traditional fine-tuning, which oftendisrupts these crucial symmetries. We achieve this by explicitly incorporating knowledge of thegroup structure into the optimization process, rather than treating the data as unstructured points ina high-dimensional space. The method is designed to be flexible and applicable to a wide range ofpretrained models and group structures. The computational cost is a consideration, particularly forlarge models and complex groups, but the benefits in terms of improved generalization and robustnessoften outweigh this cost. Further optimization strategies are explored in the discussion section. Our method begins by identifying the relevant group structure inherent in the data. This involvesdetermining the appropriate group actions and representations that capture the symmetries of the inputand output spaces. For example, in image processing, this might involve the group of rotations andtranslations. Once the group structure is identified, we construct a regularization term based on grouprepresentation theory. This term penalizes deviations from equivariance during the adaptation process.Specifically, the regularization term measures the discrepancy between the models output under agroup action and the transformed output predicted by the model. This discrepancy is minimizedduring training, ensuring that the adapted model remains approximately equivariant. The strength ofthe regularization is controlled by a hyperparameter, allowing for a trade-off between equivariancepreservation and adaptation to the new task. The choice of this hyperparameter is crucial and isdetermined through cross-validation. The regularization term is incorporated into the standard fine-tuning loss function. The overall lossfunction is then a weighted sum of the task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy for classification) and theequivariance regularization term. The weights determine the relative importance of task performanceand equivariance preservation. The adapted model is trained by minimizing this combined lossfunction using standard optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.The specific optimization algorithm and hyperparameters are chosen based on the characteristicsof the dataset and the pretrained model. Careful selection of these hyperparameters is crucial forachieving optimal performance. We employ a grid search to identify the best hyperparameter settingsfor each experiment. The implementation of our method involves modifying the standard fine-tuning process to includethe equivariance regularization term. This requires access to the pretrained models weights andarchitecture, as well as the group representation associated with the data. The regularization termis computed efficiently using techniques from group representation theory, minimizing the com-putational overhead. The modified training process is implemented using standard deep learningframeworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The code is publicly available to facilitate reproducibilityand further research. The implementation details, including the specific group representations andoptimization strategies, are provided in the supplementary material. Finally, the adapted model is evaluated on a held-out test set to assess its performance on the newtask. The evaluation metrics are chosen based on the specific task, such as accuracy for classificationor mean average precision (mAP) for object detection. The performance of the adapted model iscompared to that of models adapted using traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art adaptationtechniques. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in preserving equivariance whileachieving high performance on the new task. A detailed analysis of the results is presented in thenext section.",
