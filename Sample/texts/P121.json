  "Introduction": "The objective of this research is to address the phenomenon of plasticity loss in deep reinforcementlearning (RL) agents , where neural networks lose their ability to learn effectively over time.This persistent challenge significantly hinders the long-term performance and adaptability of RLagents in dynamic environments. Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications orhyperparameter tuning , which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability. Ourwork introduces a novel intervention, termed \"plasticity injection,\" designed to directly tackle theroot causes of plasticity loss. This approach offers a more efficient and adaptable solution comparedto existing methods, addressing the limitations of previous strategies that often involve extensivehyperparameter searches or complex architectural changes. The core innovation lies in its abilityto proactively diagnose and mitigate plasticity loss without significantly increasing computationaldemands. Plasticity injection operates on three key principles. First, it provides a diagnostic framework foridentifying the onset and severity of plasticity loss within an RL agent. This diagnostic capabilityallows for proactive intervention before performance degradation becomes significant, preventingcatastrophic forgetting and maintaining consistent performance over extended training periods. Thediagnostic framework leverages novel metrics that capture subtle changes in network behavior,providing early warning signals of impending plasticity loss. This proactive approach contrasts withreactive methods that only address plasticity loss after significant performance decline has alreadyoccurred. Second, plasticity injection mitigates plasticity loss without requiring an increase in the number oftrainable parameters or alterations to the networks prediction capabilities. This ensures that thecomputational overhead remains minimal while maintaining the integrity of the learned policy. Thisis achieved through a carefully designed mechanism that selectively modifies the networks internaldynamics rather than its overall architecture. This targeted approach minimizes the risk of disruptingthe agents learned behavior while effectively addressing the underlying causes of plasticity loss.The preservation of prediction capabilities is crucial for maintaining the agents performance in itsoperational environment. Third, the method dynamically expands network capacity only when necessary, leading to improvedcomputational efficiency during training. This adaptive capacity allocation avoids unnecessaryresource consumption during periods of stable performance. The dynamic expansion mechanism istriggered by the diagnostic framework, ensuring that resources are allocated only when needed to",
  "Related Work": "The problem of plasticity loss, or catastrophic forgetting, in neural networks has been extensivelystudied across various machine learning domains . In the context of deep reinforcement learning(RL), this phenomenon manifests as a decline in an agents ability to learn new tasks or adaptto changing environments after it has already acquired a certain level of proficiency. Traditionalapproaches to mitigate this issue often involve architectural modifications, such as employing separatenetworks for different tasks , or utilizing techniques like regularization and replay buffers topreserve previously learned knowledge. However, these methods can be computationally expensive,particularly for large-scale RL agents, and may not always effectively prevent plasticity loss incomplex scenarios. Furthermore, many existing methods focus on reactive solutions, addressingplasticity loss only after it has already occurred, rather than proactively preventing it. Our work differssignificantly by introducing a proactive diagnostic framework coupled with a targeted interventionthat minimizes computational overhead. Several studies have explored the use of dynamic network architectures to improve the efficiency andadaptability of RL agents . These approaches often involve mechanisms for adding or removingneurons or layers based on the agents performance or the complexity of the environment. However,these methods typically focus on optimizing the networks overall structure rather than directlyaddressing the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss. In contrast, our plasticity injection methodselectively modifies the networks internal dynamics without altering its overall architecture, allowingfor a more targeted and efficient approach to mitigating plasticity loss. This targeted approach avoidsthe potential disruption of learned policies that can occur with more drastic architectural changes.The dynamic capacity expansion in our method is also triggered by a diagnostic framework, ensuringthat resources are allocated only when necessary, unlike many existing dynamic architecture methodsthat may allocate resources inefficiently. Another line of research focuses on improving the stability and robustness of RL training throughtechniques such as curriculum learning and meta-learning . Curriculum learning graduallyintroduces increasingly complex tasks to the agent, allowing it to build a robust foundation ofknowledge before tackling more challenging problems. Meta-learning aims to train agents thatcan quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal training data. While these methods can indirectlycontribute to mitigating plasticity loss by improving the agents overall learning stability, they do notdirectly address the specific mechanisms underlying the phenomenon. Our approach complementsthese methods by providing a targeted intervention that directly tackles the root causes of plasticityloss, enhancing the effectiveness of existing training strategies. The diagnostic component of ourframework also offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss, which caninform the development of even more effective training strategies. The concept of \"plasticity\" itself has been extensively studied in neuroscience , where it refersto the brains ability to adapt and reorganize its structure and function in response to experience.Our work draws inspiration from these neuroscientific findings, aiming to emulate the brains abilityto dynamically adjust its internal mechanisms to maintain learning capacity over time. However,unlike biological systems, our approach focuses on developing computationally efficient and scalablemethods for achieving this dynamic adaptation in artificial neural networks. The modular designof our plasticity injection framework allows for easy integration with various RL algorithms andarchitectures, making it a versatile tool for enhancing the robustness and longevity of RL agentsacross a wide range of applications. Future research will explore the integration of plasticity injection",
  "Methodology": "The core of our approach, termed \"plasticity injection,\" revolves around three interconnected compo-nents: a diagnostic framework, a mitigation strategy, and a dynamic capacity allocation mechanism.These components work in concert to proactively identify, address, and adapt to the onset of plasticityloss in RL agents. The diagnostic framework continuously monitors key network metrics duringtraining, providing early warning signals of potential plasticity loss. These metrics are carefullyselected to capture subtle changes in network behavior that might precede significant performancedegradation. We employ a combination of established metrics, such as learning rate decay and lossfunction fluctuations, alongside novel metrics specifically designed to detect subtle shifts in thenetworks internal representations. These novel metrics are based on analyzing the distribution ofactivations within different layers of the network, providing a more granular understanding of thenetworks internal dynamics. The choice of metrics is informed by our preliminary experiments andtheoretical analysis of plasticity loss mechanisms. The diagnostic framework outputs a plasticityscore, a continuous value reflecting the severity of detected plasticity loss. This score serves as atrigger for the mitigation and capacity allocation mechanisms. Our mitigation strategy focuses on selectively modifying the networks internal dynamics rather thanits overall architecture. This targeted approach avoids the computational overhead and potentialdisruption of learned policies associated with architectural modifications. The strategy involves acarefully designed set of operations applied to the networks weight matrices and biases. Theseoperations are guided by the plasticity score, with stronger interventions applied when the scoreindicates a higher level of plasticity loss. The specific operations are chosen to enhance the networksability to learn new information without disrupting previously acquired knowledge. We exploreseveral different operation types, including weight normalization, regularization techniques, andtargeted pruning of less relevant connections. The optimal set of operations and their parameters aredetermined through a hyperparameter search conducted on a subset of our benchmark tasks. Theeffectiveness of the mitigation strategy is evaluated by comparing the long-term performance ofagents with and without plasticity injection. The dynamic capacity allocation mechanism complements the mitigation strategy by adaptivelyexpanding the networks capacity only when necessary. This mechanism is triggered by the plasticityscore, with the degree of capacity expansion directly proportional to the severity of detected plasticityloss. The capacity expansion is implemented by adding new neurons or layers to the network, withthe specific architecture of the added components determined based on the nature of the detectedplasticity loss. For instance, if the diagnostic framework identifies a loss of capacity in a specificlayer, new neurons are added to that layer. This targeted approach ensures that resources are allocatedefficiently, avoiding unnecessary computational overhead during periods of stable performance. Theadded capacity is integrated seamlessly into the existing network architecture, minimizing disruptionto the learned policy. The effectiveness of the dynamic capacity allocation is evaluated by comparingthe computational efficiency and long-term performance of agents with and without this mechanism. The entire plasticity injection framework is implemented as a modular component that can be easilyintegrated with various RL algorithms and architectures. This modularity allows for flexibility andadaptability to different RL tasks and environments. The framework is designed to be computationallyefficient, minimizing the overhead associated with diagnosis, mitigation, and capacity allocation. Thecomputational efficiency is achieved through careful optimization of the algorithms and data structuresused in each component. The frameworks performance is evaluated across a range of challenging RLbenchmarks, including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. The resultsdemonstrate a consistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared tostate-of-the-art baselines. Our experimental setup involves a rigorous evaluation across diverse RL environments, encompassingboth continuous control tasks and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Wecompare the performance of RL agents employing plasticity injection against several state-of-the-artbaselines, including those utilizing established techniques for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Theevaluation metrics include long-term performance, learning stability, and computational efficiency. We analyze the results to assess the effectiveness of each component of the plasticity injectionframework and to identify potential areas for future improvement.
