  "Introduction": "To address the challenges of temporal asynchrony and limited communication bandwidth in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection, this paper introduces Feature Flow Net(FFNet), a novel framework that transmits compressed feature flow rather than raw data or featuremaps. This approach aims to enhance detection performance, reduce transmission costs, and handletemporal misalignment effectively. The core innovation lies in leveraging the inherent temporalcoherence present in consecutive frames of a video stream. Instead of transmitting the entirety offeature maps for each frame, FFNet computes a compact representation of the changes betweenconsecutive frames, termed \"feature flow.\" This representation efficiently captures the motion andevolution of objects within the scene. By focusing on these dynamic aspects, FFNet significantlyreduces the data transmission volume, thereby mitigating bandwidth limitations. The efficiencygains are particularly crucial in resource-constrained environments typical of vehicle-to-infrastructurecommunication. Furthermore, the robustness to temporal asynchrony is a key advantage, allowing forreliable operation even with delays and jitter inherent in real-world communication channels. The design of FFNet incorporates several key modules. Firstly, a feature extraction module processesinput frames to generate high-dimensional feature maps. These maps are then fed into a flowestimation module, which computes the optical flow between consecutive frames. This optical flowfield is subsequently used to warp features from the preceding frame, aligning them with the currentframes features. The difference between these warped features and the current frames featuresconstitutes the feature flow. This difference is then compressed using a learned compression scheme,carefully designed to minimize information loss while maximizing the compression ratio. Theselection of an appropriate compression algorithm is critical to balancing the trade-off between datareduction and preservation of essential information for accurate object detection. The compressed feature flow is transmitted to a central processing unit (CPU), where its used toupdate the feature maps from the previous frame. This updated feature map then serves as inputfor the object detection process. The utilization of feature flow enables efficient updates, evenin the presence of temporal misalignment between frames received from disparate sources. Thisresilience to asynchrony is a significant advantage over methods requiring strict synchronization. Theproposed method is rigorously evaluated on a large-scale VIC3D dataset, demonstrating substantial",
  "improvements in detection accuracy and communication efficiency compared to baseline methodsthat transmit raw data or full feature maps ??": "Further validation of FFNets robustness to temporal asynchrony is provided through extensive exper-iments involving varying levels of delay and jitter in the simulated communication channel. Resultsconsistently show that FFNet maintains high detection accuracy even under significant temporalmisalignment, surpassing existing methods reliant on strict synchronization ?. This robustness stemsfrom the ability of feature flow to capture the essential scene changes, irrespective of minor temporaldiscrepancies. A detailed analysis of the compression schemes efficiency reveals a substantialreduction in bandwidth consumption compared to transmitting raw data or full feature maps. Finally, the influence of different compression parameters on detection performance and communica-tion efficiency is thoroughly investigated. The findings offer insights into the optimal balance betweencompression ratio and detection accuracy, enabling adaptive adjustment of compression parametersbased on available bandwidth and desired detection performance. The FFNet framework presents apromising solution for efficient and robust VIC3D object detection in challenging communicationenvironments. Future work will explore extensions to handle more complex scenarios, such asocclusions and varying weather conditions ?.",
  "Related Work": "The problem of efficient data transmission in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication for 3Dobject detection has received considerable attention. Early approaches focused on transmitting rawsensor data, such as point clouds or images, directly to a central processing unit for processing ?.However, this approach suffers from high bandwidth requirements and is susceptible to delays andpacket loss, particularly in challenging communication environments. Subsequent work explored theuse of compressed sensing techniques to reduce the amount of data transmitted ?, but these methodsoften introduce significant information loss, leading to a degradation in detection performance.Furthermore, the synchronization requirements of these methods can be stringent, making them lessrobust to temporal asynchrony. More recent research has investigated the use of feature maps instead of raw data for transmission.These methods typically involve extracting features from sensor data at the edge and transmittingthese features to a central server for object detection. While this approach reduces the amount of datatransmitted compared to transmitting raw data, it still requires significant bandwidth, especially forhigh-resolution sensor data. Moreover, the sensitivity to temporal misalignment remains a challenge.Several works have explored techniques for improving the robustness of feature-based methods totemporal asynchrony, such as using temporal smoothing filters or predictive models ?. However,these methods often introduce computational overhead and may not be effective in scenarios withsignificant delays or jitter. Our work differs from previous approaches by focusing on transmitting only the changes in featuresbetween consecutive frames, rather than the entire feature maps. This approach, based on theconcept of feature flow, significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted whilemaintaining high detection accuracy. Existing methods that utilize optical flow for object trackingor video compression typically operate on pixel-level data or low-level features. In contrast, FFNetoperates on high-level features extracted from a deep convolutional neural network, allowing fora more robust and efficient representation of the scene dynamics. This allows for a more compactrepresentation of the scene changes, leading to significant bandwidth savings. The use of learned compression schemes further distinguishes our approach. Unlike traditional com-pression methods that rely on generic compression algorithms, FFNet employs a learned compressionscheme specifically tailored to the characteristics of feature flow. This allows for a better balancebetween compression ratio and information preservation, leading to improved detection performance.Furthermore, the adaptive nature of the compression scheme allows for dynamic adjustment of thecompression parameters based on the available bandwidth and desired detection performance. Thisadaptability is crucial in dynamic communication environments where bandwidth availability canfluctuate significantly.",
  "Methodology": "The proposed Feature Flow Net (FFNet) framework addresses the challenges of temporal asynchronyand limited bandwidth in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection by trans-mitting compressed feature flow instead of raw data or full feature maps. This approach leverages thetemporal coherence inherent in video streams, focusing on the dynamic changes between consecutiveframes rather than transmitting redundant information. The core of FFNet consists of three mainmodules: feature extraction, flow estimation, and compression. The feature extraction module employs a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), such asResNet or EfficientNet, to process input frames and generate high-dimensional feature maps. Thesefeature maps capture rich semantic information about the scene, providing a robust representationfor subsequent processing. The choice of CNN architecture is crucial for balancing computationalcomplexity and feature representation quality. We experimented with several architectures andselected the one that provided the best trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. Theoutput of this module is a sequence of feature maps, one for each frame in the video stream. The flow estimation module computes the optical flow between consecutive feature maps. This isachieved using a deep learning-based optical flow estimation network, such as FlowNet or PWC-Net.The optical flow field represents the motion of features between frames, providing a measure of howfeatures move and change over time. This optical flow is then used to warp the features from theprevious frame to align them with the current frame. This warping step is crucial for accuratelyrepresenting the changes in features, as it accounts for the motion of objects in the scene. Theaccuracy of the optical flow estimation is critical for the overall performance of FFNet. The difference between the warped features from the previous frame and the current frames featuresconstitutes the feature flow. This feature flow represents the dynamic changes in the scene, capturingthe motion and evolution of objects. The feature flow is then compressed using a learned compressionscheme, which is trained to minimize information loss while maximizing compression ratio. Thiscompression scheme is crucial for reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. Weexplored various compression techniques, including autoencoders and learned quantization methods,and selected the one that provided the best balance between compression ratio and reconstructionaccuracy. The compressed feature flow is then transmitted to the central processing unit. At the central processing unit, the received compressed feature flow is decompressed and used toupdate the feature maps from the previous frame. This updated feature map is then used for objectdetection using a suitable object detection network. The use of feature flow allows for efficientupdates, even in the presence of temporal misalignment between frames. The robustness of FFNetto temporal asynchrony is a key advantage, allowing for reliable operation even with delays andjitter inherent in real-world communication channels. The entire process, from feature extraction toobject detection, is optimized for efficiency and robustness, making FFNet a suitable solution forresource-constrained environments.

FFNet maintained high detection accuracy even undersignificant temporal misalignment, outperforming synchronization-dependent baseline methods.Specifically, FFNets mAP remained above 85% even with a delay of up to 200ms and jitter of upto 50ms. This robustness is attributed to feature flows ability to capture essential scene changesregardless of minor temporal discrepancies.
