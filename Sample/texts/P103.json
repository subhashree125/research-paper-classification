  "Introduction": "This paper addresses the critical need for effective methods to translate natural language descriptionsinto executable command-line instructions. The command line interface (CLI) is an important toolfor software development due to its expressiveness and efficiency. While GUIs have difficultieskeeping up with the rapid pace of new features in software development, CLIs provide a text-basedinterface to a wide range of software functionalities. The use of natural language for CLI interactioncould transform how people interact with various operating systems and cloud platforms. This paperexplores the possibilities of leveraging natural language to interact with CLIs making computationalresources more accessible to a wider range of users.",
  "Anlc {p | p = (c, )}; |A(nlc)| < k": "Each prediction from the model includes a set of Bash commands along with a confidence score,, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. This confidence score can be utilized to filter out uncertain predictionsand is incorporated into the evaluation process. The default confidence is set to 1.0, indicating fullconfidence in the models prediction.",
  "Competition Overview": "The competition occurred between July and November of 2020, encompassing training, validation,and testing phases. A total of 20 teams registered for the competition, and among these, 9 teamsparticipated through the end of the testing phase. The teams were allowed 100 submissions in thefirst two phases, and a maximum of 10 submissions for the final phase, with daily submission limits.The EvalAI platform was used for hosting the competition.",
  "Data partitions and pipeline": "The data was filtered for each data sample through a Bash parser to ensure that only valid Bashcommands were included. Any text that was not a valid Bash command or used utilities not in theUbuntu 18.04 LTS command set was removed. For training, participants were provided with a filteredversion of the NL2Bash dataset, as well as man pages for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. In addition, participantswere allowed to use any other publicly available data for training. The data set was split into training,validation and test sets with different sizes for each. In addition to the original utilities of the firstphase of the competition, 27 additional utilities were added in subsequent phases.",
  "Accuracy": "This section discusses the metrics used to evaluate the task of translating natural language to Bashcode. Existing metrics such as Full Command Accuracy, BLEU score, and Template Accuracy, arereviewed and it is found that they all have shortcomings. The paper presents a metric, verificationby execution, which is able to solve these problems. Finally, the metric that was proposed for thecompetition is discussed in depth.",
  "Energy Efficiency": "This section discusses the metric of energy efficiency of models, and its relevance in the currentresearch environment. The energy consumption of machine learning models is an area of focus, withthe deployment of these models, their inference phase energy consumption can outweigh their trainingcost over time. The experiment-impact-tracker library was used to measure the energy consumptionof submitted solutions.",
  "Suggested Alternatives for Accuracy Measurement": "Some suggestions for future metrics include: a metric that measures semantic match instead ofexact command matching; restricting the range of commands covered; a metric that measures meanreciprocal rank; a metric that measures session scores over multiple interactions instead of one; usingadaptability of algorithms; making fast retraining available; and calibration of penalties. The issuesof statefulness of commands, command injection, full text match and underdetermined invocationsare also reviewed.",
  "Suggested Alternatives for Energy Measurement": "The issues with power measurement, such as reducing computation to lower peak consumption arediscussed. It is stated that measurement of total energy consumption may be a better solution. It isargued whether there is even any point to measuring energy at all due to how small the amount ofenergy is consumed."
