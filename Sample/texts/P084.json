  "Abstract": "This research investigates the congruence between research in major computervision conferences and the tenets of the \"hard-won lesson\" articulated by RichSutton. Utilizing large language models (LLMs), we scrutinize twenty years ofabstracts and titles from these conferences to evaluate the fields acceptance of thesecore concepts. Our approach employs cutting-edge natural language processingmethodologies to methodically chart the progression of research paradigms withincomputer vision. The findings indicate notable patterns in the implementation ofgeneralized learning algorithms and the exploitation of enhanced computationalcapabilities. We analyze the ramifications of these discoveries for the prospectivetrajectory of computer vision research and its conceivable influence on the broaderdevelopment of artificial intelligence. This investigation contributes to the persistentdiscourse regarding the most efficacious methods for propelling machine learningand computer vision forward, furnishing perspectives that could steer forthcomingresearch orientations and techniques in these domains.",
  "Introduction": "Rich Suttons seminal paper, \"The Hard-Won Lesson,\" posits that the most substantial progress inartificial intelligence (AI) has resulted from concentrating on broad methods that utilize computation,as opposed to human-derived representations and knowledge. This concept has been notably appar-ent in Computer Vision (CV), a domain that has observed a discernible transition from manuallyengineered features to deep learning frameworks. In this article, we explore the degree to which the abstracts from a prominent machine learning (ML)conference align with the principles of the \"hard-won lesson\" across two decades. Our analysisencompasses a randomized selection of 200 papers annually, addressing these research questions:",
  "The Hard-Won Lesson": "The realm of artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced a fundamental change, eloquently expressedin Rich Suttons influential essay \"The Hard-Won Lesson.\" Suttons central idea underscores theimportance of generalized methods that utilize computational capability over human-engineeredrepresentations and domain-specific expertise. This viewpoint resonates with Leo Breimans earlierwork, which, twenty years prior, outlined the distinction between statistical and algorithmic methodsin his paper \"Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures.\" Breimans insights, along with subsequentcontributions, have significantly influenced our comprehension of data-oriented approaches in AI.",
  "Evolution of Computer Vision": "The discipline of Computer Vision (CV) serves as a prime illustration of the concepts articulated inSuttons \"hard-won lesson.\" Historically dependent on manually designed features such as SIFT, HOG,and Haar cascades for object recognition and image categorization, CV experienced a transformationwith the introduction of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This shiftfacilitated the automated acquisition of hierarchical features directly from unprocessed image data,thereby bypassing the necessity for manual feature creation and markedly enhancing performanceacross a range of CV applications. The emergence of foundational models further aligned CV with Suttons principles. Models likeCLIP, ALIGN, and Florence demonstrate remarkable adaptability across diverse tasks with minimalfine-tuning, leveraging extensive multi-modal datasets to learn rich, transferable representations. This progression from conventional feature engineering to deep learning and foundational modelsin CV highlights the significance of employing computational resources and extensive datasets toachieve enhanced performance and generalization.",
  "Large Language Models in Academic Evaluation": "The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the assessment of scholarly texts hasbecome a notable area of focus. LLMs, like GPT-4, have shown impressive abilities in swiftly handlingand examining vast quantities of data, making them appropriate for numerous uses, including theevaluation of academic papers. Beyond their analytical abilities, LLMs have been shown to possess a degree of human-like judgmentin assessing the quality of text. The G-EVAL framework, which employs LLMs to evaluate thequality of natural language generation outputs, demonstrates that LLMs can closely align with humanevaluators in certain contexts. However, deploying LLMs in academic evaluation is not without itschallenges. LLMs can exhibit biases similar to those found in human judgments, which may affectthe fairness and accuracy of their evaluations. The function of LLMs in responding to inquiries and formulating hypotheses also deserves considera-tion. Their capacity to furnish comprehensive answers to intricate queries has been utilized in diverseeducational environments, enhancing learning experiences and facilitating knowledge acquisition. Inthe context of academic research, LLMs can aid in generating hypotheses and guiding exploratorystudies, contributing to the advancement of knowledge in various fields.",
  "LLM Evaluation of Titles and Abstracts": "We utilize three large language models to assess the titles and abstracts of papers: GPT-4o-2024-05-13, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, and claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620. The following details are extractedfrom online sources and stored in a database for each paper: Year of Publication (2005-2024), Title,Authors, and Abstract. Additionally, the citation count for each paper is obtained from the SemanticScholar API on July 20th, 2024, and recorded alongside the other metadata. Each LLM is assigned the task of providing a Likert score ranging from 0 to 10, indicating the degreeto which a paper corresponds with the principles outlined in Suttons \"hard-won lesson.\" We employthe Chain-of-Thought Prompting method in conjunction with the Magentic library to interact withthe models and accumulate their feedback in a structured manner for subsequent analysis.",
  "We establish five dimensions for alignment with the \"hard-won lesson\":": "1. **Learning Over Engineering:** How much does the idea prioritize using computation throughdata-driven learning and statistical methods over human-engineered knowledge and domain expertise?2. **Search over Heuristics:** To what extent does the idea emphasize leveraging computationthrough search algorithms and optimization techniques instead of relying on human-designed heuris-tics? 3. **Scalability with Computation:** How much is the idea based on methods that cancontinuously scale and improve performance as computational resources increase? 4. **Generalityover Specificity:** How much does the approach emphasize general, flexible methods that learn fromdata rather than building complex models of the world through manual engineering? 5. **FavoringFundamental Principles:** To what extent does the approach adhere to fundamental principles ofcomputation and information theory rather than emulating human cognition? The prompts were crafted to encapsulate the core of each \"hard-won lesson\" dimension in a succinctand impartial manner. To standardize the ratings, we furnish examples for the 0, 5, and 10 points oneach dimension, elucidating the standards and guaranteeing uniform evaluations. Given the large number of publications, our research concentrates on a representative random sampleof 200 papers from each year. We define the overall alignment score for each paper as the sum ofscores across the five dimensions.",
  "Inter-rater Reliability Measures": "**Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC):** We employ ICC to measure the level of agreementamong the models evaluations. ICC is especially fitting for evaluating reliability when numerousraters assess an identical set of items. Specifically, we utilize the two-way random effects model(ICC(2,k)) to consider both rater and subject influences. **Krippendorffs Alpha:** In addition to ICC, we compute Krippendorffs Alpha, a flexible reliabilitycoefficient capable of managing diverse data types (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio) and resilient tomissing data. This metric offers an supplementary viewpoint on inter-rater agreement, particularlybeneficial when addressing potential variations in rating scales or absent evaluations.",
  "Regression Analysis": "presents the regression analysis results for each dimension of \"hard-won lesson\" alignmentscores against citation impact, stratified by year of publication. The R-squared values range from0.027 to 0.306. In this regression analysis, a multiplicative effect implies that a one-unit change in the alignmentscore for a particular dimension leads to a proportional change in the original scale of the citationcount. The statistical significance of the regression coefficients is denoted using , , and to represent the10%, 5%, and 1% significance levels, respectively. Several dimensions, such as \"Scalability\" and\"Learning over engineering,\" exhibit statistically significant relationships with citation impact acrossmultiple years. shows the results of regressing citation counts on the overall \"hard-won lesson\" alignmentscore for each year between 2005 and 2024. The R-squared values are quite low for most years butincrease substantially starting in 2015.",
  "Inter-rater Reliability": "The models show consistently strong agreement on all dimensions except \"Favoring FundamentalPrinciples,\" as indicated by ICC values above 0.5 and Krippendorffs alpha scores exceeding 0.4 onthe remaining dimensions. The dimension \"Learning Over Engineering\" exhibits the highest ICC andKrippendorffs alpha scores. Although perfect agreement is not achieved, the inter-reliability measures fall within or abovecommon thresholds for \"good\" reliability, validating the use of AI models for prompt-based researchpaper evaluation.",
  "Conclusion": "Our study scrutinized the concordance of research with Rich Suttons \"hard-won lesson\" over twodecades, employing large language models to analyze trends. The results show a steady rise inthe adoption of general-purpose learning algorithms and scalability with computational resources,indicating a strong adherence to the core principles of the \"hard-won lesson.\" These trends highlightthe machine learning communitys inclination towards data-driven and computation-intensive methodsover manual engineering and domain-specific knowledge. However, the \"Search over Heuristics\" dimension has not shown a similar upward trend, suggestinglimited integration of search-based methods in the field. This stagnation contrasts with recent progressin inference-time scaling, exemplified by OpenAIs o1 models, which emphasize the importance oftest-time computation in overcoming diminishing returns. The shift towards scaling inference time, driven by the development of larger and more complexmodels, has the potential to emulate search-like processes. As computational capabilities continue toexpand, it is plausible that future research may increasingly incorporate search techniques, therebyenhancing alignment with this dimension of the \"hard-won lesson.\"",
  "*** indicates significance at the 1% level, ** indicates significance at the 5% level, and * indicates significance at the 10% level": "In summary, our findings underscore the enduring significance of the \"hard-won lesson\" in shapingthe path of computer vision research. By emphasizing generality and scalability, the field is well-positioned to leverage emerging computational advancements. Future work should explore theintegration of search methodologies and assess their impact on research impact and innovation withincomputer vision, particularly in light of recent breakthroughs in inference-time scaling.",
  "Limitations": "This study has several limitations. First, our reliance on large language models (LLMs) for evaluatingresearch abstracts introduces potential biases inherent to these models. Second, the absence of humanexpert evaluation as a ground truth is a significant limitation. Furthermore, our analysis is limited to the information contained in titles and abstracts, which maynot capture the full depth and nuance of the methodologies and findings presented in the full papers.Lastly, while our study spans two decades of proceedings, it does not account for research publishedin other venues or unpublished work that may have influenced the field. Despite these limitations, we believe our study provides valuable insights into broad trends incomputer vision research and its alignment with the principles of the \"hard-won lesson.\" Futurework could address these limitations by incorporating human expert evaluations, analyzing full papercontents, and expanding the scope to include a wider range of publication venues.",
  "Ethics Statement": "This study adheres to ethical guidelines. Our use of large language models (LLMs) for analyzingtrends in academic literature raises important ethical considerations. We acknowledge that LLMsmay introduce biases when used for direct evaluation of academic work. However, our study focusessolely on using LLMs to analyze broad trends rather than to assess individual papers quality or merit."
